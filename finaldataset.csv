0,"Tracking changes in SARS-CoV-2 transmission with a novel outpatient sentinel surveillance system in Chicago, USA","Public health indicators typically used for COVID-19 surveillance can be biased or lag changing community transmission patterns. In this study, we investigate whether sentinel surveillance of recently symptomatic individuals receiving outpatient diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 could accurately assess the instantaneous reproductive number R(t) and provide early warning of changes in transmission. We use data from community-based diagnostic testing sites in the United States city of Chicago. Patients tested at community-based diagnostic testing sites between September 2020 and June 2021, and reporting symptom onset within four days preceding their test, formed the sentinel population. R(t) calculated from sentinel cases agreed well with R(t) from other indicators. Retrospectively, trends in sentinel cases did not precede trends in COVID-19 hospital admissions by any identifiable lead time. In deployment, sentinel surveillance held an operational recency advantage of nine days over hospital admissions. The promising performance of opportunistic sentinel surveillance suggests that deliberately designed outpatient sentinel surveillance would provide robust early warning of increasing transmission.","In this study, the authors develop a method for estimation of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission rates based on a sentinel population of people seeking outpatient testing with recent symptom onset. This method has fewer operational delays than methods based on hospital data, and may be subject to fewer biases.",2022-09-22
1,Engineering SARS-CoV-2 specific cocktail antibodies into a bispecific format improves neutralizing potency and breadth,"One major limitation of neutralizing antibody-based COVID-19 therapy is the requirement of costly cocktails to reduce emergence of antibody resistance. Here we engineer two bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) using distinct designs and compared them with parental antibodies and their cocktail. Single molecules of both bsAbs block the two epitopes targeted by parental antibodies on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, bsAb with the IgG-(scFv)2 design (14-H-06) but not the CrossMAb design (14-crs-06) shows increased antigen-binding and virus-neutralizing activities against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as increased breadth of neutralizing activity compared to the cocktail. X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM reveal distinct binding models for individual cocktail antibodies, and computational simulations suggest higher inter-spike crosslinking potentials by 14-H-06 than 14-crs-06. In mouse models of infections by SARS-CoV-2 and multiple variants, 14-H-06 exhibits higher or equivalent therapeutic efficacy than the cocktail. Rationally engineered bsAbs represent a cost-effective alternative to antibody cocktails and a promising strategy to improve potency and breadth.","Bispecific antibodies can have advantages compared to antibody cocktails. Here, the authors engineer and characterize two different approaches for generating bispecific SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and find that only one design increases antigen-binding and virus neutralizing activities.",2022-09-22
2,Wireless multi-lateral optofluidic microsystems for real-time programmable optogenetics and photopharmacology,"In vivo optogenetics and photopharmacology are two techniques for controlling neuronal activity that have immense potential in neuroscience research. Their applications in tether-free groups of animals have been limited in part due to tools availability. Here, we present a wireless, battery-free, programable multilateral optofluidic platform with user-selected modalities for optogenetics, pharmacology and photopharmacology. This system features mechanically compliant microfluidic and electronic interconnects, capabilities for dynamic control over the rates of drug delivery and real-time programmability, simultaneously for up to 256 separate devices in a single cage environment. Our behavioral experiments demonstrate control of motor behaviors in grouped mice through in vivo optogenetics with co-located gene delivery and controlled photolysis of caged glutamate. These optofluidic systems may expand the scope of wireless techniques to study neural processing in animal models.",Wireless delivery of both light and pharmacological agents is important for optogenetic and other mechanistic experiments in the brain. Here the authors present a wireless real-time programmable optofluidic platform that enables optogenetics and photopharmacology experiments that require real-time precise control of light and drug delivery.,2022-09-22
3,IL-23 signaling prevents ferroptosis-driven renal immunopathology during candidiasis,"During infection the host relies on pattern-recognition receptors to sense invading fungal pathogens to launch immune defense mechanisms. While fungal recognition and immune effector responses are organ and cell type specific, during disseminated candidiasis myeloid cells exacerbate collateral tissue damage. The β-glucan receptor ephrin type-A 2 receptor (EphA2) is required to initiate mucosal inflammatory responses during oral Candida infection. Here we report that EphA2 promotes renal immunopathology during disseminated candidiasis. EphA2 deficiency leads to reduced renal inflammation and injury. Comprehensive analyses reveal that EphA2 restrains IL-23 secretion from and migration of dendritic cells. IL-23 signaling prevents ferroptotic host cell death during infection to limit inflammation and immunopathology. Further, host cell ferroptosis limits antifungal effector functions via releasing the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal to induce various forms of cell death. Thus, we identify ferroptotic cell death as a critical pathway of Candida-mediated renal immunopathology that opens a new avenue to tackle Candida infection and inflammation.","The beta-glucan receptor EphA2 is known to maintain mucosal immunity. Here, its role in modulating renal immunopathology via IL-23 signalling and ferroptotic cell death during candidiasis is characterised.",2022-09-22
4,Topical application of an irreversible small molecule inhibitor of lysyl oxidases ameliorates skin scarring and fibrosis,"Scarring is a lifelong consequence of skin injury, with scar stiffness and poor appearance presenting physical and psychological barriers to a return to normal life. Lysyl oxidases are a family of enzymes that play a critical role in scar formation and maintenance. Lysyl oxidases stabilize the main component of scar tissue, collagen, and drive scar stiffness and appearance. Here we describe the development and characterisation of an irreversible lysyl oxidase inhibitor, PXS-6302. PXS-6302 is ideally suited for skin treatment, readily penetrating the skin when applied as a cream and abolishing lysyl oxidase activity. In murine models of injury and fibrosis, topical application reduces collagen deposition and cross-linking. Topical application of PXS-6302 after injury also significantly improves scar appearance without reducing tissue strength in porcine injury models. PXS-6302 therefore represents a promising therapeutic to ameliorate scar formation, with potentially broader applications in other fibrotic diseases.",Scars are a significant problem caused by excess collagen in the skin. Here the authors develop a topical drug that reduces collagen stability and leads to improved scar appearance and stiffness in preclinical models.,2022-09-22
5,Cell Rover—a miniaturized magnetostrictive antenna for wireless operation inside living cells,"An intracellular antenna can open up new horizons for fundamental and applied biology. Here, we introduce the Cell Rover, a magnetostrictive antenna which can operate wirelessly inside a living cell and is compatible with 3D biological systems. It is sub-mm in size, acoustically actuated by an AC magnetic field and resonantly operated at low MHz frequencies, which is ideal for living systems. We developed an injection scheme involving non-uniform magnetic fields for intracellular injection of the Cell Rovers and demonstrated their operation in fully opaque, stage VI Xenopus oocytes, for which real-time imaging with conventional technologies is challenging. We also show that they provide a pathway for multiplexing applications to individually address multiple cells or to tune to more than one antenna within the same cell for versatile functionalities. This technology forms the foundation stone that can enable the integration of future capabilities such as smart sensing, modulation as well as energy harvesting to power in-cell nanoelectronic computing and can potentially bring the prowess of information technology inside a living cell. This could lead to unprecedented opportunities for fundamental understanding of biology as well as diagnostics and therapeutics.","An intracellular antenna that can truly enable probing, modulation or augmentation of biological cells remains an unmet challenge. Here, the authors present the Cell Rover, a magnetostrictive antenna that operates wirelessly inside a living cell and is compatible with 3D biological systems.",2022-09-22
6,High-throughput mutagenesis identifies mutations and RNA-binding proteins controlling CD19 splicing and CART-19 therapy resistance,"Following CART-19 immunotherapy for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), many patients relapse due to loss of the cognate CD19 epitope. Since epitope loss can be caused by aberrant CD19 exon 2 processing, we herein investigate the regulatory code that controls CD19 splicing. We combine high-throughput mutagenesis with mathematical modelling to quantitatively disentangle the effects of all mutations in the region comprising CD19 exons 1-3. Thereupon, we identify ~200 single point mutations that alter CD19 splicing and thus could predispose B-ALL patients to developing CART-19 resistance. Furthermore, we report almost 100 previously unknown splice isoforms that emerge from cryptic splice sites and likely encode non-functional CD19 proteins. We further identify cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins that control CD19 splicing (e.g., PTBP1 and SF3B4) and validate that loss of these factors leads to pervasive CD19 mis-splicing. Our dataset represents a comprehensive resource for identifying predictive biomarkers for CART-19 therapy.","Multiple alternative splicing events in CD19 mRNA have been associated with resistance/relapse to CD19 CAR-T therapy in patients with B cell malignancies. Here, by combining patient data and a high-throughput mutagenesis screen, the authors identify single point mutations and RNA-binding proteins that can control CD19 splicing and be associated with CD19 CAR-T therapy resistance.",2022-09-22
7,Context-dependent selectivity to natural images in the retina,"Retina ganglion cells extract specific features from natural scenes and send this information to the brain. In particular, they respond to local light increase (ON responses), and/or decrease (OFF). However, it is unclear if this ON-OFF selectivity, characterized with synthetic stimuli, is maintained under natural scene stimulation. Here we recorded ganglion cell responses to natural images slightly perturbed by random noise patterns to determine their selectivity during natural stimulation. The ON-OFF selectivity strongly depended on the specific image. A single ganglion cell can signal luminance increase for one image, and luminance decrease for another. Modeling and experiments showed that this resulted from the non-linear combination of different retinal pathways. Despite the versatility of the ON-OFF selectivity, a systematic analysis demonstrated that contrast was reliably encoded in these responses. Our perturbative approach uncovered the selectivity of retinal ganglion cells to more complex features than initially thought.","Ganglion cells classically respond to either light increase (ON) or decrease (OFF). Here, the authors show that during natural scene stimulation, a single ganglion cell can switch between ON and OFF depending on the visual context.",2022-09-22
8,High-temperature stability in air of Ti3C2Tx MXene-based composite with extracted bentonite,"Although Ti3C2Tx MXene is a promising material for many applications such as catalysis, energy storage, electromagnetic interference shielding due to its metallic conductivity and high processability, it’s poor resistance to oxidation at high temperatures makes its application under harsh environments challenging. Here, we report an air-stable Ti3C2Tx based composite with extracted bentonite (EB) nanosheets. In this case, oxygen molecules are shown to be preferentially adsorbed on EB. The saturated adsorption of oxygen on EB further inhibits more oxygen molecules to be adsorbed on the surface of Ti3C2Tx due to the weakened p-d orbital hybridization between adsorbed O2 and Ti3C2Tx, which is induced by the Ti3C2Tx/EB interface coupling. As a result, the composite is capable of tolerating high annealing temperatures (above 400 °C for several hours) both in air or humid environment, indicating highly improved antioxidation properties in harsh condition. The above finding is shown to be independent on the termination ratio of Ti3C2Tx obtained through different synthesis routes. Utilized as terahertz shielding materials, the composite retains its shielding ability after high-temperature treatment even up to 600 °C, while pristine Ti3C2Tx is completely oxidized with no terahertz shielding ability. Joule heating and thermal cycling performance are also demonstrated.","A major challenge for the effective use of Ti-based MXenes in applications with harsh environmental conditions is their poor resistance to oxidation. Here, authors report an air-stable Ti3C2Tx composite with extracted bentonite able to endure high-temperature annealing in air by an oxygen adsorption competition mechanism.",2022-09-22
9,Endocytosis-like DNA uptake by cell wall-deficient bacteria,"Horizontal gene transfer in bacteria is widely believed to occur via conjugation, transduction and transformation. These mechanisms facilitate the passage of DNA across the protective cell wall using sophisticated machinery. Here, we report that cell wall-deficient bacteria can engulf DNA and other extracellular material via an endocytosis-like process. Specifically, we show that L-forms of the filamentous actinomycete Kitasatospora viridifaciens can take up plasmid DNA, polysaccharides (dextran) and 150-nm lipid nanoparticles. The process involves invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane, leading to formation of intracellular vesicles that encapsulate extracellular material. DNA uptake is not affected by deletion of genes homologous to comEC and comEA, which are required for natural transformation in other species. However, uptake is inhibited by sodium azide or incubation at 4 °C, suggesting the process is energy-dependent. The encapsulated materials are released into the cytoplasm upon degradation of the vesicle membrane. Given that cell wall-deficient bacteria are considered a model for early life forms, our work reveals a possible mechanism for primordial cells to acquire food or genetic material before invention of the bacterial cell wall.","Horizontal gene transfer in bacteria can occur through mechanisms such as conjugation, transduction and transformation, which facilitate the passage of DNA across the cell wall. Here, Kapteijn et al. show that cell wall-deficient bacteria can take up DNA and other extracellular materials via an endocytosis-like process.",2022-09-22
10,Ambipolar blend-based organic electrochemical transistors and inverters,"CMOS-like circuits in bioelectronics translate biological to electronic signals using organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) based on organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs). Ambipolar OECTs can reduce the complexity of circuit fabrication, and in bioelectronics have the major advantage of detecting both cations and anions in one device, which further expands the prospects for diagnosis and sensing. Ambipolar OMIECs however, are scarce, limited by intricate materials design and complex synthesis. Here we demonstrate that judicious selection of p- and n-type materials for blend-based OMIECs offers a simple and tunable approach for the fabrication of ambipolar OECTs and corresponding circuits. These OECTs show high transconductance and excellent stability over multiple alternating polarity cycles, with ON/OFF ratios exceeding 103 and high gains in corresponding inverters. This work presents a simple and versatile new paradigm for the fabrication of ambipolar OMIECs and circuits with little constraints on materials design and synthesis and numerous possibilities for tunability and optimization towards higher performing bioelectronic applications.","Ambipolar organic electrochemical transistors simplify bioelectronics circuitry but are challenging due to complicated material design and synthesis. Here, the authors demonstrate that p- and n-type blends offer a simple and tuneable approach for the fabrication of ambipolar devices and circuits.",2022-09-22
11,Liquid-crystalline behavior on dumbbell-shaped colloids and the observation of chiral blue phases,"Colloidal liquid crystals are an emerging class of soft materials that naturally combine the unique properties of both liquid crystal molecules and colloidal particles. Chiral liquid crystal blue phases are attractive for use in fast optical displays and electrooptical devices, but the construction of blue phases is limited to a few chiral building blocks and the formation of blue phases from achiral ones is often counterintuitive. Herein we demonstrate that achiral dumbbell-shaped colloids can assemble into a rich variety of characteristic liquid crystal phases, including nematic phases with lock structures, smectic phase, and particularly experimental observation of blue phase III with double-twisted chiral columns. Phase diagrams from experiments and simulations show that the existence and stable regions of different liquid crystal phases are strongly dependent on the geometrical parameters of dumbbell-shaped colloids. This work paves a new route to the design and construction of blue phases for photonic applications.",Colloidal liquid crystals account for various applications due to the combination of characteristics relevant for liquid crystals and colloids. The authors elaborate the impact of concave geometry on the properties of colloidal liquid crystals for development of functional materials.,2022-09-22
12,Pauling-type adsorption of O2 induced electrocatalytic singlet oxygen production on N–CuO for organic pollutants degradation,"Due to environmentally friendly operation and on-site productivity, electrocatalytic singlet oxygen (1O2) production via O2 gas is of immense interest in environment purification. However, the side-on configuration of O2 on the catalysts surface will lead to the formation of H2O, which seriously limits the selectivity and activity of 1O2 production. Herein, we show a robust N-doped CuO (N–CuO) with Pauling-type (end-on) adsorption of O2 at the N–Cu–O3 sites for the selective generation of 1O2 under direct-current electric field. We propose that Pauling-type configuration of O2 not only lowers the overall activation energy barrier, but also alters the reaction pathway to form 1O2 instead of H2O, which is the key feature determining selectivity for the dissociation of Cu–O bonds rather than the O–O bonds. The proposed N dopant strategy is applicable to a series of transition metal oxides, providing a universal electrocatalysts design scheme for existing high-performance electrocatalytic 1O2 production.","Side-on configuration of O2 on the catalysts conventionally leads to reduction of O2 to water. Here, the authors propose a nitrogen doping strategy with Pauling-type adsorption of O2 for selective electrocatalytic singlet oxygen production.",2022-09-22
13,Ubiquitination of CLIP-170 family protein restrains polarized growth upon DNA replication stress,"Microtubules play a crucial role during the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. In fission yeast cells, the microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) (including the CLIP-170 homologue Tip1) regulate microtubule dynamics and also transport polarity factors to the cell cortex. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Dma1 plays an unexpected role in controlling polarized growth through ubiquitinating Tip1. Dma1 colocalizes with Tip1 to cortical sites at cell ends, and is required for ubiquitination of Tip1. Although the absence of dma1+ does not cause apparent polar growth defects in vegetatively growing cells, Dma1-mediated Tip1 ubiquitination is required to restrain polar growth upon DNA replication stress. This mechanism is distinct from the previously recognized calcineurin-dependent inhibition of polarized growth. In this work, we establish a link between Dma1-mediated Tip1 ubiquitination and DNA replication or DNA damage checkpoint-dependent inhibition of polarized growth in fission yeast.",The microtubule plus-end tracking protein Tip1 regulates microtubule dynamics and polar growth in fission yeast. Here the authors link the ubiquitination of Tip1 by ubiquitin ligase Dma1 to polarized growth inhibition upon DNA replication stress.,2022-09-22
14,Accelerating syngas-to-aromatic conversion via spontaneously monodispersed Fe in ZnCr2O4 spinel,"Spontaneous monodispersion of reducible active species (e.g., Fe, Co) and their stabilization in reductive atmospheres remain a key challenge in catalytic syngas chemistry. In this study, we present a series of catalysts including spontaneously monodispersed and enriched Fe on ZnCr2O4. Deep investigation shows remarkable performance in the syngas-to-aromatic reaction only when monodispersed Fe coupled with a H-ZSM-5 zeolite. Monodispersed Fe increases the turnover frequency from 0.14 to 0.48 s−1 without sacrificing the record high selectivity of total aromatics (80–90%) at a single pass. The increased activity is ascribed to more efficient activation of CO and H2 at oxygen vacancy nearest to the isolated Fe site and the prevention of carbide formation. Atomic precise characterization and theoretical calculations shed light on the origin and implications of spontaneous Fe monodispersion, which provide guidance to the design of next-generation catalyst for upgrading small molecules to synthetic fuels and chemicals.",Spontaneous monodispersion of active species and their stabilization in reductive atmospheres remain a challenge in catalytic syngas chemistry. Here the authors demonstrate that syngas-to-aromatic conversion can be significantly accelerated by the spontaneously monodispersed Fe in ZnCr2O4 spinel.,2022-09-22
15,A fungal tolerance trait and selective inhibitors proffer HMG-CoA reductase as a herbicide mode-of-action,"Decades of intense herbicide use has led to resistance in weeds. Without innovative weed management practices and new herbicidal modes of action, the unabated rise of herbicide resistance will undoubtedly place further stress upon food security. HMGR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase) is the rate limiting enzyme of the eukaryotic mevalonate pathway successfully targeted by statins to treat hypercholesterolemia in humans. As HMGR inhibitors have been shown to be herbicidal, HMGR could represent a mode of action target for the development of herbicides. Here, we present the crystal structure of a HMGR from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtHMG1) which exhibits a wider active site than previously determined structures from different species. This plant conserved feature enables the rational design of specific HMGR inhibitors and we develop a tolerance trait through sequence analysis of fungal gene clusters. These results suggest HMGR to be a viable herbicide target modifiable to provide a tolerance trait.","Managing herbicide resistance problem needs the identification of new herbicidal modes of action. Here, the authors solve the crystal structures of Arabidopsis HMGR and show HMGR as a potential new herbicide target by identifying plant-specific HMGR inhibitors and engineering tolerant trait in Arabidopsis.",2022-09-22
16,Excitonic Bloch–Siegert shift in CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots,"Coherent interaction between matter and light field induces both optical Stark effect and Bloch–Siegert shift. Observing the latter has been historically challenging, because it is weak and is often accompanied by a much stronger Stark shift. Herein, by controlling the light helicity, we can largely restrict these two effects to different spin-transitions in CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots, achieving room-temperature Bloch–Siegert shift as strong as 4 meV with near-infrared pulses. The ratio between the Bloch–Siegert and optical Stark shifts is however systematically higher than the prediction by the non-interacting, quasi-particle model. With a model that explicitly accounts for excitonic effects, we quantitatively reproduce the experimental observations. This model depicts a unified physical picture of the optical Stark effect, biexcitonic optical Stark effect and Bloch–Siegert shift in low-dimensional materials displaying strong many-body interactions, forming the basis for the implementation of these effects to information processing, optical modulation and Floquet engineering.","Observation of a Bloch-Siegert shift has remained elusive. Here, Wu et al, reports spin-selective Bloch-Siegert shift in lead halide perovskite quantum dots, and highlights the importance of many-body interactions in correctly modeling the shift.",2022-09-22
17,Chromatin organizer SATB1 controls the cell identity of CD4+ CD8+ double-positive thymocytes by regulating the activity of super-enhancers,"CD4+ and CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes play a crucial role in T cell development in the thymus. DP cells rearrange the T cell receptor gene Tcra to generate T cell receptors with TCRβ. DP cells differentiate into CD4 or CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes, regulatory T cells, or invariant nature kill T cells (iNKT) in response to TCR signaling. Chromatin organizer SATB1 is highly expressed in DP cells and is essential in regulating Tcra rearrangement and differentiation of DP cells. Here we explored the mechanism of SATB1 orchestrating gene expression in DP cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing shows that Satb1 deletion changes the cell identity of DP thymocytes and down-regulates genes specifically and highly expressed in DP cells. Super-enhancers regulate the expressions of DP-specific genes, and our Hi-C data show that SATB1 deficiency in thymocytes reduces super-enhancer activity by specifically decreasing interactions among super-enhancers and between super-enhancers and promoters. Our results reveal that SATB1 plays a critical role in thymocyte development to promote the establishment of DP cell identity by globally regulating super-enhancers of DP cells at the chromatin architectural level.","Here the authors show the identity of CD4 + CD8 + double-positive (DP) thymocytes changes upon loss of chromatin organizer Satb1, which controls the expression of cell identity genes by regulating super-enhancers via 3D genome architecture.",2022-09-22
18,Scalable anisotropic cooling aerogels by additive freeze-casting,"Cooling in buildings is vital to human well-being but inevitability consumes significant energy, adding pressure on achieving carbon neutrality. Thermally superinsulating aerogels are promising to isolate the heat for more energy-efficient cooling. However, most aerogels tend to absorb the sunlight for unwanted solar heat gain, and it is challenging to scale up the aerogel fabrication while maintaining consistent properties. Herein, we develop a thermally insulating, solar-reflective anisotropic cooling aerogel panel containing in-plane aligned pores with engineered pore walls using boron nitride nanosheets by an additive freeze-casting technique. The additive freeze-casting offers highly controllable and cumulative freezing dynamics for fabricating decimeter-scale aerogel panels with consistent in-plane pore alignments. The unique anisotropic thermo-optical properties of the nanosheets combined with in-plane pore channels enable the anisotropic cooling aerogel to deliver an ultralow out-of-plane thermal conductivity of 16.9 mW m−1 K−1 and a high solar reflectance of 97%. The excellent dual functionalities allow the anisotropic cooling aerogel to minimize both parasitic and solar heat gains when used as cooling panels under direct sunlight, achieving an up to 7 °C lower interior temperature than commercial silica aerogels. This work offers a new paradigm for the bottom-up fabrication of scalable anisotropic aerogels towards practical energy-efficient cooling applications.","Scaling up anisotropic freeze-casting processes can be challenging due to the temperature gradient farther from the cold source. Here, authors report an additive freeze-casting technique able to produce large-scale aerogel panels and demonstrate it towards practical passive cooling applications.",2022-09-22
19,60 million years of glaciation in the Transantarctic Mountains,"The Antarctic continent reached its current polar location ~83 Ma and became shrouded by ice sheets ~34 Ma, coincident with dramatic global cooling at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. However, it is not known whether the first Antarctic glaciers formed immediately prior to this or were present significantly earlier. Here we show that mountain glaciers were likely present in the Transantarctic Mountains during the Late Palaeocene (~60–56 Ma) and middle Eocene (~48–40 Ma). Temperate (warm-based) glaciers were prevalent during the Late Eocene (~40–34 Ma) and, in reduced numbers, during the Oligocene (~34–23 Ma), before larger, likely cold-based, ice masses (including ice sheets) dominated. Some temperate mountain glaciers were present during the Miocene Climatic Optimum (~15 Ma), before a widespread switch to cold-based glaciation. Our findings highlight the longevity of glaciation in Antarctica and suggest that glaciers were present even during the Early-Cenozoic greenhouse world.","This study finds that glaciers have existed in the Transantarctic Mountains for the past 60 million years, and that warm-based mountain glaciers were present in Antarctica long before ice sheets came to dominate the continent.",2022-09-21
20,"Enantioselective nickel-catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of 3,3,3-trifluoropropene","Despite paramount applications of chiral trifluoromethylated compounds in medicinal chemistry and materials science, limited strategies have been developed for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of such valuable fluorinated structures. Here, we report a nickel catalyzed enantioselective dicarbofunctionalization of inexpensive industrial chemical 3,3,3-trifluoropropene (TFP) with readily available tertiary alkyl and aryl iodides. The reaction overcomes the β-F elimination side reaction of TFP, and proceeds efficiently under mild reaction conditions. The protocol possesses advantages, such as synthetic convenience, high enantioselectivity, and excellent functional group tolerance, providing rapid and straightforward access to chiral trifluoromethylated compounds of medicinal interest.","Strategies for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of trifluoromethylated compounds remain scarce. Here, the authors report the nickel-catalyzed enantioselective dicarbofunctionalization of 3,3,3-trifluoropropene.",2022-09-21
21,Preclinical and randomized clinical evaluation of the p38α kinase inhibitor neflamapimod for basal forebrain cholinergic degeneration,"The endosome-associated GTPase Rab5 is a central player in the molecular mechanisms leading to degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN), a long-standing target for drug development. As p38α is a Rab5 activator, we hypothesized that inhibition of this kinase holds potential as an approach to treat diseases associated with BFCN loss. Herein, we report that neflamapimod (oral small molecule p38α inhibitor) reduces Rab5 activity, reverses endosomal pathology, and restores the numbers and morphology of BFCNs in a mouse model that develops BFCN degeneration. We also report on the results of an exploratory (hypothesis-generating) phase 2a randomized double-blind 16-week placebo-controlled clinical trial (Clinical trial registration: NCT04001517/EudraCT #2019-001566-15) of neflamapimod in mild-to-moderate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a disease in which BFCN degeneration is an important driver of disease expression. A total of 91 participants, all receiving background cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, were randomized 1:1 between neflamapimod 40 mg or matching placebo capsules (taken orally twice-daily if weight <80 kg or thrice-daily if weight >80 kg). Neflamapimod does not show an effect in the clinical study on the primary endpoint, a cognitive-test battery. On two secondary endpoints, a measure of functional mobility and a dementia rating-scale, improvements were seen that are consistent with an effect on BFCN function. Neflamapimod treatment is well-tolerated with no study drug associated treatment discontinuations. The combined preclinical and clinical observations inform on the validity of the Rab5-based pathogenic model of cholinergic degeneration and provide a foundation for confirmatory (hypothesis-testing) clinical evaluation of neflamapimod in DLB.","The authors show in an animal model and in a study in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) that the drug neflamapimod has potential to treat diseases, such as DLB, associated with loss of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.",2022-09-21
22,Insular cortical circuits as an executive gateway to decipher threat or extinction memory via distinct subcortical pathways,"Threat and extinction memories are crucial for organisms’ survival in changing environments. These memories are believed to be encoded by separate ensembles of neurons in the brain, but their whereabouts remain elusive. Using an auditory fear-conditioning and extinction paradigm in male mice, here we discovered that two distinct projection neuron subpopulations in physical proximity within the insular cortex (IC), targeting the central amygdala (CeA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), respectively, to encode fear and extinction memories. Reciprocal intracortical inhibition of these two IC subpopulations gates the emergence of either fear or extinction memory. Using rabies-virus-assisted tracing, we found IC-NAc projection neurons to be preferentially innervated by intercortical inputs from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), specifically enhancing extinction to override fear memory. These results demonstrate that IC serves as an operation node harboring distinct projection neurons that decipher fear or extinction memory under the top-down executive control from OFC.",Ensembles of fear and extinction memories compete and interact to drive opposing behaviors. Here the authors identified insular cortical circuits as an executive gateway that decipher between fear and extinction memories via distinct subcortical pathways.,2022-09-21
23,Leaf water content contributes to global leaf trait relationships,"Leaf functional traits are important indicators of plant growth and ecosystem dynamics. Despite a wealth of knowledge about leaf trait relationships, a mechanistic understanding of how biotic and abiotic factors quantitatively influence leaf trait variation and scaling is still incomplete. We propose that leaf water content (LWC) inherently affects other leaf traits, although its role has been largely neglected. Here, we present a modification of a previously validated model based on metabolic theory and use an extensive global leaf trait dataset to test it. Analyses show that mass-based photosynthetic capacity and specific leaf area increase nonlinearly with LWC, as predicted by the model. When the effects of temperature and LWC are controlled, the numerical values for the leaf area-mass scaling exponents converge onto 1.0 across plant functional groups, ecosystem types, and latitudinal zones. The data also indicate that leaf water mass is a better predictor of whole-leaf photosynthesis and leaf area than whole-leaf nitrogen and phosphorus masses. Our findings highlight a comprehensive theory that can quantitatively predict some global patterns from the leaf economics spectrum.","Leaf functional traits are increasingly used as proxies for plant functions. Here, the authors show that leaf water affects other leaf traits and is a better predictor of whole-leaf photosynthesis and leaf area than leaf nitrogen or phosphorus content.",2022-09-21
24,VAL1 acts as an assembly platform co-ordinating co-transcriptional repression and chromatin regulation at Arabidopsis FLC,"Polycomb (PcG) silencing is crucial for development, but how targets are specified remains incompletely understood. The cold-induced Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) silencing of Arabidopsis thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) provides an excellent system to elucidate PcG regulation. Association of the DNA binding protein VAL1 to FLC PcG nucleation regionis an important step. VAL1 co-immunoprecipitates APOPTOSIS AND SPLICING ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (ASAP) complex and PRC1. Here, we show that ASAP and PRC1 are necessary for co-transcriptional repression and chromatin regulation at FLC. ASAP mutants affect FLC transcription in warm conditions, but the rate of FLC silencing in the cold is unaffected. PRC1-mediated H2Aub accumulation increases at the FLC nucleation region during cold, but unlike the PRC2-delivered H3K27me3, does not spread across the locus. H2Aub thus involved in the transition to epigenetic silencing at FLC, facilitating H3K27me3 accumulation and long-term epigenetic memory. Overall, our work highlights the importance of VAL1 as an assembly platform co-ordinating activities necessary for epigenetic silencing at FLC.","Cold-induced silencing of Arabidopsis FLC requires the binding of VAL1 to an intronic motif. Here, the authors show that ASAP and PRC1, two interacting partner complexes of VAL1, mediate co-transcriptional repression and chromatin modulation to effectively co-ordinate different steps in FLC silencing.",2022-09-21
25,Repeating fast radio burst 20201124A originates from a magnetar/Be star binary,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are cosmic sources emitting millisecond-duration radio bursts. Although several hundreds FRBs have been discovered, their physical nature and central engine remain unclear. The variations of Faraday rotation measure and dispersion measure, due to local environment, are crucial clues to understanding their physical nature. The recent observations on the rotation measure of FRB 20201124A show a significant variation on a day time scale. Intriguingly, the oscillation of rotation measure supports that the local contribution can change sign, which indicates the magnetic field reversal along the line of sight. Here we present a physical model that explains observed characteristics of FRB 20201124A and proposes that repeating signal comes from a binary system containing a magnetar and a Be star with a decretion disk. When the magnetar approaches the periastron, the propagation of radio waves through the disk of the Be star naturally leads to the observed varying rotation measure, depolarization, large scattering timescale, and Faraday conversion. This study will prompt to search for FRB signals from Be/X-ray binaries.","Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond or shorter duration transient events. Here, the authors propose that FRB 20201124A comes from a binary system of a magnetar and a Be star with a decretion disk.",2022-09-21
26,Transcriptomic architecture of nuclei in the marmoset CNS,"To understand the cellular composition and region-specific specialization of white matter — a disease-relevant, glia-rich tissue highly expanded in primates relative to rodents — we profiled transcriptomes of ~500,000 nuclei from 19 tissue types of the central nervous system of healthy common marmoset and mapped 87 subclusters spatially onto a 3D MRI atlas. We performed cross-species comparison, explored regulatory pathways, modeled regional intercellular communication, and surveyed cellular determinants of neurological disorders. Here, we analyze this resource and find strong spatial segregation of microglia, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and astrocytes. White matter glia are diverse, enriched with genes involved in stimulus-response and biomolecule modification, and predicted to interact with other resident cells more extensively than their gray matter counterparts. Conversely, gray matter glia preserve the expression of neural tube patterning genes into adulthood and share six transcription factors that restrict transcriptome complexity. A companion Callithrix jacchus Primate Cell Atlas (CjPCA) is available through https://cjpca.ninds.nih.gov.","Studies of cell heterogeneity in white matter in primates have been limited to date. Here the authors describe a marmoset brain cell atlas that bridges rodent and human data, revealing strong gray-white matter glial segregation.",2022-09-21
27,Neural probe system for behavioral neuropharmacology by bi-directional wireless drug delivery and electrophysiology in socially interacting mice,"Assessing the neurological and behavioral effects of drugs is important in developing pharmacological treatments, as well as understanding the mechanisms associated with neurological disorders. Herein, we present a miniaturized, wireless neural probe system with the capability of delivering drugs for the real-time investigation of the effects of the drugs on both behavioral and neural activities in socially interacting mice. We demonstrate wireless drug delivery and simultaneous monitoring of the resulting neural, behavioral changes, as well as the dose-dependent and repeatable responses to drugs. Furthermore, in pairs of mice, we use a food competition assay in which social interaction was modulated by the delivery of the drug, and the resulting changes in their neural activities are analyzed. During modulated food competition by drug injection, we observe changes in neural activity in mPFC region of a participating mouse over time. Our system may provide new opportunities for the development of studying the effects of drugs on behaviour and neural activity.",Technologies for monitoring electrophysiological effects of drugs in behaving animals have limitations. Here the authors report a wireless neural probe system with drug delivery capability for real-time monitoring of drug effects.,2022-09-21
28,Reaction-based fluorogenic probes for detecting protein cysteine oxidation in living cells,"‘Turn-on’ fluorescence probes for detecting H2O2 in cells are established, but equivalent tools to monitor the products of its reaction with protein cysteines have not been reported. Here we describe fluorogenic probes for detecting sulfenic acid, a redox modification inextricably linked to H2O2 signaling and oxidative stress. The reagents exhibit excellent cell permeability, rapid reactivity, and high selectivity with minimal cytotoxicity. We develop a high-throughput assay for measuring S-sulfenation in cells and use it to screen a curated kinase inhibitor library. We reveal a positive association between S-sulfenation and inhibition of TK, AGC, and CMGC kinase group members including GSK3, a promising target for neurological disorders. Proteomic mapping of GSK3 inhibitor-treated cells shows that S-sulfenation sites localize to the regulatory cysteines of antioxidant enzymes. Our studies highlight the ability of kinase inhibitors to modulate the cysteine sulfenome and should find broad application in the rapidly growing field of redox medicine.","Fluorogenic detection of H2O2 in cells is established, but equivalent tools to monitor its cellular targets remain in their infancy. Here authors develop fluorogenic probes for detecting cysteine sulfenic acid, a redox modification inextricably linked to H2O2 signalling and oxidative stress.",2022-09-21
29,The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 spike G446S mutation potentiates antiviral T-cell recognition,"Although the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus shows resistance to neutralizing antibody, it retains susceptibility to the cellular immune response. Here we characterize vaccine-induced T cells specific for various SARS-CoV-2 variants and identified HLA-A*24:02-restricted CD8+ T cells that strongly suppress Omicron BA.1 replication in vitro. Mutagenesis analyses revealed that a G446S mutation, located just outside the N-terminus of the cognate epitope, augmented TCR recognition of this variant. In contrast, no enhanced suppression of replication is observed against cells infected with the prototype, Omicron BA.2, and Delta variants that express G446. The enhancing effect of the G446S mutation is lost when target cells are treated with inhibitors of tripeptidyl peptidase II, a protein that mediates antigen processing. These ex vivo analysis and in vitro results demonstrate that the G446S mutation in the Omicron BA.1 variant affects antigen processing/presentation and potentiates antiviral activity by vaccine-induced T cells, leading to enhanced T cell recognition towards emerging variants.",Mutations in the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can result in the escape of the neutralising antibody response but may retain susceptibility to the cellular immune response. Here the authors show the G446S mutation in the spike protein of Omicron BA.1 is associated with altered antigen presentation and potentiates activation of specific T cell immunity.,2022-09-21
30,Observation of spin-glass-like characteristics in ferrimagnetic TbCo through energy-level-selective approach,"Rare earth (RE)–transition metal (TM) ferrimagnetic alloys are gaining increasing attention because of their potential use in the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics. The moment from RE sub-lattice primarily originates from the 4f-electrons located far below the Fermi level (EF), and the moment from TM sub-lattice arises from the 3d-electrons across the EF. Therefore, the individual magnetic moment configurations at different energy levels must be explored to clarify the microscopic mechanism of antiferromagnetic spin dynamics. Considering these issues, here we investigate the energy-level-selective magnetic moment configuration in ferrimagnetic TbCo alloy. We reveal that magnetic moments at deeper energy levels are more easily altered by the external magnetic field than those near the EF. More importantly, we find that the magnetic moments at deeper energy levels exhibit a spin-glass-like characteristics such as slow dynamics and magnetic moment freezing whereas those at EF do not. These unique energy-level-dependent characteristics of RE-TM ferrimagnet may provide a better understanding of ferrimagnet, which could be useful in spintronic applications as well as in spin-glass studies.","In a ferrimagnet, there are two magnetic sublattices coupled antiferromagnetically. The dynamics of the two magnetic sublattices isn’t well understood, as the magnetic moments for each reside at different energy levels. Here, Park et al show that the magnetic moments at deeper energy levels show spin-glass like characteristics.",2022-09-21
31,Differential dysregulation of granule subsets in WASH-deficient neutrophil leukocytes resulting in inflammation,"Dysregulated secretion in neutrophil leukocytes associates with human inflammatory disease. The exocytosis response to triggering stimuli is sequential; gelatinase granules modulate the initiation of the innate immune response, followed by the release of pro-inflammatory azurophilic granules, requiring stronger stimulation. Exocytosis requires actin depolymerization which is actively counteracted under non-stimulatory conditions. Here we show that the actin nucleator, WASH, is necessary to maintain azurophilic granules in their refractory state by granule actin entrapment and interference with the Rab27a-JFC1 exocytic machinery. On the contrary, gelatinase granules of WASH-deficient neutrophil leukocytes are characterized by decreased Rac1, shortened granule-associated actin comets and impaired exocytosis. Rac1 activation restores exocytosis of these granules. In vivo, WASH deficiency induces exacerbated azurophilic granule exocytosis, inflammation, and decreased survival. WASH deficiency thus differentially impacts neutrophil granule subtypes, impairing exocytosis of granules that mediate the initiation of the neutrophil innate response while exacerbating pro-inflammatory granule secretion.","Responsive exocytosis in neutrophil leukocytes involves actin depolymerisation-dependent sequential release of gelatinase granules, then strongly pro-inflammatory azurophilic granules. Here authors show that the actin nucleator protein WASH facilitates the initial step of innate immune activation by gelatinase granules while inhibiting release of pro-inflammatory granules.",2022-09-21
32,Multi-omic brain and behavioral correlates of cell-free fetal DNA methylation in macaque maternal obesity models,"Maternal obesity during pregnancy is associated with neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk. We utilized integrative multi-omics to examine maternal obesity effects on offspring neurodevelopment in rhesus macaques by comparison to lean controls and two interventions. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from longitudinal maternal blood-derived cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) significantly overlapped with DMRs from infant brain. The DMRs were enriched for neurodevelopmental functions, methylation-sensitive developmental transcription factor motifs, and human NDD DMRs identified from brain and placenta. Brain and cffDNA methylation levels from a large region overlapping mir-663 correlated with maternal obesity, metabolic and immune markers, and infant behavior. A DUX4 hippocampal co-methylation network correlated with maternal obesity, infant behavior, infant hippocampal lipidomic and metabolomic profiles, and maternal blood measurements of DUX4 cffDNA methylation, cytokines, and metabolites. We conclude that in this model, maternal obesity was associated with changes in the infant brain and behavior, and these differences were detectable in pregnancy through integrative analyses of cffDNA methylation with immune and metabolic factors.","In animal models, maternal obesity is associated with development of neurodevelopmental disorder like phenotypes. Here the authors show in a macaque model that in obese dams, cell-free fetal DNA methylation, inflammatory cytokines, and metabolites correlated with infant brain DNA methylation, lipids, and metabolites.",2022-09-21
33,Sustainable production of hydrogen with high purity from methanol and water at low temperatures,"Carbon neutrality initiative has stimulated the development of the sustainable methodologies for hydrogen generation and safe storage. Aqueous-phase reforming methanol and H2O (APRM) has attracted the particular interests for their high gravimetric density and easy availability. Thus, to efficiently release hydrogen and significantly suppress CO generation at low temperatures without any additives is the sustainable pursuit of APRM. Herein, we demonstrate that the dual-active sites of Pt single-atoms and frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) on porous nanorods of CeO2 enable the efficient additive-free H2 generation with a low CO (0.027%) through APRM at 120 °C. Mechanism investigations illustrate that the Pt single-atoms and Lewis acidic sites cooperatively promote the activation of methanol. With the help of a spontaneous water dissociation on FLPs, Pt single-atoms exhibit a significantly improved reforming of *CO to promote H2 production and suppress CO generation. This finding provides a promising path towards the flexible hydrogen utilizations.",Carbon neutrality initiative has stimulated the development of the sustainable methodologies for hydrogen generation and safe storage. Here the authors demonstrate that the dual-active sites of Pt single-atoms and frustrated Lewis pairs on porous nanorods of CeO2 enable the efficient additive-free H2 generation with a low CO generation through reforming of methanol and water.,2022-09-21
34,Magnitude of venous or capillary blood-derived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response determines COVID-19 immunity,"T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 are thought to protect against infection and development of COVID-19, but direct evidence for this is lacking. Here, we associated whole-blood-based measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon-γ-positive T cell responses with positive COVID-19 diagnostic (PCR and/or lateral flow) test results up to 6 months post-blood sampling. Amongst 148 participants donating venous blood samples, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response magnitude is significantly greater in those who remain protected versus those who become infected (P < 0.0001); relatively low magnitude T cell response results in a 43.2% risk of infection, whereas high magnitude reduces this risk to 5.4%. These findings are recapitulated in a further 299 participants testing a scalable capillary blood-based assay that could facilitate the acquisition of population-scale T cell immunity data (14.9% and 4.4%, respectively). Hence, measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells can prognosticate infection risk and should be assessed when monitoring individual and population immunity status.","The presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies alone is not an accurate determinant of immunity. In this work, the authors investigate if whole-blood based measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses could prognosticate the risk of possible SARS-CoV-2 infection, and recapitulate their findings in a capillary blood-based assay.",2022-09-21
35,A de novo matrix for macroscopic living materials from bacteria,"Engineered living materials (ELMs) embed living cells in a biopolymer matrix to create materials with tailored functions. While bottom-up assembly of macroscopic ELMs with a de novo matrix would offer the greatest control over material properties, we lack the ability to genetically encode a protein matrix that leads to collective self-organization. Here we report growth of ELMs from Caulobacter crescentus cells that display and secrete a self-interacting protein. This protein formed a de novo matrix and assembled cells into centimeter-scale ELMs. Discovery of design and assembly principles allowed us to tune the composition, mechanical properties, and catalytic function of these ELMs. This work provides genetic tools, design and assembly rules, and a platform for growing ELMs with control over both matrix and cellular structure and function.","Engineered living materials (ELMs) embed living cells in a biopolymer matrix to create novel materials with tailored functions. In this work, the authors engineered bacteria to grow novel macroscopic materials that can be reshaped, functionalized, and used to filter contaminated water while also showing that the stiffness of these materials can be tuned through genetic changes.",2022-09-21
36,Characterizing DNA methylation signatures of retinoblastoma using aqueous humor liquid biopsy,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is a cancer that forms in the developing retina of babies and toddlers. The goal of therapy is to cure the tumor, save the eye and maximize vision. However, it is difficult to predict which eyes are likely to respond to therapy. Predictive molecular biomarkers are needed to guide prognosis and optimize treatment decisions. Direct tumor biopsy is not an option for this cancer; however, the aqueous humor (AH) is an alternate source of tumor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Here we show that DNA methylation profiling of the AH is a valid method to identify the methylation status of RB tumors. We identify 294 genes directly regulated by methylation that are implicated in p53 tumor suppressor (RB1, p53, p21, and p16) and oncogenic (E2F) pathways. Finally, we use AH to characterize molecular subtypes that can potentially be used to predict the likelihood of treatment success for retinoblastoma patients.","Retinoblastoma response to treatment is difficult to predict. Here, the authors show that DNA methylation of cfDNA from aqueous humour is altered in retinoblastoma patients and can be used to identify the molecular subtypes and potentially predict treatment response.",2022-09-21
37,Evolutionary origin of vertebrate OCT4/POU5 functions in supporting pluripotency,"The support of pluripotent cells over time is an essential feature of development. In eutherian embryos, pluripotency is maintained from naïve states in peri-implantation to primed pluripotency at gastrulation. To understand how these states emerged, we reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of the Pou5 gene family, which contains the central pluripotency factor OCT4. By coupling evolutionary sequence analysis with functional studies in mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that the ability of POU5 proteins to support pluripotency originated in the gnathostome lineage, prior to the generation of two paralogues, Pou5f1 and Pou5f3 via gene duplication. In osteichthyans, retaining both genes, the paralogues differ in their support of naïve and primed pluripotency. The specialization of these duplicates enables the diversification of function in self-renewal and differentiation. By integrating sequence evolution, cell phenotypes, developmental contexts and structural modelling, we pinpoint OCT4 regions sufficient for naïve pluripotency and describe their adaptation over evolutionary time.","By constructing an evolutionary trajectory of the cyclostome-gnathostome Pou5 gene family and comparing the structural and phenotypic protein variations, the authors uncover the origin of functional characteristics for the pluripotency factor Oct4.",2022-09-21
38,Mechanism driven design of trimer Ni1Sb2 site delivering superior hydrogenation selectivity to ethylene,"Mechanism driven catalyst design with atomically uniform ensemble sites is an important yet challenging issue in heterogeneous catalysis associated with breaking the activity-selectivity trade-off. Herein, a trimer Ni1Sb2 site in NiSb intermetallic featuring superior selectivity is elaborated for acetylene semi-hydrogenation via a theoretical guidance with a precise synthesis strategy. The trimer Ni1Sb2 site in NiSb intermetallic is predicted to endow acetylene reactant with an adequately but not excessively strong σ-adsorption mode while ethylene product with a weak π-adsorption one, where such compromise delivers higher ethylene formation rate. An in-situ trapping of molten Sb by Ni strategy is developed to realize the construction of Ni1Sb2 site in the intermetallic P63/mmc NiSb catalysts. Such catalyst exhibits ethylene selectivity up to 93.2% at 100% of acetylene conversion, significantly prevailing over the referred Ni catalyst. These insights shed new lights on rational catalyst design by taming active sites to energetically match targeted reaction pathway.","Designing atomically uniform ensemble sites for matching targeted reaction pathway is important yet challenging in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, the authors fabricate a trimer Ni1Sb2 site featuring superior selectivity for acetylene semi-hydrogenation via a mechanism-driven design strategy.",2022-09-21
39,The role of renewables for rapid transitioning of the power sector across states in India,"Recent events like heatwaves and abnormal rainfall are a glimpse of the devastating effects of human induced climate change. No country is immune to its effects, but a developing country like India is particularly vulnerable. This research, for the individual states of India, explores the technical feasibility and economic viability of a renewable transition pathway for the power sector. Based on the assumptions of this study, we show that a renewables-based power system by 2050 is lower in cost than the current  coal dominated system, has zero greenhouse gas emissions and provides reliable electricity to around 1.7 billion people. Electricity generation will be based on solar PV, wind energy, and hydropower, while batteries and multi-fuel reciprocating internal combustion engines based on synthetic fuels provide the required flexibility to the power system. This transition would address  multiple imperatives: affordability, accessibility, and sustainability without compromising economic growth.","A new study assesses the feasibility of a fully renewable based power system by 2050 across India, finding this option to be cost competitive with the status quo and with zero GHG emissions.",2022-09-21
40,Intrinsic bias estimation for improved analysis of bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles using SELMA,"Genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility by DNase-seq or ATAC-seq has been widely used to identify regulatory DNA elements and transcription factor binding sites. However, enzymatic DNA cleavage exhibits intrinsic sequence biases that confound chromatin accessibility profiling data analysis. Existing computational tools are limited in their ability to account for such intrinsic biases and not designed for analyzing single-cell data. Here, we present Simplex Encoded Linear Model for Accessible Chromatin (SELMA), a computational method for systematic estimation of intrinsic cleavage biases from genomic chromatin accessibility profiling data. We demonstrate that SELMA yields accurate and robust bias estimation from both bulk and single-cell DNase-seq and ATAC-seq data. SELMA can utilize internal mitochondrial DNA data to improve bias estimation. We show that transcription factor binding inference from DNase footprints can be improved by incorporating estimated biases using SELMA. Furthermore, we show strong effects of intrinsic biases in single-cell ATAC-seq data, and develop the first single-cell ATAC-seq intrinsic bias correction model to improve cell clustering. SELMA can enhance the performance of existing bioinformatics tools and improve the analysis of both bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing data.","Genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility by DNase-seq or ATAC-seq has been widely used to identify regulatory DNA elements and transcription factor binding sites.

41,Atomistic deformation mechanism of silicon under laser-driven shock compression,"Silicon (Si) is one of the most abundant elements on Earth, and it is the most widely used semiconductor. Despite extensive study, some properties of Si, such as its behaviour under dynamic compression, remain elusive. A detailed understanding of Si deformation is crucial for various fields, ranging from planetary science to materials design. Simulations suggest that in Si the shear stress generated during shock compression is released via a high-pressure phase transition, challenging the classical picture of relaxation via defect-mediated plasticity. However, direct evidence supporting either deformation mechanism remains elusive. Here, we use sub-picosecond, highly-monochromatic x-ray diffraction to study (100)-oriented single-crystal Si under laser-driven shock compression. We provide the first unambiguous, time-resolved picture of Si deformation at ultra-high strain rates, demonstrating the predicted shear release via phase transition. Our results resolve the longstanding controversy on silicon deformation and provide direct proof of strain rate-dependent deformation mechanisms in a non-metallic system.","Understanding the how silicon deforms under pressure is important for several fields, including planetary science and materials design. Laser-driven shock compression experiments now confirm that shear stress generated during compression is released via a high-pressure phase transition.",2022-09-21
42,Resolving molecular diffusion and aggregation of antibody proteins with megahertz X-ray free-electron laser pulses,"X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) with megahertz repetition rate can provide novel insights into structural dynamics of biological macromolecule solutions. However, very high dose rates can lead to beam-induced dynamics and structural changes due to radiation damage. Here, we probe the dynamics of dense antibody protein (Ig-PEG) solutions using megahertz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European XFEL. By varying the total dose and dose rate, we identify a regime for measuring the motion of proteins in their first coordination shell, quantify XFEL-induced effects such as driven motion, and map out the extent of agglomeration dynamics. The results indicate that for average dose rates below 1.06 kGy μs−1 in a time window up to 10 μs, it is possible to capture the protein dynamics before the onset of beam induced aggregation. We refer to this approach as correlation before aggregation and demonstrate that MHz-XPCS bridges an important spatio-temporal gap in measurement techniques for biological samples.","The European X-ray FreeElectron Laser Facility generates ultrashort hard X-ray pulses with megahertz repetition rate. Here, the authors probe the dynamics of dense antibody protein (Ig-PEG) solutions using megahertz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy at the European XFEL.",2022-09-21
43,Metabolic pathway assembly using docking domains from type I cis-AT polyketide synthases,"Engineered metabolic pathways in microbial cell factories often have no natural organization and have challenging flux imbalances, leading to low biocatalytic efficiency. Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are multienzyme complexes that synthesize polyketide products via an assembly line thiotemplate mechanism. Here, we develop a strategy named mimic PKS enzyme assembly line (mPKSeal) that assembles key cascade enzymes to enhance biocatalytic efficiency and increase target production by recruiting cascade enzymes tagged with docking domains from type I cis-AT PKS. We apply this strategy to the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway in engineered Escherichia coli for multienzyme assembly to increase astaxanthin production by 2.4-fold. The docking pairs, from the same PKSs or those from different cis-AT PKSs evidently belonging to distinct classes, are effective enzyme assembly tools for increasing astaxanthin production. This study addresses the challenge of cascade catalytic efficiency and highlights the potential for engineering enzyme assembly.","Assembly artificial pathway in design connecting media can increase biosynthetic efficiency, but the choice of connecting media is limited.

44,Structural materials with afterglow room temperature phosphorescence activated by lignin oxidation,"Sustainable afterglow room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, especially afterglow RTP structural materials, are crucial but remain difficult to achieve. Here, an oxidation strategy is developed to convert lignin to afterglow materials with a lifetime of ~ 408 ms. Specifically, lignin is oxidized to give aromatic chromophores and fatty acids using H2O2. The aromatic chromophores are locked by a fatty acid-based matrix by hydrogen bonds, triggering enhanced spin orbit coupling and long afterglow emission. More interestingly, motivated by this discovery, an auto fabrication line is built to convert wood (natural structural materials) to wood with afterglow RTP emission (RTP wood) via in situ oxidation of naturally-occurring lignin located in the wood cell walls to oxidized lignin (OL). The as-prepared RTP wood exhibits great potential for the construction of sustainable afterglow furniture. With this research we provide a new strategy to promote the sustainability of afterglow RTP materials and structural materials.","Sustainable afterglow room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) Structural materials are difficult to achieve. Here, the authors demonstrate a wood based RTP material by oxidation of lignin to realize an afterglow RTP material with a lifetime of ~ 408 ms.",2022-09-20
45,Adar-mediated A-to-I editing is required for embryonic patterning and innate immune response regulation in zebrafish,"Adenosine deaminases (ADARs) catalyze the deamination of adenosine to inosine, also known as A-to-I editing, in RNA. Although A-to-I editing occurs widely across animals and is well studied, new biological roles are still being discovered. Here, we study the role of A-to-I editing in early zebrafish development. We demonstrate that Adar, the zebrafish orthologue of mammalian ADAR1, is essential for establishing the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes and patterning. Genome-wide editing discovery reveals pervasive editing in maternal and the earliest zygotic transcripts, the majority of which occurred in the 3’-UTR. Interestingly, transcripts implicated in gastrulation as well as dorso-ventral and antero-posterior patterning are found to contain multiple editing sites. Adar knockdown or overexpression affect gene expression by 12 hpf. Analysis of adar-/- zygotic mutants further reveals that the previously described role of Adar in mammals in regulating the innate immune response is conserved in zebrafish. Our study therefore establishes distinct maternal and zygotic functions of RNA editing by Adar in embryonic patterning along the zebrafish antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes, and in the regulation of the innate immune response, respectively.","Additional roles for A-to-I editing of RNA continue to be uncovered. Niescierowicz et al. report prevalent A-to-I editing in the zebrafish transcriptome, and the distinct maternal and zygotic functions of the editing enzyme Adar in embryonic patterning and in the regulation of innate immune response, respectively.",2022-09-20
46,Black carbon and dust alter the response of mountain snow cover under climate change,"By darkening the snow surface, mineral dust and black carbon (BC) deposition enhances snowmelt and triggers numerous feedbacks. Assessments of their long-term impact at the regional scale are still largely missing despite the environmental and socio-economic implications of snow cover changes. Here we show, using numerical simulations, that dust and BC deposition advanced snowmelt by 17 ± 6 days on average in the French Alps and the Pyrenees over the 1979–2018 period. BC and dust also advanced by 10-15 days the peak melt water runoff, a substantial effect on the timing of water resources availability. We also demonstrate that the decrease in BC deposition since the 1980s moderates the impact of current warming on snow cover decline. Hence, accounting for changes in light-absorbing particles deposition is required to improve the accuracy of snow cover reanalyses and climate projections, that are crucial for better understanding the past and future evolution of mountain social-ecological systems.",Black carbon and dust deposition advanced the end of the snow season by 17 days on average over the last 40 years in the French Alps and the Pyrenees. The warming-induced snow cover decline was partly offset by decreases in black carbon deposition observed since the 1980s.,2022-09-20
47,OH spectator at IrMo intermetallic narrowing activity gap between alkaline and acidic hydrogen evolution reaction,"The sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction in base has resulted in large activity gap between acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Here, we present an intermetallic IrMo electrocatalyst supported on carbon nanotubes that exhibits a specific activity of 0.95 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of 15 mV, which is 14.4 and 9.5 times of those for Ir/C and Pt/C, respectively. More importantly, its activities in base are fairly close to that in acidic electrolyte and the activity gap between acidic and alkaline media is only one fourth of that for Ir/C. DFT calculations reveal that the stably-adsorbed OH spectator at Mo site of IrMo can stabilize the water dissociation product, resulting in a thermodynamically favorable water dissociation process. Beyond offering an advanced electrocatalyst, this work provides a guidance to rationally design the desirable HER electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting by the stably-adsorbed OH spectator.","While alkaline water electrolysis offers a green means for hydrogen production, H2-evolving catalysts typically show worse activities in alkaline media than in acid. Here, authors examine IrMo intermetallics as electrocatalysts and identify a stably-adsorbed OH spectator in promoting performances.",2022-09-20
48,QuasAr Odyssey: the origin of fluorescence and its voltage sensitivity in microbial rhodopsins,"Rhodopsins had long been considered non-fluorescent until a peculiar voltage-sensitive fluorescence was reported for archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch3) derivatives. These proteins named QuasArs have been used for imaging membrane voltage changes in cell cultures and small animals, but they could not be applied in living rodents. To develop the next generation of sensors, it is indispensable to first understand the molecular basis of the fluorescence and its modulation by the membrane voltage. Based on spectroscopic studies of fluorescent Arch3 derivatives, we propose a unique photo-reaction scheme with extended excited-state lifetimes and inefficient photoisomerization. Molecular dynamics simulations of Arch3, of the Arch3 fluorescent derivative Archon1, and of several its mutants have revealed different voltage-dependent changes of the hydrogen-bonding networks including the protonated retinal Schiff-base and adjacent residues. Experimental observations suggest that under negative voltage, these changes modulate retinal Schiff base deprotonation and promote a decrease in the populations of fluorescent species. Finally, we identified molecular constraints that further improve fluorescence quantum yield and voltage sensitivity.","The authors present an in-depth investigation of excited state dynamics and molecular mechanism of the voltage sensing in microbial rhodopsins. Using a combination of spectroscopic investigations and molecular dynamics simulations, the study proposes the voltage-modulated deprotonation of the chromophore as the key event in the voltage sensing. Thus, molecular constraints that may further improve the fluorescence quantum yield and the voltage sensitivity are presented.",2022-09-20
49,An EGFR/HER2-targeted conjugate sensitizes gemcitabine-sensitive and resistant pancreatic cancer through different SMAD4-mediated mechanisms,"Chemoresistance limits its clinical implementation for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We previously generated an EGFR/HER2 targeted conjugate, dual-targeting ligand-based lidamycin (DTLL), which shows a highly potent antitumor effect. To overcome chemoresistance in PDAC, we aim to study DTLL efficacy when combined with gemcitabine and explore its mechanisms of action. DTLL in combination with gemcitabine show a superior inhibitory effect on the growth of gemcitabine-resistant/sensitive tumors. DTLL sensitizes gemcitabine efficacy via distinct action mechanisms mediated by mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4). It not only prevents neoplastic proliferation via ATK/mTOR blockade and NF-κB impaired function in SMAD4-sufficient PDACs, but also restores SMAD4 bioactivity to trigger downstream NF-κB-regulated signaling in SMAD4-deficient tumors and to overcome chemoresistance. DTLL seems to act as a SMAD4 module that normalizes its function in PDAC, having a synergistic effect in combination with gemcitabine. Our findings provide insight into a rational SMAD4-directed precision therapy in PDAC.","Chemoresistance is a main limitation for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, the authors show that an antibody drug conjugate-like compound targeting both EGFR and HER2 overcomes gemcitabine resistance in PDAC preclinical models by mechanisms involving the tumour suppressor SMAD4.",2022-09-20
50,Photoinduced loading of electron-rich Cu single atoms by moderate coordination for hydrogen evolution,"Single-atom catalysts offer maximal atom utilization efficiencies and high-electronegativity heteroatoms play a crucial role in coordinating reactive single metal atoms to prevent agglomeration. However, these strong coordination bonds withdraw electron density for coordinated metal atoms and consequently affect their catalytic activity. Herein we reveal the high loading (11.3 wt%) and stabilization of moderately coordinated Cu-P3 structure on black phosphorus support by a photochemical strategy with auxiliary hydrogen. Single-atom Cu sites with an exceptional electron-rich feature show the \(\triangle {G}_{{{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}*}\) close to zero to favor catalysis. Neighboring Cu atoms work in synergy to lower the energy of key water adsorption and dissociation intermediates. The reported catalyst shows a low overpotential of only 41 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope of 53.4 mV dec−1 for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, surpassing both isolated Cu single atoms and Cu nanoclusters. The promising materials design strategy sheds light on the design and fabrication of high-loading single metal atoms and the role of neighboring single atoms for enhanced reaction kinetics.","While atomically dispersed metals can maximize reaction catalytic sites, it is challenging to achieve high atomic densities without agglomeration. Here, authors prepared Cu single-atoms on black phosphorous using a photochemical strategy and auxiliary H2 as proton reduction electrocatalysts.",2022-09-20
51,Diabetes downregulates the antimicrobial peptide psoriasin and increases E. coli burden in the urinary bladder,"Diabetes is known to increase susceptibility to infections, partly due to impaired granulocyte function and changes in the innate immunity. Here, we investigate the effect of diabetes, and high glucose on the expression of the antimicrobial peptide, psoriasin and the putative consequences for E. coli urinary tract infection. Blood, urine, and urine exfoliated cells from patients are studied. The influence of glucose and insulin is examined during hyperglycemic clamps in individuals with prediabetes and in euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamped patients with type 1 diabetes. Important findings are confirmed in vivo in type 2 diabetic mice and verified in human uroepithelial cell lines. High glucose concentrations induce lower psoriasin levels and impair epithelial barrier function together with altering cell membrane proteins and cytoskeletal elements, resulting in increasing bacterial burden. Estradiol treatment restores the cellular function with increasing psoriasin and bacterial killing in uroepithelial cells, confirming its importance during urinary tract infection in hyperglycemia. In conclusion, our findings present the effects and underlying mechanisms of high glucose compromising innate immunity.","Patients with diabetes have an increased susceptibility to infections. Here the authors show that high glucose impairs innate immunity through reduced levels of the antimicrobial peptide psoriasin and impaired epithelial barrier function, resulting in an increased risk of urinary tract infection.",2022-09-20
52,Smart soft contact lenses for continuous 24-hour monitoring of intraocular pressure in glaucoma care,"Continuous monitoring of intraocular pressure, particularly during sleep, remains a grand challenge in glaucoma care. Here we introduce a class of smart soft contact lenses, enabling the continuous 24-hour monitoring of intraocular pressure, even during sleep. Uniquely, the smart soft contact lenses are built upon various commercial brands of soft contact lenses without altering their intrinsic properties such as lens power, biocompatibility, softness, transparency, wettability, oxygen transmissibility, and overnight wearability. We show that the smart soft contact lenses can seamlessly fit across different corneal curvatures and thicknesses in human eyes and therefore accurately measure absolute intraocular pressure under ambulatory conditions. We perform a comprehensive set of in vivo evaluations in rabbit, dog, and human eyes from normal to hypertension to confirm the superior measurement accuracy, within-subject repeatability, and user comfort of the smart soft contact lenses beyond current wearable ocular tonometers. We envision that the smart soft contact lenses will be effective in glaucoma care.","Continuous monitoring of intraocular pressure remains a grand challenge in glaucoma care. Here the authors develop smart soft contact lenses for continuous 24-hour monitoring of intraocular pressure in human eyes, even during sleep.",2022-09-20
53,Screening microbially produced Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol using a yeast biosensor workflow,"Microbial production of cannabinoids promises to provide a consistent, cheaper, and more sustainable supply of these important therapeutic molecules. However, scaling production to compete with traditional plant-based sources is challenging. Our ability to make strain variants greatly exceeds our capacity to screen and identify high producers, creating a bottleneck in metabolic engineering efforts. Here, we present a yeast-based biosensor for detecting microbially produced Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to increase throughput and lower the cost of screening. We port five human cannabinoid G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) into yeast, showing the cannabinoid type 2 receptor, CB2R, can couple to the yeast pheromone response pathway and report on the concentration of a variety of cannabinoids over a wide dynamic and operational range. We demonstrate that our cannabinoid biosensor can detect THC from microbial cell culture and use this as a tool for measuring relative production yields from a library of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol acid synthase (THCAS) mutants.","Microbial production of cannabinoids promises a cheaper and more sustainable route to these important therapeutic molecules, but strain improvement and screening is challenging. Here, the authors develop a yeast-based Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) biosensor for screening microbial mutant libraries.",2022-09-20
54,Global soil profiles indicate depth-dependent soil carbon losses under a warmer climate,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) changes under future climate warming are difficult to quantify in situ. Here we apply an innovative approach combining space-for-time substitution with meta-analysis to SOC measurements in 113,013 soil profiles across the globe to estimate the effect of future climate warming on steady-state SOC stocks. We find that SOC stock will reduce by 6.0 ± 1.6% (mean±95% confidence interval), 4.8 ± 2.3% and 1.3 ± 4.0% at 0–0.3, 0.3–1 and 1–2 m soil depths, respectively, under 1 °C air warming, with additional 4.2%, 2.2% and 1.4% losses per every additional 1 °C warming, respectively. The largest proportional SOC losses occur in boreal forests. Existing SOC level is the predominant determinant of the spatial variability of SOC changes with higher percentage losses in SOC-rich soils. Our work demonstrates that warming induces more proportional SOC losses in topsoil than in subsoil, particularly from high-latitudinal SOC-rich systems.","The response of soil organic carbon to climate warming may be soil depth-dependent, but remains unquantified in situ. Here the authors show that warming induces more proportional soil carbon losses in topsoil than in subsoil, particularly from high-latitudinal carbon-rich soils.",2022-09-20
55,Many-body localization enables iterative quantum optimization,"Many discrete optimization problems are exponentially hard due to the underlying glassy landscape. This means that the optimization cost exhibits multiple local minima separated by an extensive number of switched discrete variables. Quantum computation was coined to overcome this predicament, but so far had only a limited progress. Here we suggest a quantum approximate optimization algorithm which is based on a repetitive cycling around the tricritical point of the many-body localization (MBL) transition. Each cycle includes quantum melting of the glassy state through a first order transition with a subsequent reentrance through the second order MBL transition. Keeping the reentrance path sufficiently close to the tricritical point separating the first and second order transitions, allows one to systematically improve optimization outcomes. The running time of this algorithm scales algebraically with the system size and the required precision. The corresponding exponents are related to critical indexes of the continuous MBL transition.","There are several proposals for quantum algorithms solving optimisation problems, but so far none of them has provided a clear speedup. Here, the authors propose an iterative protocol featuring periodic cycling around the tricritical point of a many-body localization transition.",2022-09-20
56,Deciphering multi-way interactions in the human genome,"Chromatin architecture, a key regulator of gene expression, can be inferred using chromatin contact data from chromosome conformation capture, or Hi-C. However, classical Hi-C does not preserve multi-way contacts. Here we use long sequencing reads to map genome-wide multi-way contacts and investigate higher order chromatin organization in the human genome. We use hypergraph theory for data representation and analysis, and quantify higher order structures in neonatal fibroblasts, biopsied adult fibroblasts, and B lymphocytes. By integrating multi-way contacts with chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and transcription factor binding, we introduce a data-driven method to identify cell type-specific transcription clusters. We provide transcription factor-mediated functional building blocks for cell identity that serve as a global signature for cell types.","Mapping higher order chromatin architecture is important. Here the authors use long sequencing reads to map genome-wide multi-way contacts and investigate higher order chromatin organisation; they use hypergraph theory for data representation and analysis, and apply this to different cell types.",2022-09-20
57,Learning enhances encoding of time and temporal surprise in mouse primary sensory cortex,"Primary sensory cortex has long been believed to play a straightforward role in the initial processing of sensory information. Yet, the superficial layers of cortex overall are sparsely active, even during sensory stimulation; additionally, cortical activity is influenced by other modalities, task context, reward, and behavioral state. Our study demonstrates that reinforcement learning dramatically alters representations among longitudinally imaged neurons in superficial layers of mouse primary somatosensory cortex. Learning an object detection task recruits previously unresponsive neurons, enlarging the neuronal population sensitive to touch and behavioral choice. Cortical responses decrease upon repeated stimulus presentation outside of the behavioral task. Moreover, training improves population encoding of the passage of time, and unexpected deviations in trial timing elicit even stronger responses than touches do. In conclusion, the superficial layers of sensory cortex exhibit a high degree of learning-dependent plasticity and are strongly modulated by non-sensory but behaviorally-relevant features, such as timing and surprise.","Activity in the superficial layers of the sensory cortex is believed to be largely driven by incoming sensory stimuli. Here the authors demonstrate how learning changes neural responses to sensations according to both behavioral relevance and timing, suggesting a high degree of non-sensory modulation.",2022-09-20
58,The AAA+ ATPase RavA and its binding partner ViaA modulate E. coli aminoglycoside sensitivity through interaction with the inner membrane,"Enteric bacteria have to adapt to environmental stresses in the human gastrointestinal tract such as acid and nutrient stress, oxygen limitation and exposure to antibiotics. Membrane lipid composition has recently emerged as a key factor for stress adaptation. The E. coli ravA-viaA operon is essential for aminoglycoside bactericidal activity under anaerobiosis but its mechanism of action is unclear. Here we characterise the VWA domain-protein ViaA and its interaction with the AAA+ ATPase RavA, and find that both proteins localise at the inner cell membrane. We demonstrate that RavA and ViaA target specific phospholipids and subsequently identify their lipid-binding sites. We further show that mutations abolishing interaction with lipids restore induced changes in cell membrane morphology and lipid composition. Finally we reveal that these mutations render E. coli gentamicin-resistant under fumarate respiration conditions. Our work thus uncovers a ravA-viaA-based pathway which is mobilised in response to aminoglycosides under anaerobiosis and engaged in cell membrane regulation.","Membrane lipid composition is a key factor for bacterial stress adaptation. Here, authors show that ViaA and AAA+ ATPase RavA, alter lipid composition and modulate E. coli aminoglycoside sensitivity.",2022-09-20
59,Small soluble α-synuclein aggregates are the toxic species in Parkinson’s disease,"Soluble α-synuclein aggregates varying in size, structure, and morphology have been closely linked to neuronal death in Parkinson’s disease. However, the heterogeneity of different co-existing aggregate species makes it hard to isolate and study their individual toxic properties. Here, we show a reliable non-perturbative method to separate a heterogeneous mixture of protein aggregates by size. We find that aggregates of wild-type α-synuclein smaller than 200 nm in length, formed during an in vitro aggregation reaction, cause inflammation and permeabilization of single-liposome membranes and that larger aggregates are less toxic. Studying soluble aggregates extracted from post-mortem human brains also reveals that these aggregates are similar in size and structure to the smaller aggregates formed in aggregation reactions in the test tube. Furthermore, we find that the soluble aggregates present in Parkinson’s disease brains are smaller, largely less than 100 nm, and more inflammatory compared to the larger aggregates present in control brains. This study suggests that the small non-fibrillar α-synuclein aggregates are the critical species driving neuroinflammation and disease progression.","α-synuclein aggregates cause neuronal damage, but their heterogeneity complicates studying their toxic properties. Here, the authors analyze α-synuclein aggregates in vitro and study post-mortem brain samples, providing evidence that small aggregates are the main culprit for neuronal death in Parkinson’s disease.",2022-09-20
60,Negative electrostatic potentials in a Hofmann-type metal-organic framework for efficient acetylene separation,"Efficient adsorptive separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) or ethylene (C2H4) is industrially important but challenging due to the identical dynamic diameter or the trace amount. Here we show an electrostatic potential compatible strategy in a nitroprusside-based Hofmann-type metal-organic framework, Cu(bpy)NP (NP = nitroprusside, bpy = 4,4’-bipyridine), for efficient C2H2 separation. The intruding cyanide and nitrosyl groups in undulating one-dimensional channels induce negative electrostatic potentials for preferential C2H2 recognition instead of open metal sites in traditional Hofmann-type MOFs. As a result, Cu(bpy)NP exhibits a 50/50 C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 47.2, outperforming most rigid MOFs. The dynamic breakthrough experiment demonstrates a 99.9% purity C2H4 productivity of 20.57 mmol g−1 from C2H2/C2H4 (1/99, v/v) gas-mixture. Meanwhile, C2H2 can also be captured and recognized from ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 (25/25/50, v/v/v) gas-mixture. Furthermore, computational studies and in-situ infrared spectroscopy reveal that the selective C2H2 binding arises from the compatible pore electro-environment generated by the electron-rich N and O atoms from nitroprusside anions.",Separating acetylene from carbon dioxide or ethylene is challenging due to near identical molecular diameters or the trace amounts. Here authors prepare nitroprusside-based Hofmann-type MOFs for efficient C2H2 separation and recognition.,2022-09-20
61,Enhanced oxygen evolution over dual corner-shared cobalt tetrahedra,"Developing efficient catalysts is of paramount importance to oxygen evolution, a sluggish anodic reaction that provides essential electrons and protons for various electrochemical processes, such as hydrogen generation. Here, we report that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be efficiently catalyzed by cobalt tetrahedra, which are stabilized over the surface of a Swedenborgite-type YBCo4O7 material. We reveal that the surface of YBaCo4O7 possesses strong resilience towards structural amorphization during OER, which originates from its distinctive structural evolution toward electrochemical oxidation. The bulk of YBaCo4O7 composes of corner-sharing only CoO4 tetrahedra, which can flexibly alter their positions to accommodate the insertion of interstitial oxygen ions and mediate the stress during the electrochemical oxidation. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the OER is efficiently catalyzed by a binuclear active site of dual corner-shared cobalt tetrahedra, which have a coordination number switching between 3 and 4 during the reaction. We expect that the reported active structural motif of dual corner-shared cobalt tetrahedra in this study could enable further development of compounds for catalyzing the OER.","Efficient oxygen evolution relies on the development of promising catalysts. Herein, the authors demonstrate that cobalt tetrahedra, stabilized over the surface of YBCo4O7 material, can catalyze oxygen evolution reaction efficiently.",2022-09-20
62,Single cell atlas identifies lipid-processing and immunomodulatory endothelial cells in healthy and malignant breast,"Since a detailed inventory of endothelial cell (EC) heterogeneity in breast cancer (BC) is lacking, here we perform single cell RNA-sequencing of 26,515 cells (including 8433 ECs) from 9 BC patients and compare them to published EC taxonomies from lung tumors. Angiogenic ECs are phenotypically similar, while other EC subtypes are different. Predictive interactome analysis reveals known but also previously unreported receptor-ligand interactions between ECs and immune cells, suggesting an involvement of breast EC subtypes in immune responses. We also identify a capillary EC subtype (LIPEC (Lipid Processing EC)), which expresses genes involved in lipid processing that are regulated by PPAR-γ and is more abundant in peri-tumoral breast tissue. Retrospective analysis of 4648 BC patients reveals that treatment with metformin (an indirect PPAR-γ signaling activator) provides long-lasting clinical benefit and is positively associated with LIPEC abundance. Our findings warrant further exploration of this LIPEC/PPAR-γ link for BC treatment.","Tumor blood vessels contribute to cancer growth, invasion and metastasis. Here, by using single cell transcriptomics, the authors report an inventory of endothelial cell heterogeneity in patients with breast cancer, including a subtype that expresses genes involved in lipid processing and is regulated by PPAR-γ.",2022-09-20
63,Structure of the PAPP-ABP5 complex reveals mechanism of substrate recognition,"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is highly conserved and tightly regulated by proteases including Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPP-A). PAPP-A and its paralog PAPP-A2 are metalloproteases that mediate IGF bioavailability through cleavage of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). Here, we present single-particle cryo-EM structures of the catalytically inactive mutant PAPP-A (E483A) in complex with a peptide from its substrate IGFBP5 (PAPP-ABP5) and also in its substrate-free form, by leveraging the power of AlphaFold to generate a high quality predicted model as a starting template. We show that PAPP-A is a flexible trans-dimer that binds IGFBP5 via a 25-amino acid anchor peptide which extends into the metalloprotease active site. This unique IGFBP5 anchor peptide that mediates the specific PAPP-A-IGFBP5 interaction is not found in other PAPP-A substrates. Additionally, we illustrate the critical role of the PAPP-A central domain as it mediates both IGFBP5 recognition and trans-dimerization. We further demonstrate that PAPP-A trans-dimer formation and distal inter-domain interactions are both required for efficient proteolysis of IGFBP4, but dispensable for IGFBP5 cleavage. Together the structural and biochemical studies reveal the mechanism of PAPP-A substrate binding and selectivity.","PAPP-A substrate selectivity underlies the tight regulation of IGF signaling. Here, the authors report cryo-EM structures of dimeric PAPP-A in its substrate-free form and in complex with a peptide substrate, which combined with biochemical assays provide a mechanism for PAPP-A substrate binding and selectivity.",2022-09-20
64,(NHC)Pd(II) hydride-catalyzed dehydroaromatization by olefin chain-walking isomerization and transfer-dehydrogenation,"Transition-metal-catalyzed homogeneous dehydrogenation and isomerization are common organic molecular activation reactions. Palladium hydrides are good olefin isomerization catalysts but are usually short-lived species under redox-active dehydrogenation conditions. Here, we show that Pd-H in the presence of an N-heterocyclic carbene ligand and an alkene regulator enables transfer-dehydroaromatization, avoiding the homo-disproportionation pathway. The desired product is obtained with up to 99:1 selectivity, and the exo-to-endo olefin isomerization can be carried out in one pot. In contrast to previously reported methods that rely on the efficient removal of Pd-H, the approach reported herein benefits from the steric effects of the N-heterocyclic carbene and the choice of alkene to regulate the competing reactivity of allylic C‒H activation and hydropalladation. This method circumvents the challenges associated with tedious olefin separation and a low exo-to-endo olefin isomerization ratio and expands the scope to include challenging endo- and exo-cyclic olefins under mild, neutral, and oxidant-free conditions. Overall, herein, we provide a strategy to synthesize (hetero)aromatic compounds via chemoselective dehydrogenation of cyclic alkenes over ketones and the dehydrogenative Diels-Alder reaction of a cyclic enamine.",Aromatic compounds can be prepared via dehydrogenation of cyclic compounds. Here the authors report the dehydroaromatization of endocyclic and exocyclic olefins via chain-walking isomerization and transfer-dehydrogenation catalyzed by palladium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes in the presence of alkenes as sacrificial reagents.,2022-09-20
65,DNA methylation as a pharmacodynamic marker of glucocorticoid response and glioma survival,"Assessing individual responses to glucocorticoid drug therapies that compromise immune status and affect survival outcomes in neuro-oncology is a great challenge. Here we introduce a blood-based neutrophil dexamethasone methylation index (NDMI) that provides a measure of the epigenetic response of subjects to dexamethasone. This marker outperforms conventional approaches based on leukocyte composition as a marker of glucocorticoid response. The NDMI is associated with low CD4 T cells and the accumulation of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and also serves as prognostic factor in glioma survival. In a non-glioma population, the NDMI increases with a history of prednisone use. Therefore, it may also be informative in other conditions where glucocorticoids are employed. We conclude that DNA methylation remodeling within the peripheral immune compartment is a rich source of clinically relevant markers of glucocorticoid response.","Glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, are used as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, however patients may exhibit resistance or side effects. Here the authors propose that a dexamethasone related neutrophil-specific DNA methylation index can be used as a marker of glucocorticoid exposure and response and as a prognostic factor in brain tumor survival.",2022-09-20
66,An anti-inflammatory activation sequence governs macrophage transcriptional dynamics during tissue injury in zebrafish,"Macrophages are essential for tissue repair and regeneration. Yet, the molecular programs, as well as the timing of their activation during and after tissue injury are poorly defined. Using a high spatio-temporal resolution single cell analysis of macrophages coupled with live imaging after sensory hair cell death in zebrafish, we find that the same population of macrophages transitions through a sequence of three major anti-inflammatory activation states. Macrophages first show a signature of glucocorticoid activation, then IL-10 signaling and finally the induction of oxidative phosphorylation by IL-4/Polyamine signaling. Importantly, loss-of-function of glucocorticoid and IL-10 signaling shows that each step of the sequence is independently activated. Lastly, we show that IL-10 and IL-4 signaling act synergistically to promote synaptogenesis between hair cells and efferent neurons during regeneration. Our results show that macrophages, in addition to a switch from M1 to M2, sequentially and independently transition though three anti-inflammatory pathways in vivo during tissue injury in a regenerating organ.","Macrophages are important for tissue regeneration after injury. Here, using a single cell sequencing approach in a zebrafish injury model, the authors show that macrophages transition through a three stage process during tissue regeneration after hair cell damage.",2022-09-20
67,Systematic profiling of conditional degron tag technologies for target validation studies,"Conditional degron tags (CDTs) are a powerful tool for target validation that combines the kinetics and reversible action of pharmacological agents with the generalizability of genetic manipulation. However, successful design of a CDT fusion protein often requires a prolonged, ad hoc cycle of construct design, failure, and re-design. To address this limitation, we report here a system to rapidly compare the activity of five unique CDTs: AID/AID2, IKZF3d, dTAG, HaloTag, and SMASh. We demonstrate the utility of this system against 16 unique protein targets. We find that expression and degradation are highly dependent on the specific CDT, the construct design, and the target. None of the CDTs leads to efficient expression and/or degradation across all targets; however, our systematic approach enables the identification of at least one optimal CDT fusion for each target. To enable the adoption of CDT strategies more broadly, we have made these reagents, and a detailed protocol, available as a community resource.","Conditional Degron Tags are a valuable tool to validate and study novel therapeutic targets. Here, the authors compared 5 orthogonal tags across 16 unique proteins and provide a panel of vectors for users to systematically screen the tags with their own protein of interest.",2022-09-20
68,Insight into mode-of-action and structural determinants of the compstatin family of clinical complement inhibitors,"With the addition of the compstatin-based complement C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan, another class of complement targeted therapeutics have recently been approved. Moreover, compstatin derivatives with enhanced pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles are in clinical development (e.g., Cp40/AMY-101). Despite this progress, the target binding and inhibitory modes of the compstatin family remain incompletely described. Here, we present the crystal structure of Cp40 complexed with its target C3b at 2.0-Å resolution. Structure-activity-relationship studies rationalize the picomolar affinity and long target residence achieved by lead optimization, and reveal a role for structural water in inhibitor binding. We provide explanations for the narrow species specificity of this drug class and demonstrate distinct target selection modes between clinical compstatin derivatives. Functional studies provide further insight into physiological complement activation and corroborate the mechanism of its compstatin-mediated inhibition. Our study may thereby guide the application of existing and development of next-generation compstatin analogs.","Therapeutic modulation of the complement system has gained interest over the past two decades. Here, the authors provide molecular-level insight into the mode-of-action, target selectivity and species specificity of the compstatin family of complement inhibitors, which entered the clinic in 2021.",2022-09-20
69,Structural basis of adhesion GPCR GPR110 activation by stalk peptide and G-proteins coupling,"Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are keys of many physiological events and attractive targets for various diseases. aGPCRs are also known to be capable of self-activation via an autoproteolysis process that removes the inhibitory GAIN domain on the extracellular side of receptor and releases a stalk peptide to bind and activate the transmembrane side of receptor. However, the detailed mechanism of aGPCR activation remains elusive. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of GPR110 (ADGRF1), a member of aGPCR, in complex with Gq, Gs, Gi, G12 and G13. The structures reveal distinctive ligand engaging model and activation conformations of GPR110. The structures also unveil the rarely explored GPCR/G12 and GPCR/G13 engagements. A comparison of Gq, Gs, Gi, G12 and G13 engagements with GPR110 reveals details of G-protein engagement, including a dividing point at the far end of the alpha helix 5 (αH5) of Gα subunit that separates Gq/Gs engagements from Gi/G12/G13 engagements. This is also where Gq/Gs bind the receptor through both hydrophobic and polar interaction, while Gi/G12/G13 engage receptor mainly through hydrophobic interaction. We further provide physiological evidence of GPR110 activation via stalk peptide. Taken together, our study fills the missing information of GPCR/G-protein engagement and provides a framework for understanding aGPCR activation and GPR110 signaling.","aGPCRs play key roles in multiple physiological processes. Here the authors report cryo-EM structures of GPR110 in complexes with Gq, Gs, Gi, G12 and G13 protein to reveal a detailed mechanism of aGPCR activation via the tethered stalk peptide and principles of G-protein coupling and selectivity on GPR110.",2022-09-20
70,Transformation of primary sensory cortical representations from layer 4 to layer 2,"Sensory input arrives from thalamus in cortical layer (L) 4, which outputs predominantly to superficial layers. L4 to L2 thus constitutes one of the earliest cortical feedforward networks. Despite extensive study, the transformation performed by this network remains poorly understood. We use two-photon calcium imaging to record neural activity in L2-4 of primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1) as mice perform an object localization task with two whiskers. Touch responses sparsen and become more reliable from L4 to L2, with nearly half of the superficial touch response confined to ~1 % of excitatory neurons. These highly responsive neurons have broad receptive fields and can more accurately decode stimulus features. They participate disproportionately in ensembles, small subnetworks with elevated pairwise correlations. Thus, from L4 to L2, cortex transitions from distributed probabilistic coding to sparse and robust ensemble-based coding, resulting in more efficient and accurate representations.","The transform performed by superficial primary sensory cortex is poorly understood. Here the authors show that sensory stimulus-evoked activity shifts from a broadly distributed, probabilistic response in cortical layer 4 to a sparse and robust ensemble-based response in cortical layer 2.",2022-09-19
71,Flexible cue anchoring strategies enable stable head direction coding in both sighted and blind animals,"Vision plays a crucial role in instructing the brain’s spatial navigation systems. However, little is known about how vision loss affects the neuronal encoding of spatial information. Here, recording from head direction (HD) cells in the anterior dorsal nucleus of the thalamus in mice, we find stable and robust HD tuning in rd1 mice, a model of photoreceptor degeneration, that go blind by approximately one month of age. In contrast, placing sighted animals in darkness significantly impairs HD cell tuning. We find that blind mice use olfactory cues to maintain stable HD tuning and that prior visual experience leads to refined HD cell tuning in blind rd1 adult mice compared to congenitally blind animals. Finally, in the absence of both visual and olfactory cues, the HD attractor network remains intact but the preferred firing direction of HD cells drifts over time. These findings demonstrate flexibility in how the brain uses diverse sensory information to generate a stable directional representation of space.","Vision plays an important role in the head direction cell system in animals. Here the authors recorded from head direction cells in rd1 mice that show retinal degeneration at 1 month, and find that they use smell cues to maintain stable HD tuning.",2022-09-19
72,Integrated stem cell signature and cytomolecular risk determination in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia,"Relapsed or refractory pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with poor outcomes and relapse risk prediction approaches have not changed significantly in decades. To build a robust transcriptional risk prediction model for pediatric AML, we perform RNA-sequencing on 1503 primary diagnostic samples. While a 17 gene leukemia stem cell signature (LSC17) is predictive in our aggregated pediatric study population, LSC17 is no longer predictive within established cytogenetic and molecular (cytomolecular) risk groups. Therefore, we identify distinct LSC signatures on the basis of AML cytomolecular subtypes (LSC47) that were more predictive than LSC17. Based on these findings, we build a robust relapse prediction model within a training cohort and then validate it within independent cohorts. Here, we show that LSC47 increases the predictive power of conventional risk stratification and that applying biomarkers in a manner that is informed by cytomolecular profiling outperforms a uniform biomarker approach.","Relapsed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia is associated with poor prognosis. Here, the authors use RNA-seq data from 1503 primary samples to create a combined transcriptional and cytomolecular signature to improve relapse risk prediction.",2022-09-19
73,A stem cell roadmap of ribosome heterogeneity reveals a function for RPL10A in mesoderm production,"Recent findings suggest that the ribosome itself modulates gene expression. However, whether ribosomes change composition across cell types or control cell fate remains unknown. Here, employing quantitative mass spectrometry during human embryonic stem cell differentiation, we identify dozens of ribosome composition changes underlying cell fate specification. We observe upregulation of RPL10A/uL1-containing ribosomes in the primitive streak followed by progressive decreases during mesoderm differentiation. An Rpl10a loss-of-function allele in mice causes striking early mesodermal phenotypes, including posterior trunk truncations, and inhibits paraxial mesoderm production in culture. Ribosome profiling in Rpl10a loss-of-function mice reveals decreased translation of mesoderm regulators, including Wnt pathway mRNAs, which are also enriched on RPL10A/uL1-containing ribosomes. We further show that RPL10A/uL1 regulates canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling during stem cell differentiation and in the developing embryo. These findings reveal unexpected ribosome composition modularity that controls differentiation and development through the specialized translation of key signaling networks.","How ribosomes differ in composition and function to regulate gene expression is poorly understood. Here, the authors show that ribosome composition changes during stem cell differentiation and identify a ribosomal protein that regulates production of the mesoderm lineage.",2022-09-19
74,Angiocrine extracellular vesicles impose mesenchymal reprogramming upon proneural glioma stem cells,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable form of primary astrocytic brain tumor driven by glioma stem cell (GSC) compartment closely associated with the vascular niche. GSC phenotypes are heterogeneous and range from proneural to mesenchymal-like, the latter characterised by greater invasiveness. Here we document the secretory (angiocrine) role of endothelial cells and their derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as drivers of proneural-to-mesenchymal reprogramming of GSCs. These changes involve activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and NFκB, and inactivation of NOTCH, while altering responsiveness to chemotherapy and driving infiltrative growth in the brain. Our findings suggest that EV-mediated angiocrine interactions impact the nature of cellular stemness in GBM with implications for disease biology and therapy.","Glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) exhibit plasticity during proneural-to-mesenchymal transition. Here the authors show that extracellular vesicles from endothelial cells can promote this transition of GSCs through activation of MMPs and NFkB, and inactivation of NOTCH.",2022-09-19
75,High field magnetometry with hyperpolarized nuclear spins,"Quantum sensors have attracted broad interest in the quest towards sub-micronscale NMR spectroscopy. Such sensors predominantly operate at low magnetic fields. Instead, however, for high resolution spectroscopy, the high-field regime is naturally advantageous because it allows high absolute chemical shift discrimination. Here we demonstrate a high-field spin magnetometer constructed from an ensemble of hyperpolarized 13C nuclear spins in diamond. They are initialized by Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers and protected along a transverse Bloch sphere axis for minute-long periods. When exposed to a time-varying (AC) magnetic field, they undergo secondary precessions that carry an imprint of its frequency and amplitude. For quantum sensing at 7T, we demonstrate detection bandwidth up to 7 kHz, a spectral resolution < 100mHz, and single-shot sensitivity of 410pT\(/\sqrt{{{{{{{{\rm{Hz}}}}}}}}}\). This work anticipates opportunities for microscale NMR chemical sensors constructed from hyperpolarized nanodiamonds and suggests applications of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in quantum sensing.","Quantum sensors based on NV centers in diamond find applications in high spatial resolution NMR spectroscopy, but their operation is typically limited to low fields.

76,Dominant role of DNA methylation over H3K9me3 for IAP silencing in endoderm,"Silencing of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) is largely mediated by repressive chromatin modifications H3K9me3 and DNA methylation. On ERVs, these modifications are mainly deposited by the histone methyltransferase Setdb1 and by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. Knock-out of either Setdb1 or Dnmt1 leads to ERV de-repression in various cell types. However, it is currently not known if H3K9me3 and DNA methylation depend on each other for ERV silencing. Here we show that conditional knock-out of Setdb1 in mouse embryonic endoderm results in ERV de-repression in visceral endoderm (VE) descendants and does not occur in definitive endoderm (DE). Deletion of Setdb1 in VE progenitors results in loss of H3K9me3 and reduced DNA methylation of Intracisternal A-particle (IAP) elements, consistent with up-regulation of this ERV family. In DE, loss of Setdb1 does not affect H3K9me3 nor DNA methylation, suggesting Setdb1-independent pathways for maintaining these modifications. Importantly, Dnmt1 knock-out results in IAP de-repression in both visceral and definitive endoderm cells, while H3K9me3 is unaltered. Thus, our data suggest a dominant role of DNA methylation over H3K9me3 for IAP silencing in endoderm cells. Our findings suggest that Setdb1-meditated H3K9me3 is not sufficient for IAP silencing, but rather critical for maintaining high DNA methylation.",Silencing of endogenous retroviruses is crucial for maintaining transcriptional and genomic integrity of cells and is maintained by histone H3K9 methylation and/or DNA methylation in various cell types. Here the authors show that loss of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in endoderm results in ERV derepression while H3K9me3 is unaltered.,2022-09-19
77,Causal contribution of optic flow signal in Macaque extrastriate visual cortex for roll perception,"Optic flow is a powerful cue for inferring self-motion status which is critical for postural control, spatial orientation, locomotion and navigation. In primates, neurons in extrastriate visual cortex (MSTd) are predominantly modulated by high-order optic flow patterns (e.g., spiral), yet a functional link to direct perception is lacking. Here, we applied electrical microstimulation to selectively manipulate population of MSTd neurons while macaques discriminated direction of rotation around line-of-sight (roll) or direction of linear-translation (heading), two tasks which were orthogonal in 3D spiral coordinate using a four-alternative-forced-choice paradigm. Microstimulation frequently biased animal’s roll perception towards coded labeled-lines of the artificial-stimulated neurons in either context with spiral or pure-rotation stimuli. Choice frequency was also altered between roll and translation flow-pattern. Our results provide direct causal-link evidence supporting that roll signals in MSTd, despite often mixed with translation signals, can be extracted by downstream areas for perception of rotation relative to gravity-vertical.","Extrastriate visual cortex encodes optic flow, yet a direct link to perception has yet to be established. Here, the authors apply electrical microstimulation to reveal that roll signals in MSTd causally contribute to rotation perception around line-of-sight.",2022-09-19
78,Extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein released by intracellular Staphylococcus aureus suppresses host immunity by targeting TRAF3,"Many pathogens secrete effectors to hijack intracellular signaling regulators in host immune cells to promote pathogenesis. However, the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus secretory effectors within host cells is unclear. Here, we report that Staphylococcus aureus secretes extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb) into the cytoplasm of macrophages to suppress host immunity. Mechanistically, RING finger protein 114, a host E3 ligase, mediates K27-linked ubiquitination of Efb at lysine 71, which facilitates the recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor (TRAF) 3. The binding of Efb to TRAF3 disrupts the formation of the TRAF3/TRAF2/cIAP1 (cellular-inhibitor-of-apoptosis-1) complex, which mediates K48-ubiquitination of TRAF3 to promote degradation, resulting in suppression of the inflammatory signaling cascade. Additionally, the Efb K71R mutant loses the ability to inhibit inflammation and exhibits decreased pathogenicity. Therefore, our findings identify an unrecognized mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus to suppress host defense, which may be a promising target for developing effective anti-Staphylococcus aureus immunomodulators.","Staphylococcus aureus secrete numerous effectors to evade or inhibit the host immune response, yet the mechanism underlying the effectors ability to manipulate the signalling pathways of macrophages remain unclear. Authors utilise in vitro and in vivo models to explore the role of extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb) in immune response modulation and pathogenicity.",2022-09-19
79,ARID1A mutations confer intrinsic and acquired resistance to cetuximab treatment in colorectal cancer,"Most colorectal (CRC) tumors are dependent on EGFR/KRAS/BRAF/MAPK signaling activation. ARID1A is an epigenetic regulator mutated in approximately 5% of non-hypermutated CRC tumors. Here we show that anti-EGFR but not anti-VEGF treatment enriches for emerging ARID1A mutations in CRC patients. In addition, we find that patients with ARID1A mutations, at baseline, are associated with worse outcome when treated with cetuximab- but not bevacizumab-containing therapies; thus, this suggests that ARID1A mutations may provide both an acquired and intrinsic mechanism of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. We find that, ARID1A and EGFR-pathway genetic alterations are mutually exclusive across lung and colorectal cancers, further supporting a functional connection between these pathways. Our results not only suggest that ARID1A could be potentially used as a predictive biomarker for cetuximab treatment decisions but also provide a rationale for exploring therapeutic MAPK inhibition in an unexpected but genetically defined segment of CRC patients.","ARID1A is an epigenetic regulator mutated in approximately 5% of non-hypermutated colorectal cancer tumors, however, its relationship with treatment response remains to be explored.

80,The effect of carbon fertilization on naturally regenerated and planted US forests,"Over the last half century in the United States, the per-hectare volume of wood in trees has increased, but it is not clear whether this increase has been driven by forest management, forest recovery from past land uses, such as agriculture, or other environmental factors such as elevated carbon dioxide, nitrogen deposition, or climate change. This paper uses empirical analysis to estimate the effect of elevated carbon dioxide on aboveground wood volume in temperate forests of the United States. To accomplish this, we employ matching techniques that allow us to disentangle the effects of elevated carbon dioxide from other environmental factors affecting wood volume and to estimate the effects separately for planted and natural stands. We show that elevated carbon dioxide has had a strong and consistently positive effect on wood volume while other environmental factors yielded a mix of both positive and negative effects. This study, by enabling a better understanding of how elevated carbon dioxide and other anthropogenic factors are influencing forest stocks, can help policymakers and other stakeholders better account for the role of forests in Nationally Determined Contributions and global mitigation pathways to achieve a 1.5 degree Celsius target.","The CO2 fertilisation effect in forests remains controversial. Here, the authors disentangle the effect of CO2 on forest wood volume from other environmental factors, showing that elevated CO2 had a positive effect on wood volume in planted and natural US temperate forests.",2022-09-19
81,The imprint of star formation on stellar pulsations,"In the earliest phases of their evolution, stars gain mass through the acquisition of matter from their birth clouds. The widely accepted classical concept of early stellar evolution neglects the details of this accretion phase and assumes the formation of stars with large initial radii that contract gravitationally. In this picture, the common idea is that once the stars begin their fusion processes, they have forgotten their past. By analysing stellar oscillations in recently born stars, we show that the accretion history leaves a potentially detectable imprint on the stars’ interior structures. Currently available data from space would allow discriminating between these more realistic accretion scenarios and the classical early stellar evolution models. This opens a window to investigate the interior structures of young pulsating stars that will also be of relevance for related fields, such as stellar oscillations in general and exoplanet studies.","The classical stellar evolution concept assumes that when the stars arrive on the main sequence, there is no traceable mark remains about their early evolutionary history. Here, the authors show that the accretion history leaves an imprint on the interior structure of the stars that are potentially detectable via asteroseismology.",2022-09-19
82,Stress induced TDP-43 mobility loss independent of stress granules,"TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is closely related to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and translocates to stress granules (SGs). The role of SGs as aggregation-promoting “crucibles” for TDP-43, however, is still under debate. We analyzed TDP-43 mobility and localization under different stress and recovery conditions using live cell single-molecule tracking and super-resolution microscopy. Besides reduced mobility within SGs, a stress induced decrease of TDP-43 mobility in the cytoplasm and the nucleus was observed. Stress removal led to a recovery of TDP-43 mobility, which strongly depended on the stress duration. ‘Stimulated-emission depletion microscopy’ (STED) and ‘tracking and localization microscopy’ (TALM) revealed not only TDP-43 substructures within stress granules but also numerous patches of slow TDP-43 species throughout the cytoplasm. This work provides insights into the aggregation of TDP-43 in living cells and provide evidence suggesting that TDP-43 oligomerization and aggregation takes place in the cytoplasm separate from SGs.","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis related TDP-43 protein translocates to stress granules with a concomitant reduction in mobility. Here, the authors use single molecule tracking and find a stress-induced reduction in TDP-43 mobility also in the cytoplasm potentially relevant for TDP-43 aggregation.",2022-09-19
83,Biosynthesis of plant hemostatic dencichine in Escherichia coli,"Dencichine is a plant-derived nature product that has found various pharmacological applications. Currently, its natural biosynthetic pathway is still elusive, posing challenge to its heterologous biosynthesis. In this work, we design artificial pathways through retro-biosynthesis approaches and achieve de novo production of dencichine. First, biosynthesis of the two direct precursors L−2, 3-diaminopropionate and oxalyl-CoA is achieved by screening and integrating microbial enzymes. Second, the solubility of dencichine synthase, which is the last and only plant-derived pathway enzyme, is significantly improved by introducing 28 synonymous rare codons into the codon-optimized gene to slow down its translation rate. Last, the metabolic network is systematically engineered to direct the carbon flux to dencichine production, and the final titer reaches 1.29 g L−1 with a yield of 0.28 g g−1 glycerol. This work lays the foundation for sustainable production of dencichine and represents an example of how synthetic biology can be harnessed to generate unnatural pathways to produce a desired molecule.","Biosynthetic pathway of dencichine, a plant derived nature product that has found various pharmacological applications, is still elusive.

84,Identification of spatially variable genes with graph cuts,"Single-cell gene expression data with positional information is critical to dissect mechanisms and architectures of multicellular organisms, but the potential is limited by the scalability of current data analysis strategies. Here, we present scGCO, a method based on fast optimization of hidden Markov Random Fields with graph cuts to identify spatially variable genes. Comparing to existing methods, scGCO delivers a superior performance with lower false positive rate and improved specificity, while demonstrates a more robust performance in the presence of noises. Critically, scGCO scales near linearly with inputs and demonstrates orders of magnitude better running time and memory requirement than existing methods, and could represent a valuable solution when spatial transcriptomics data grows into millions of data points and beyond.","Single-cell gene expression data with positional information is critical to dissect mechanisms and architectures of multicellular organisms, but the potential is limited by the scalability of current data analysis strategies.

85,Modeling human HSV infection via a vascularized immune-competent skin-on-chip platform,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) naturally infects skin and mucosal surfaces, causing lifelong recurrent disease worldwide, with no cure or vaccine. Biomimetic human tissue and organ platforms provide attractive alternatives over animal models to recapitulate human diseases. Combining prevascularization and microfluidic approaches, we present a vascularized, three-dimensional skin-on-chip that mimics human skin architecture and is competent to immune-cell and drug perfusion. The endothelialized microvasculature embedded in a fibroblast-containing dermis responds to biological stimulation, while the cornified epidermis functions as a protective barrier. HSV infection of the skin-on-chip displays tissue-level key morphological and pathophysiological features typical of genital herpes infection in humans, including the production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-8, which triggers rapid neutrophil trans-endothelial extravasation and directional migration. Importantly, perfusion with the antiviral drug acyclovir inhibits HSV infection in a dose-dependent and time-sensitive manner. Thus, our vascularized skin-on-chip represents a promising platform for human HSV disease modeling and preclinical therapeutic evaluation.",Understanding host responses to Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in humans is challenging.

86,Structural characterization of a soil viral auxiliary metabolic gene product – a functional chitosanase,"Metagenomics is unearthing the previously hidden world of soil viruses. Many soil viral sequences in metagenomes contain putative auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) that are not associated with viral replication. Here, we establish that AMGs on soil viruses actually produce functional, active proteins. We focus on AMGs that potentially encode chitosanase enzymes that metabolize chitin – a common carbon polymer. We express and functionally screen several chitosanase genes identified from environmental metagenomes. One expressed protein showing endo-chitosanase activity (V-Csn) is crystalized and structurally characterized at ultra-high resolution, thus representing the structure of a soil viral AMG product. This structure provides details about the active site, and together with structure models determined using AlphaFold, facilitates understanding of substrate specificity and enzyme mechanism. Our findings support the hypothesis that soil viruses contribute auxiliary functions to their hosts.","Metagenomics is revealing auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) in soil viral genomes. Here, authors solve the crystal structure for a soil viral AMG product, free and ligand bound, and show the protein can decompose chitin, a common carbon polymer.",2022-09-19
87,A unifying mechanism for cation effect modulating C1 and C2 productions from CO2 electroreduction,"Electrocatalysis, whose reaction venue locates at the catalyst–electrolyte interface, is controlled by the electron transfer across the electric double layer, envisaging a mechanistic link between the electron transfer rate and the electric double layer structure. A fine example is in the CO2 reduction reaction, of which rate shows a strong dependence on the alkali metal cation (M+) identity, but there is yet to be a unified molecular picture for that. Using quantum-mechanics-based atom-scale simulation, we herein scrutinize the M+-coupling capability to possible intermediates, and establish H+- and M+-associated ET mechanisms for CH4 and CO/C2H4 formations, respectively. These theoretical scenarios are successfully underpinned by Nernstian shifts of polarization curves with the H+ or M+ concentrations and the first-order kinetics of CO/C2H4 formation on the electrode surface charge density. Our finding further rationalizes the merit of using Nafion-coated electrode for enhanced C2 production in terms of enhanced surface charge density.","CO2 reduction rate shows a strong dependence on alkali metal cation identity but a unified molecular picture for underlying mechanism requires further investigation. Using advanced molecular simulations and experimental kinetic studies, here the authors establish a unified mechanism for cation-coupled electron transfer.",2022-09-19
88,Mutated processes predict immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy benefit in metastatic melanoma,"Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) therapy has revolutionized treatment for advanced melanoma; however, only a subset of patients benefit from this treatment. Despite considerable efforts, the Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) is the only FDA-approved biomarker in melanoma. However, the mechanisms underlying TMB association with prolonged ICI survival are not entirely understood and may depend on numerous confounding factors. To identify more interpretable ICI response biomarkers based on tumor mutations, we train classifiers using mutations within distinct biological processes. We evaluate a variety of feature selection and classification methods and identify key mutated biological processes that provide improved predictive capability compared to the TMB. The top mutated processes we identify are leukocyte and T-cell proliferation regulation, which demonstrate stable predictive performance across different data cohorts of melanoma patients treated with ICI. This study provides biologically interpretable genomic predictors of ICI response with substantially improved predictive performance over the TMB.","Tumour mutational burden is a biomarker of immune checkpoint inhibitor response, but their association is not fully understood. Here, the authors train classifiers to identify key mutated processes which show stable predictive performance in multiple melanoma cohorts.",2022-09-19
89,Machine learning-based tsunami inundation prediction derived from offshore observations,"The world’s largest and densest tsunami observing system gives us the leverage to develop a method for a real-time tsunami inundation prediction based on machine learning. Our method utilizes 150 offshore stations encompassing the Japan Trench to simultaneously predict tsunami inundation at seven coastal cities stretching ~100 km along the southern Sanriku coast. We trained the model using 3093 hypothetical tsunami scenarios from the megathrust (Mw 8.0–9.1) and nearby outer-rise (Mw 7.0–8.7) earthquakes. Then, the model was tested against 480 unseen scenarios and three near-field historical tsunami events. The proposed machine learning-based model can achieve comparable accuracy to the physics-based model with ~99% computational cost reduction, thus facilitates a rapid prediction and an efficient uncertainty quantification. Additionally, the direct use of offshore observations can increase the forecast lead time and eliminate the uncertainties typically associated with a tsunami source estimate required by the conventional modeling approach.","One of the main challenges in the tsunami inundation prediction is related to the real-time computational efforts done under restrictive time constraints. Here the authors show that using machine learning-based model, we can achieve comparable accuracy to the physics-based model with ~99% computational cost reduction.",2022-09-19
90,Three learning stages and accuracy–efficiency tradeoff of restricted Boltzmann machines,"Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) offer a versatile architecture for unsupervised machine learning that can in principle approximate any target probability distribution with arbitrary accuracy. However, the RBM model is usually not directly accessible due to its computational complexity, and Markov-chain sampling is invoked to analyze the learned probability distribution. For training and eventual applications, it is thus desirable to have a sampler that is both accurate and efficient. We highlight that these two goals generally compete with each other and cannot be achieved simultaneously. More specifically, we identify and quantitatively characterize three regimes of RBM learning: independent learning, where the accuracy improves without losing efficiency; correlation learning, where higher accuracy entails lower efficiency; and degradation, where both accuracy and efficiency no longer improve or even deteriorate. These findings are based on numerical experiments and heuristic arguments.",Restricted Boltzmann Machines are unsupervised machine learning model that have been applied for various tasks from image analysis to many-body physics. The authors elaborate the interplay of accuracy and efficiency of this model and define possible balance regimes for applications.,2022-09-17
91,Quantitative fragmentomics allow affinity mapping of interactomes,"Human protein networks have been widely explored but most binding affinities remain unknown, hindering quantitative interactome-function studies. Yet interactomes rely on minimal interacting fragments displaying quantifiable affinities. Here, we measure the affinities of 65,000 interactions involving PDZ domains and their target PDZ-binding motifs (PBM) within a human interactome region particularly relevant for viral infection and cancer. We calculate interactomic distances, identify hot spots for viral interference, generate binding profiles and specificity logos, and explain selected cases by crystallographic studies. Mass spectrometry experiments on cell extracts and literature surveys show that quantitative fragmentomics effectively complements protein interactomics by providing affinities and completeness of coverage, putting a full human interactome affinity survey within reach. Finally, we show that interactome hijacking by the viral PBM of human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein substantially impacts the host cell proteome beyond immediate E6 binders, illustrating the complex system-wide relationship between interactome and function.","Protein networks have been widely explored but most binding affinities remain unknown, limiting the quantitative interpretation of interactomes.

92,Leakage does not fully offset soy supply-chain efforts to reduce deforestation in Brazil,"Zero-deforestation supply chain policies that leverage the market power of commodity buyers to change agricultural producer behavior can reduce forest clearing in regions with rapid commodity expansion and weak forest governance. Yet leakage—when deforestation is pushed to other regions—may dilute the global effectiveness of regionally successful policies. Here we show that domestic leakage offsets 43-50% of the avoided deforestation induced by existing and proposed zero-deforestation supply chain policies in Brazil’s soy sector. However, cross-border leakage is insignificant (<3%) because soybean production is displaced to existing U.S. farmland. Eliminating deforestation from the supply chains of all firms exporting Brazilian soy to the EU or China from 2011-2016 could have reduced net global deforestation by 2% and Brazilian deforestation by 9%. Thus, if major tropical commodity importers (e.g., the EU) require traders to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains, it could help bend the curve on global forest loss.","This research quantifies the role of zero deforestation policies and potential leakages in Brazilian soybean production, the third major driver of deforestation globally. Here the authors provide the first estimates of net global avoided soy-driven deforestation from zero-deforestation import restrictions and find that such restrictions could help avoid ~40% of deforestation for soy cultivation in Brazil and ~2% of global deforestation.",2022-09-17
93,Main-chain engineering of polymer photocatalysts with hydrophilic non-conjugated segments for visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution,"Photocatalytic water splitting is attracting considerable interest because it enables the conversion of solar energy into hydrogen for use as a zero-emission fuel or chemical feedstock. Herein, we present a universal approach for inserting hydrophilic non-conjugated segments into the main-chain of conjugated polymers to produce a series of discontinuously conjugated polymer photocatalysts. Water can effectively be brought into the interior through these hydrophilic non-conjugated segments, resulting in effective water/polymer interfaces inside the bulk discontinuously conjugated polymers in both thin-film and solution. Discontinuously conjugated polymer with 10 mol% hexaethylene glycol-based hydrophilic segments achieves an apparent quantum yield of 17.82% under 460 nm monochromatic light irradiation in solution and a hydrogen evolution rate of 16.8 mmol m−2 h−1 in thin-film. Molecular dynamics simulations show a trend similar to that in experiments, corroborating that main-chain engineering increases the possibility of a water/polymer interaction. By introducing non-conjugated hydrophilic segments, the effective conjugation length is not altered, allowing discontinuously conjugated polymers to remain efficient photocatalysis.","The introduction of hydrophilic segments into the main-chain of polymer photocatalysts allows water to efficiently enter the interior through these hydrophilic segments, and results in effective water/polymer interfaces for hydrogen evolution.",2022-09-17
94,A self-assembled trimeric protein vaccine induces protective immunity against Omicron variant,"The recently emerged Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has rapidly surpassed Delta to become the predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant, given the higher transmissibility rate and immune escape ability, resulting in breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. A new generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines targeting the Omicron variant are urgently needed. Here, we developed a subunit vaccine named RBD-HR/trimer by directly linking the sequence of RBD derived from the Delta variant (containing L452R and T478K) and HR1 and HR2 in SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit in a tandem manner, which can self-assemble into a trimer. In multiple animal models, vaccination of RBD-HR/trimer formulated with MF59-like oil-in-water adjuvant elicited sustained humoral immune response with high levels of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against Omicron variants, also inducing a strong T cell immune response in vivo. In addition, our RBD-HR/trimer vaccine showed a strong boosting effect against Omicron variants after two doses of mRNA vaccines, featuring its capacity to be used in a prime-boost regimen. In mice and non-human primates, RBD-HR/trimer vaccination could confer a complete protection against live virus challenge of Omicron and Delta variants. The results qualified RBD-HR/trimer vaccine as a promising next-generation vaccine candidate for prevention of SARS-CoV-2, which deserved further evaluation in clinical trials.","The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has quickly become the predominant circulating variant, due to the high transmissibility and immune escape.

95,Single-cell transcriptomics reveal cellular diversity of aortic valve and the immunomodulation by PPARγ during hyperlipidemia,"Valvular inflammation triggered by hyperlipidemia has been considered as an important initial process of aortic valve disease; however, cellular and molecular evidence remains unclear. Here, we assess the relationship between plasma lipids and valvular inflammation, and identify association of low-density lipoprotein with increased valvular lipid and macrophage accumulation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals the cellular heterogeneity of leukocytes, valvular interstitial cells, and valvular endothelial cells, and their phenotypic changes during hyperlipidemia leading to recruitment of monocyte-derived MHC-IIhi macrophages. Interestingly, we find activated PPARγ pathway in Cd36+ valvular endothelial cells increased in hyperlipidemic mice, and the conservation of PPARγ activation in non-calcified human aortic valves. While the PPARγ inhibition promotes inflammation, PPARγ activation using pioglitazone reduces valvular inflammation in hyperlipidemic mice. These results show that low-density lipoprotein is the main lipoprotein accumulated in the aortic valve during hyperlipidemia, leading to early-stage aortic valve disease, and PPARγ activation protects the aortic valve against inflammation.",Identifying the mechanisms underlying the early inflammatory phase of aortic valve disease is crucial for disease prevention. Here the authors perform single-cell RNA sequencing to show the immunomodulatory role of PPARγ in valvular endothelial cells during hyperlipidemia.,2022-09-17
96,Phylogeographic analysis reveals an ancient East African origin of human herpes simplex virus 2 dispersal out-of-Africa,"Human herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is a ubiquitous, slowly evolving DNA virus. HSV-2 has two primary lineages, one found in West and Central Africa and the other found worldwide. Competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain how HSV-2 migrated out-of-Africa (i)HSV-2 followed human migration out-of-Africa 50-100 thousand years ago, or (ii)HSV-2 migrated via the trans-Atlantic slave trade 150-500 years ago. Limited geographic sampling and lack of molecular clock signal has precluded robust comparison. Here, we analyze newly sequenced HSV-2 genomes from Africa to resolve geography and timing of divergence events within HSV-2. Phylogeographic analysis consistently places the ancestor of worldwide dispersal in East Africa, though molecular clock is too slow to be detected using available data. Rates 4.2 × 10−8−5.6 × 10−8 substitutions/site/year, consistent with previous age estimates, suggest a worldwide dispersal 22-29 thousand years ago. Thus, HSV-2 likely migrated with humans from East Africa and dispersed after the Last Glacial Maximum.","There are competing hypotheses for human herpes simplex virus 2’s migration out-of-Africa. Here, the authors sequence 65 new herpes simplex virus 2 genomes with a focus on under-sampled sub-Saharan African countries, suggesting an Eastern African origin for global dispersal the virus between 22-29 thousand years ago.",2022-09-17
97,Infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex signalling to calbindin 1 positive neurons in posterior basolateral amygdala suppresses anxiety- and depression-like behaviours,"Generalization is a fundamental cognitive ability of organisms to deal with the uncertainty in real-world situations. Excessive fear generalization and impaired reward generalization are closely related to many psychiatric disorders. However, the neural circuit mechanism for reward generalization and its role in anxiety-like behaviours remain elusive. Here, we found a robust activation of calbindin 1-neurons (Calb 1) in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA), simultaneous with reward generalization to an ambiguous cue after reward conditioning in mice. We identify the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL) to the pBLACalb1 (Calb 1 neurons in the pBLA) pathway as being involved in reward generalization for the ambiguity. Activating IL–pBLA inputs strengthens reward generalization and reduces chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in a manner dependent on pBLACalb1 neuron activation. These findings suggest that the IL–pBLACalb1 circuit could be a target to promote stress resilience via reward generalization and consequently ameliorate anxiety- and depression-like behaviours.",The neural mechanisms for reward generalization are not fully understood. Here the authors investigate the role of posterior basolateral amygdala calbindin-expressing cells in modulating behavioural responses related to reward and aversion.,2022-09-17
98,Dislocation exhaustion and ultra-hardening of nanograined metals by phase transformation at grain boundaries,"The development of high-strength metals has driven the endeavor of pushing the limit of grain size (d) reduction according to the Hall-Petch law. But the continuous grain refinement is particularly challenging, raising also the problem of inverse Hall-Petch effect. Here, we show that the nanograined metals (NMs) with d of tens of nanometers could be strengthened to the level comparable to or even beyond that of the extremely-fine NMs (d ~ 5 nm) attributing to the dislocation exhaustion. We design the Fe-Ni NM with intergranular Ni enrichment. The results show triggering of structural transformation at grain boundaries (GBs) at low temperature, which consumes lattice dislocations significantly. Therefore, the plasticity in the dislocation-exhausted NMs is suggested to be dominated by the activation of GB dislocation sources, leading to the ultra-hardening effect. This approach demonstrates a new pathway to explore NMs with desired properties by tailoring phase transformations via GB physico-chemical engineering.","Strengthening of metals by grain refinement is limited by the inverse Hall-Petch effect. Here, the authors show nanograined metals can be strengthened by exhausting lattice dislocations via triggering of phase transformation at grain boundaries, instead of further grain refinement.",2022-09-17
99,Scaling behavior of electron decoherence in a graphene Mach-Zehnder interferometer,"Over the past 20 years, many efforts have been made to understand and control decoherence in 2D electron systems. In particular, several types of electronic interferometers have been considered in GaAs heterostructures, in order to protect the interfering electrons from decoherence. Nevertheless, it is now understood that several intrinsic decoherence sources fundamentally limit more advanced quantum manipulations. Here, we show that graphene offers a unique possibility to reach a regime where the decoherence is frozen and to study unexplored regimes of electron interferometry. We probe the decoherence of electron channels in a graphene quantum Hall PN junction, forming a Mach-Zehnder interferometer1,2, and unveil a scaling behavior of decay of the interference visibility with the temperature scaled by the interferometer length. It exhibits a remarkable crossover from an exponential decay at higher temperature to an algebraic decay at lower temperature where almost no decoherence occurs, a regime previously unobserved in GaAs interferometers.","Quantum Hall edge channels provide a platform to study electron interference, however understanding decoherence in these systems remains an open problem. Jo et al. realize a regime of suppressed decoherence in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer formed in a graphene quantum Hall pn junction.",2022-09-17

We reported early immunogenicity and safety outcomes of heterologous immunization with a viral vector vaccine (ChAdOx1) and a spike-2P subunit vaccine (MVC-COV1901) in a participant-blinded, randomized, non-inferiority trial (NCT05054621). A total of 100 healthy adults aged 20–70 years having the first dose of ChAdOx1 were 1:1 randomly assigned to receive a booster dose either with ChAdOx1 (n = 50) or MVC-COV1901 (n = 50) at an interval of 4–6 or 8–10 weeks. At day 28 post-boosting, the neutralizing antibody geometric mean titer against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in MVC-COV1901 recipients (236 IU/mL) was superior to that in ChAdOx1 recipients (115 IU/mL), with a GMT ratio of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.9). Superiority in the neutralizing antibody titer against Delta variant was also found for heterologous MVC-COV1901 immunization with a GMT ratio of 2.6 (95% CI, 1.8 to 3.8). Both spike-specific antibody-secreting B and T cell responses were substantially enhanced by the heterologous schedule. Heterologous boosting was particularly prominent at a short prime-boost interval. No serious adverse events occurred across all groups. The findings support the use of heterologous prime-boost with ChAdOx1 and protein-based subunit vaccines.","Public safety concern of the ChAdOx1 vaccine has led to an alternative immunisation strategy against SARS-CoV-2, with this heterologous schedule widely adopted and officially recommended in many countries.

101,Pt1 enhanced C-H activation synergistic with Ptn catalysis for glycerol cascade oxidation to glyceric acid,"The selective oxidation of glycerol to glyceric acid, an important value-added reaction from polyols, is a typical cascade catalytic process. It is still of great challenge to simultaneously achieve high glycerol activity and glyceric acid selectivity, suffering from either deep oxidation and C-C cleavage or poor oxidation efficiency from glyceraldehyde to glyceric acid. Herein, this work, inspired by nature, proposes a cascade synergistic catalysis strategy by atomic and low-coordinated cluster Pt on well-defined Cu-CuZrOx, which involves enhanced C-H activation on atomic Pt1 and O-H activation on cluster Ptn in the oxidation of glycerol to glyceraldehyde, and cluster Ptn for C=O activation followed by O-H insertion and atomic Pt1 for C-H activation in the tandem oxidation of glyceraldehyde to glyceric acid. The enhanced C-H activation in the cascade process by atomic Pt1 is revealed to be essential for the high glycerol activity (90.0±0.1%) and the glyceric acid selectivity (80.2±0.2%).",The selective oxidation of glycerol to glyceric acid is an important value-added cascade catalytic process. Here the authors report a cascade synergistic catalysis strategy by atomic and low-coordinated cluster Pt on well-defined Cu-CuZrOx to simultaneously achieve high activity and selectivity.,2022-09-17
102,Structural mechanism of tapasin-mediated MHC-I peptide loading in antigen presentation,"Loading of MHC-I molecules with peptide by the catalytic chaperone tapasin in the peptide loading complex plays a critical role in antigen presentation and immune recognition. Mechanistic insight has been hampered by the lack of detailed structural information concerning tapasin–MHC-I. We present here crystal structures of human tapasin complexed with the MHC-I molecule HLA-B*44:05, and with each of two anti-tapasin antibodies. The tapasin-stabilized peptide-receptive state of HLA-B*44:05 is characterized by distortion of the peptide binding groove and destabilization of the β2-microglobulin interaction, leading to release of peptide. Movements of the membrane proximal Ig-like domains of tapasin, HLA-B*44:05, and β2-microglobulin accompany the transition to a peptide-receptive state. Together this ensemble of crystal structures provides insights into a distinct mechanism of tapasin-mediated peptide exchange.","The catalytic chaperone tapasin assists peptide loading onto MHC-I molecules for antigen presentation and immune recognition. Here, the authors present crystal structures that provide insights into the molecular mechanism of tapasin-mediated peptide exchange.",2022-09-17
103,Spatio-temporal analysis of prostate tumors in situ suggests pre-existence of treatment-resistant clones,"The molecular mechanisms underlying lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer remain poorly understood, with intratumoral heterogeneity a likely contributing factor. To examine the temporal aspects of resistance, we analyze tumor heterogeneity in needle biopsies collected before and after treatment with androgen deprivation therapy. By doing so, we are able to couple clinical responsiveness and morphological information such as Gleason score to transcriptome-wide data. Our data-driven analysis of transcriptomes identifies several distinct intratumoral cell populations, characterized by their unique gene expression profiles. Certain cell populations present before treatment exhibit gene expression profiles that match those of resistant tumor cell clusters, present after treatment. We confirm that these clusters are resistant by the localization of active androgen receptors to the nuclei in cancer cells post-treatment. Our data also demonstrates that most stromal cells adjacent to resistant clusters do not express the androgen receptor, and we identify differentially expressed genes for these cells. Altogether, this study shows the potential to increase the power in predicting resistant tumors.","Spatial heterogeneity in prostate cancer can contribute to its resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Here, the authors analyse prostate cancer samples before and after ADT using Spatial Transcriptomics, and find heterogeneous pre-treatment tumour cell populations and stromal cells that are associated with resistance.",2022-09-17
104,Mechanistic understanding of human SLFN11,"Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) is an interferon-inducible antiviral restriction factor with tRNA endoribonuclease and DNA binding functions. It is recruited to stalled replication forks in response to replication stress and inhibits replication of certain viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) by modulating the tRNA pool. SLFN11 has been identified as a predictive biomarker in cancer, as its expression correlates with a beneficial response to DNA damage inducing anticancer drugs. However, the mechanism and interdependence of these two functions are largely unknown. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human SLFN11 in its dimeric apoenzyme state, bound to tRNA and in complex with single-strand DNA. Full-length SLFN11 neither hydrolyses nor binds ATP and the helicase domain appears in an autoinhibited state. Together with biochemical and structure guided mutagenesis studies, our data give detailed insights into the mechanism of endoribonuclease activity as well as suggestions on how SLFN11 may block stressed replication forks.","Schlafen 11 serves as an antiviral restriction factor and a predictive biomarker in cancer. Here, the authors use cryoelectron microscopy and biochemical assays to understand tRNA endoribonuclease and DNA binding functions of human Schlafen 11.",2022-09-17
105,Mechanism of C-N bonds formation in electrocatalytic urea production revealed by ab initio molecular dynamics simulation,"Electrosynthesis of urea from CO2 and NOX provides an exceptional opportunity for human society, given the increasingly available renewable energy. Urea electrosynthesis is challenging. In order to raise the overall electrosynthesis efficiency, the most critical reaction step for such electrosynthesis, C-N coupling, needs to be significantly improved. The C-N coupling can only happen at a narrow potential window, generally in the low overpotential region, and a fundamental understanding of the C-N coupling is needed for further development of this strategy. In this regard, we perform ab initio Molecular Dynamics simulations to reveal the origin of C-N coupling under a small electrode potential window with both the dynamic nature of water as a solvent, and the electrode potentials considered. We explore the key reaction networks for urea formation on Cu(100) surface in neutral electrolytes. Our work shows excellent agreement with experimentally observed selectivity under different potentials on the Cu electrode. We discover that the *NH and *CO are the key precursors for C-N bonds formation at low overpotential, while at high overpotential the C-N coupling occurs between adsorbed *NH and solvated CO. These insights provide vital information for future spectroscopic measurements and enable us to design new electrochemical systems for more value-added chemicals.",Urea electrosyntehsis from CO2 and NOx is a challenging reaction that is becoming increasingly important.

106,Insight into the transient inactivation effect on Au/TiO2 catalyst by in-situ DRIFT and UV–vis spectroscopy,"Au catalysts have drawn broad attention for catalytic CO oxidation. However, a molecular-level understanding of the reaction mechanism on a fast time-resolved scale is still lacking. Herein, we apply in situ DRIFTS and UV-Vis spectroscopy to monitor the rapid dynamic changes during CO oxidation over Au/TiO2. A pronounced transient inactivation effect likely due to a structural change of Au/TiO2 induced by the reactants (CO and O2) is observed at the beginning of the reaction. The transient inactivation effect is affected by the ratio of CO and O2 concentrations. More importantly, during the unstable state, the electronic properties of the Au particles change, as indicated by the shift of the CO stretching vibration. UV-Vis spectroscopy corroborates the structure change of Au/TiO2 surface induced by the reactants, which leads to a weakening of the Au catalyst’s ability to be oxidized (less O2 adsorption), resulting in the transient inactivation effect.","A molecular-level understanding of the Au-catalyzed CO oxidation on a fast time-resolved scale is still lacking. Here the authors monitor the rapid dynamic changes during CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 using in situ DRIFTS and UV-Vis spectroscopy, and reveal that the catalyst undergoes a surprising structural change at the beginning of the reaction.",2022-09-17
107,The immune landscape of human thymic epithelial tumors,"Human thymic epithelial tumors (TET) are common malignancies in the anterior mediastinum with limited biological understanding. Here we show, by single cell analysis of the immune landscape, that the developmental pattern of intra-tumoral T-cells identify three types within TETs. We characterize the developmental alterations and TCR repertoires of tumor-infiltrating T cells in the context of the distinguishing epithelial tumor cell types. We demonstrate that a subset of tumor cells, featuring medullary thymic epithelial cell (TEC) phenotype and marked by KRT14/GNB3 expression, accumulate in type 1 TETs, while T-cell positive selection is inhibited. Type 2 TETs are dominated by CCL25+ cortical TEC-like cells that appear to promote T-cell positive selection. Interestingly, the CHI3L1+ medullary TEC-like cells that are the characteristic feature of type 3 TETs don’t seem to support T-cell development, however, they may induce a tissue-resident CD8+ T cell response. In summary, our work suggests that the molecular subtype of epithelial tumour cells in TETs determine their tumour immune microenvironment, thus GNB3 and CHI3L1 might predict the immunological behavior and hence prognosis of these tumours.","Thymic epithelial tumours represent a heterogenous group of malignancies with varied immune cell infiltration and prognosis. Here authors systematically analyze the phenotypes of both epithelial and immune cells that form these tumours, and identify three major subtypes with different T cell involvement that might affect prognosis.",2022-09-17
108,Oncogenic RAS commandeers amino acid sensing machinery to aberrantly activate mTORC1 in multiple myeloma,"Oncogenic RAS mutations are common in multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable malignancy of plasma cells. However, the mechanisms of pathogenic RAS signaling in this disease remain enigmatic and difficult to inhibit therapeutically. We employ an unbiased proteogenomic approach to dissect RAS signaling in MM. We discover that mutant isoforms of RAS organize a signaling complex with the amino acid transporter, SLC3A2, and MTOR on endolysosomes, which directly activates mTORC1 by co-opting amino acid sensing pathways. MM tumors with high expression of mTORC1-dependent genes are more aggressive and enriched in RAS mutations, and we detect interactions between RAS and MTOR in MM patient tumors harboring mutant RAS isoforms. Inhibition of RAS-dependent mTORC1 activity synergizes with MEK and ERK inhibitors to quench pathogenic RAS signaling in MM cells. This study redefines the RAS pathway in MM and provides a mechanistic and rational basis to target this mode of RAS signaling.","RAS mutations are commonly found in multiple myeloma (MM). Here, the authors show that oncogenic RAS mutations activate mTORC1 signalling in MM and combining mTORC1 and MEK/ERK inhibitors synergize to improve survival in preclinical models.",2022-09-17
109,Growth of bilayer MoTe2 single crystals with strong non-linear Hall effect,"The reduced symmetry in strong spin-orbit coupling materials such as transition metal ditellurides (TMDTs) gives rise to non-trivial topology, unique spin texture, and large charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies. Bilayer TMDTs are non-centrosymmetric and have unique topological properties compared to monolayer or trilayer, but a controllable way to prepare bilayer MoTe2 crystal has not been achieved to date. Herein, we achieve the layer-by-layer growth of large-area bilayer and trilayer 1T′ MoTe2 single crystals and centimetre-scale films by a two-stage chemical vapor deposition process. The as-grown bilayer MoTe2 shows out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization, whereas the monolayer and trilayer crystals are non-polar. In addition, we observed large in-plane nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect for the bilayer and trilayer Td phase MoTe2 under time reversal-symmetric conditions, while these vanish for thicker layers. For a fixed input current, bilayer Td MoTe2 produces the largest second harmonic output voltage among the thicker crystals tested. Our work therefore highlights the importance of thickness-dependent Berry curvature effects in TMDTs that are underscored by the ability to grow thickness-precise layers.","2D transition metal ditellurides exhibit nontrivial topological phases, but the controlled bottom-up synthesis of these materials is still challenging. Here, the authors report the layer-by-layer growth of large-area bilayer and trilayer 1T’ MoTe2 films, showing thickness-dependent ferroelectricity and nonlinear Hall effect.",2022-09-17
110,"Thermal coupling of the Indo-Pacific warm pool and Southern Ocean over the past 30,000 years","The role of the tropical Pacific Ocean and its linkages to the southern hemisphere during the last deglacial warming remain highly controversial. Here we explore the evolution of Pacific horizontal and vertical thermal gradients over the past 30 kyr by compiling 340 sea surface and 7 subsurface temperature records, as well as one new ocean heat content record. Our records reveal that La Niña-like conditions dominated during the deglaciation as a result of the more intense warming in the western Pacific warm pool. Both the subsurface temperature and ocean heat content in the warm pool rose earlier than the sea surface temperature, and in phase with South Pacific subsurface temperature and orbital precession, implying that heat exchange between the tropical upper water column and the extratropical Southern Ocean facilitated faster warming in the western Pacific. Our study underscores the key role of the thermal coupling between the warm pool and the Southern Ocean and its relevance for future global warming.","The mechanism of the last deglacial global warming is key for future climate. Here, the authors shed light on the pivotal role of the thermal coupling between the western Pacific warm pool and the Southern Ocean.",2022-09-17
111,Electrosynthesis of formamide from methanol and ammonia under ambient conditions,"Electrochemical conversion of abundant carbon- and nitrogen-containing small molecules into high-valued organonitrogen compounds is alluring to reducing current dependence on fossil energy. Here we report a single-cell electrochemical oxidation approach to transform methanol and ammonia into formamide under ambient conditions over Pt electrocatalyst that provides 74.26% selectivity from methanol to formamide and a Faradaic efficiency of 40.39% at 100 mA cm−2 current density, gaining an economic advantage over conventional manufacturing based on techno-economic analysis. A 46-h continuous test performed in the flow cell shows no performance decay. The combined results of in situ experiments and theoretical simulations unveil the C–N bond formation mechanism via nucleophilic attack of NH3 on an aldehyde-like intermediate derived from methanol electrooxidation. This work offers a way to synthesize formamide via C–N coupling and can be extended to substantially synthesize other value-added organonitrogen chemicals (e.g., acetamide, propenamide, formyl methylamine).",Developing a sustainable manufacturing method using biomass-derived feedstock at ambient conditions is highly desirable.

112,A temporal sequence of thalamic activity unfolds at transitions in behavioral arousal state,"Awakening from sleep reflects a profound transformation in neural activity and behavior. The thalamus is a key controller of arousal state, but whether its diverse nuclei exhibit coordinated or distinct activity at transitions in behavioral arousal state is unknown. Using fast fMRI at ultra-high field (7 Tesla), we measured sub-second activity across thalamocortical networks and within nine thalamic nuclei to delineate these dynamics during spontaneous transitions in behavioral arousal state. We discovered a stereotyped sequence of activity across thalamic nuclei and cingulate cortex that preceded behavioral arousal after a period of inactivity, followed by widespread deactivation. These thalamic dynamics were linked to whether participants subsequently fell back into unresponsiveness, with unified thalamic activation reflecting maintenance of behavior. These results provide an outline of the complex interactions across thalamocortical circuits that orchestrate behavioral arousal state transitions, and additionally, demonstrate that fast fMRI can resolve sub-second subcortical dynamics in the human brain.","How the brain transitions between sleep and wakefulness is not well understood. Here, the authors discover that a sequence of activity unfolds across the thalamus before transitions from unresponsiveness to active behavior.",2022-09-16
113,Structure-based discovery of small molecules that disaggregate Alzheimer’s disease tissue derived tau fibrils in vitro,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the consequence of neuronal death and brain atrophy associated with the aggregation of protein tau into fibrils. Thus disaggregation of tau fibrils could be a therapeutic approach to AD. The small molecule EGCG, abundant in green tea, has long been known to disaggregate tau and other amyloid fibrils, but EGCG has poor drug-like properties, failing to fully penetrate the brain. Here we have cryogenically trapped an intermediate of brain-extracted tau fibrils on the kinetic pathway to EGCG-induced disaggregation and have determined its cryoEM structure. The structure reveals that EGCG molecules stack in polar clefts between the paired helical protofilaments that pathologically define AD. Treating the EGCG binding position as a pharmacophore, we computationally screened thousands of drug-like compounds for compatibility for the pharmacophore, discovering several that experimentally disaggregate brain-derived tau fibrils in vitro. This work suggests the potential of structure-based, small-molecule drug discovery for amyloid diseases.","Evidence suggests that fibrous aggregates of protein tau may be the proximal cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, using atomic structures of tau fibrils from brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, the authors have found small-molecule drug leads that disaggregate tau fibrils in vitro.",2022-09-16
114,Imprinting fidelity in mouse iPSCs depends on sex of donor cell and medium formulation,"Reprogramming of somatic cells into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) is a major leap towards personalised approaches to disease modelling and cell-replacement therapies. However, we still lack the ability to fully control the epigenetic status of iPSCs, which is a major hurdle for their downstream applications. Epigenetic fidelity can be tracked by genomic imprinting, a phenomenon dependent on DNA methylation, which is frequently perturbed in iPSCs by yet unknown reasons. To try to understand the causes underlying these defects, we conducted a thorough imprinting analysis using IMPLICON, a high-throughput method measuring DNA methylation levels, in multiple female and male murine iPSC lines generated under different experimental conditions. Our results show that imprinting defects are remarkably common in iPSCs, but their nature depends on the sex of donor cells and their response to culture conditions. Imprints in female iPSCs resist the initial genome-wide DNA demethylation wave during reprogramming, but ultimately cells accumulate hypomethylation defects irrespective of culture medium formulations. In contrast, imprinting defects on male iPSCs depends on the experimental conditions and arise during reprogramming, being mitigated by the addition of vitamin C (VitC). Our findings are fundamental to further optimise reprogramming strategies and generate iPSCs with a stable epigenome.",Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is associated with epigenetic alterations. Here the authors assess DNA methylation in detail in multiple female and male mouse iPSC lines generated with different protocols and find that defects depend on the sex of donor cells and can be partially mitigated by Vitamin C.,2022-09-16
115,"Synthesis, properties, and material hybridization of bare aromatic polymers enabled by dendrimer support","Aromatic polymers are the first-choice platform for current organic materials due to their distinct optical, electronic, and mechanical properties as well as their biocompatibility. However, bare aromatic polymer backbones tend to strongly aggregate, rendering them essentially insoluble in organic solvent. While the typical solution is to install many solubilizing substituents on the backbones, this often provokes undesired property changes. Herein, we report the synthesis of bare aromatic polymers enabled by a dendrimer support. An initiator arene containing a diterpenoid-based dendrimer undergoes Pd-catalyzed polymerization with monomers bearing no solubilizing substituents to furnish bare aromatic polymers such as polythiophenes and poly(para-phenylene)s. The high solubility of dendrimer-ligated polymers allows not only the unveiling of the properties of unsubstituted π-conjugated backbone, but also mild release of dendrimer-free aromatic polymers and even transfer of aromatic polymers to other materials, such as silica gel and protein, which may accelerate the creation of hybrid materials nowadays challenging to access.","Unsubstituted aromatic polymers are materials with multiple potential applications, but their preparation remains challenging. Here, the authors report a dendrimer-enabled synthesis of soluble bare aromatic polymers and explore their properties; these compounds can be further transformed into other materials.",2022-09-16
116,Electrostatic and steric effects underlie acetylation-induced changes in ubiquitin structure and function,"Covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) to proteins is a highly versatile posttranslational modification. Moreover, Ub is not only a modifier but itself is modified by phosphorylation and lysine acetylation. However, the functional consequences of Ub acetylation are poorly understood. By generation and comprehensive characterization of all seven possible mono-acetylated Ub variants, we show that each acetylation site has a particular impact on Ub structure. This is reflected in selective usage of the acetylated variants by different E3 ligases and overlapping but distinct interactomes, linking different acetylated variants to different cellular pathways. Notably, not only electrostatic but also steric effects contribute to acetylation-induced changes in Ub structure and, thus, function. Finally, we provide evidence that p300 acts as a position-specific Ub acetyltransferase and HDAC6 as a general Ub deacetylase. Our findings provide intimate insights into the structural and functional consequences of Ub acetylation and highlight the general importance of Ub acetylation.","Ubiquitin is not only a posttranslational modifier but itself is subject to modifications, such as acetylation. Characterization of distinct acetylated ubiquitin variants reveals that each acetylation site has a particular impact on ubiquitin structure and its protein-protein interaction properties.",2022-09-16
117,Enzymatic synthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids using a parallel cascade strategy and tyrosinase variants,"Benzylisoquinoline alkaloid derived pharmaceuticals are widely applied in modern medicines. Recent studies on the microbial production of benzylisoquinolines have highlighted key biological syntheses towards these natural products. Routes to non-natural benzylisoquinolines have been less explored, particularly halogenated compounds which are more challenging. Here, we show the use of a tyrosinase, tyrosine decarboxylase, transaminase, and norcoclaurine synthase which are combined in a parallel cascade design, in order to generate halogenated benzylisoquinoline alkaloids in high enantiomeric excess. Notably, mutagenesis studies are applied to generate tyrosinase mutants, which enhance the acceptance of halogenated tyrosines for use in the biocatalytic cascades developed.","Pharmaceuticals derived from benzylisoquinoline alkaloids find application in modern medicine. Here, the authors report the design of a parallel enzymatic cascade to generate halogenated benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, that included engineering of tyrosinase mutants to enhance substrate capabilities.",2022-09-16
118,Interface engineering breaks both stability and activity limits of RuO2 for sustainable water oxidation,"Designing catalytic materials with enhanced stability and activity is crucial for sustainable electrochemical energy technologies. RuO2 is the most active material for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrolysers aiming at producing ‘green’ hydrogen, however it encounters critical electrochemical oxidation and dissolution issues during reaction. It remains a grand challenge to achieve stable and active RuO2 electrocatalyst as the current strategies usually enhance one of the two properties at the expense of the other. Here, we report breaking the stability and activity limits of RuO2 in neutral and alkaline environments by constructing a RuO2/CoOx interface. We demonstrate that RuO2 can be greatly stabilized on the CoOx substrate to exceed the Pourbaix stability limit of bulk RuO2. This is realized by the preferential oxidation of CoOx during OER and the electron gain of RuO2 through the interface. Besides, a highly active Ru/Co dual-atom site can be generated around the RuO2/CoOx interface to synergistically adsorb the oxygen intermediates, leading to a favourable reaction path. The as-designed RuO2/CoOx catalyst provides an avenue to achieve stable and active materials for sustainable electrochemical energy technologies.","RuO2 encounters critical electrochemical dissolution issues during oxygen evolution reaction and it remains a grand challenge to achieve stable and active RuO2 electrocatalyst.

119,Clustering by measuring local direction centrality for data with heterogeneous density and weak connectivity,"Clustering is a powerful machine learning method for discovering similar patterns according to the proximity of elements in feature space. It is widely used in computer science, bioscience, geoscience, and economics. Although the state-of-the-art partition-based and connectivity-based clustering methods have been developed, weak connectivity and heterogeneous density in data impede their effectiveness. In this work, we propose a boundary-seeking Clustering algorithm using the local Direction Centrality (CDC). It adopts a density-independent metric based on the distribution of K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) to distinguish between internal and boundary points. The boundary points generate enclosed cages to bind the connections of internal points, thereby preventing cross-cluster connections and separating weakly-connected clusters. We demonstrate the validity of CDC by detecting complex structured clusters in challenging synthetic datasets, identifying cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data, recognizing speakers on voice corpuses, and testifying on various types of real-world benchmarks.",Clustering is a powerful machine learning method for discovering similar patterns according to the proximity of elements in feature space.

120,A multi-adenylate cyclase regulator at the flagellar tip controls African trypanosome transmission,"Signaling from ciliary microdomains controls developmental processes in metazoans. Trypanosome transmission requires development and migration in the tsetse vector alimentary tract. Flagellar cAMP signaling has been linked to parasite social motility (SoMo) in vitro, yet uncovering control of directed migration in fly organs is challenging. Here we show that the composition of an adenylate cyclase (AC) complex in the flagellar tip microdomain is essential for tsetse salivary gland (SG) colonization and SoMo. Cyclic AMP response protein 3 (CARP3) binds and regulates multiple AC isoforms. CARP3 tip localization depends on the cytoskeletal protein FLAM8. Re-localization of CARP3 away from the tip microdomain is sufficient to abolish SoMo and fly SG colonization. Since intrinsic development is normal in carp3 and flam8 knock-out parasites, AC complex-mediated tip signaling specifically controls parasite migration and thereby transmission. Participation of several developmentally regulated receptor-type AC isoforms may indicate the complexity of the in vivo signals perceived.","Trypanosomes can sense signal molecules and coordinate their movement in response to such signals, a phenomenon termed social motility (SoMo). Here, Bachmaier et al show that cyclic AMP response protein 3 (CARP3) localization to the flagellar tip and its interaction with a number of different adenylate cyclases is essential for migration to tsetse fly salivary glands and for SoMo, therewith linking SoMo and cAMP signaling to trypanosome transmission.",2022-09-16
121,Structures reveal a key mechanism of WAVE regulatory complex activation by Rac1 GTPase,"The Rho-family GTPase Rac1 activates the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) to drive Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization in many essential processes. Rac1 binds to WRC at two distinct sites—the A and D sites. Precisely how Rac1 binds and how the binding triggers WRC activation remain unknown. Here we report WRC structures by itself, and when bound to single or double Rac1 molecules, at ~3 Å resolutions by cryogenic-electron microscopy. The structures reveal that Rac1 binds to the two sites by distinct mechanisms, and binding to the A site, but not the D site, drives WRC activation. Activation involves a series of unique conformational changes leading to the release of sequestered WCA (WH2-central-acidic) polypeptide, which stimulates the Arp2/3 complex to polymerize actin. Together with biochemical and cellular analyses, the structures provide a novel mechanistic understanding of how the Rac1-WRC-Arp2/3-actin signaling axis is regulated in diverse biological processes and diseases.","Rho-family GTPase Rac1 activates the WAVE complex (WRC) to promote Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly in various processes.

122,Self-heating hotspots in superconducting nanowires cooled by phonon black-body radiation,"Controlling thermal transport is important for a range of devices and technologies, from phase change memories to next-generation electronics. This is especially true in nano-scale devices where thermal transport is altered by the influence of surfaces and changes in dimensionality. In superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, the thermal boundary conductance between the nanowire and the substrate it is fabricated on influences all of the performance metrics that make these detectors attractive for applications. This includes the maximum count rate, latency, jitter, and quantum efficiency. Despite its importance, the study of thermal boundary conductance in superconducting nanowire devices has not been done systematically, primarily due to the lack of a straightforward characterization method. Here, we show that simple electrical measurements can be used to estimate the thermal boundary conductance between nanowires and substrates and that these measurements agree with acoustic mismatch theory across a variety of substrates. Numerical simulations allow us to refine our understanding, however, open questions remain. This work should enable thermal engineering in superconducting nanowire electronics and cryogenic detectors for improved device performance.","Unlocking the ultimate potential of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors requires engineering their thermal properties.

123,Conserved features of TERT promoter duplications reveal an activation mechanism that mimics hotspot mutations in cancer,"Mutations in the TERT promoter represent the genetic underpinnings of tumor cell immortality. Beyond the two most common point mutations, which selectively recruit the ETS factor GABP to activate TERT, the significance of other variants is unknown. In seven cancer types, we identify duplications of wildtype sequence within the core promoter region of TERT that have strikingly similar features including an ETS motif, the duplication length and insertion site. The duplications recruit a GABP tetramer by virtue of the native ETS motif and its precisely spaced duplicated counterpart, activate the promoter and are clonal in a TERT expressing multifocal glioblastoma. We conclude that recurrent TERT promoter duplications are functionally and mechanistically equivalent to the hotspot mutations that confer tumor cell immortality. The shared mechanism of these divergent somatic genetic alterations suggests a strong selective pressure for recruitment of the GABP tetramer to activate TERT.","TERT promoter mutations are the most common noncoding alterations in cancers, although some remain to be characterised.

124,Serum neutralization activity declines but memory B cells persist after cure of chronic hepatitis C,"The increasing incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections underscores the need for an effective vaccine. Successful vaccines to other viruses generally depend on a long-lasting humoral response. However, data on the half-life of HCV-specific responses are lacking. Here we study archived sera and mononuclear cells that were prospectively collected up to 18 years after cure of chronic HCV infection to determine the role of HCV antigen in maintaining neutralizing antibody and B cell responses. We show that HCV-neutralizing activity decreases rapidly in potency and breadth after curative treatment. In contrast, HCV-specific memory B cells persist, and display a restored resting phenotype, normalized chemokine receptor expression and preserved ability to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells. The short half-life of HCV-neutralizing activity is consistent with a lack of long-lived plasma cells. The persistence of HCV-specific memory B cells and the reduced inflammation after cure provide an opportunity for vaccination to induce protective immunity against re-infection.","Long-term dynamics of the humoral response to HCV in cured individuals aren’t well understood.

125,A small molecule antagonist of SMN disrupts the interaction between SMN and RNAP II,"Survival of motor neuron (SMN) functions in diverse biological pathways via recognition of symmetric dimethylarginine (Rme2s) on proteins by its Tudor domain, and deficiency of SMN leads to spinal muscular atrophy. Here we report a potent and selective antagonist with a 4-iminopyridine scaffold targeting the Tudor domain of SMN. Our structural and mutagenesis studies indicate that both the aromatic ring and imino groups of compound 1 contribute to its selective binding to SMN. Various on-target engagement assays support that compound 1 specifically recognizes SMN in a cellular context and prevents the interaction of SMN with the R1810me2s of RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2A, resulting in transcription termination and R-loop accumulation mimicking SMN depletion. Thus, in addition to the antisense, RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, potent SMN antagonists could be used as an efficient tool to understand the biological functions of SMN.","The SMN protein recognizes symmetric dimethylarginine by its Tudor domain, and SMN deficiency leads to spinal muscular atrophy.

126,Water regulates the residence time of Benzamidine in Trypsin,"The process of ligand-protein unbinding is crucial in biophysics. Water is an essential part of any biological system and yet, many aspects of its role remain elusive. Here, we simulate with state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques the binding of Benzamidine to Trypsin which is a much studied and paradigmatic ligand-protein system. We use machine learning methods to determine efficient collective coordinates for the complex non-local network of water. These coordinates are used to perform On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling simulations, which we adapt to calculate also the ligand residence time. Our results, both static and dynamic, are in good agreement with experiments. We find that the presence of a water molecule located at the bottom of the binding pocket allows via a network of hydrogen bonds the ligand to be released into the solution. On a finer scale, even when unbinding is allowed, another water molecule further modulates the exit time.","Water is an essential part of any biological system, yet many aspects of its role remain elusive. Here the authors show, in a paradigmatic ligand-protein system, that water modulates the ligand residence time in a complex and non-local way, with possible implications in drug design.",2022-09-16
127,Tackling realistic Li+ flux for high-energy lithium metal batteries,"Electrolyte engineering advances Li metal batteries (LMBs) with high Coulombic efficiency (CE) by constructing LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, the low conductivity of LiF disturbs Li+ diffusion across SEI, thus inducing Li+ transfer-driven dendritic deposition. In this work, we establish a mechanistic model to decipher how the SEI affects Li plating in high-fluorine electrolytes. The presented theory depicts a linear correlation between the capacity loss and current density to identify the slope k (determined by Li+ mobility of SEI components) as an indicator for describing the homogeneity of Li+ flux across SEI, while the intercept dictates the maximum CE that electrolytes can achieve. This model inspires the design of an efficient electrolyte that generates dual-halide SEI to homogenize Li+ distribution and Li deposition. The model-driven protocol offers a promising energetic analysis to evaluate the compatibility of electrolytes to Li anode, thus guiding the design of promising electrolytes for LMBs.","The low conductivity of LiF disturbs Li+ diffusion across solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and induces Li+ transfer-driven dendritic growth. Herein, the authors establish a mechanistic model to decipher how the SEI affects realistic Li plating in high-fluorine electrolytes.",2022-09-16
128,Unleashing the potential of noncanonical amino acid biosynthesis to create cells with precision tyrosine sulfation,"Despite the great promise of genetic code expansion technology to modulate structures and functions of proteins, external addition of ncAAs is required in most cases and it often limits the utility of genetic code expansion technology, especially to noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) with poor membrane internalization. Here, we report the creation of autonomous cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, with the ability to biosynthesize and genetically encode sulfotyrosine (sTyr), an important protein post-translational modification with low membrane permeability. These engineered cells can produce site-specifically sulfated proteins at a higher yield than cells fed exogenously with the highest level of sTyr reported in the literature. We use these autonomous cells to prepare highly potent thrombin inhibitors with site-specific sulfation. By enhancing ncAA incorporation efficiency, this added ability of cells to biosynthesize ncAAs and genetically incorporate them into proteins greatly extends the utility of genetic code expansion methods.",Incorporation of noncanonical amino acids into proteins holds great promise for altering structure and function of these proteins. Here the authors generate metabolically modified prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that can biosynthesize sTyr and incorporate it into proteins in a site-specific manner.,2022-09-16
129,WRN promotes bone development and growth by unwinding SHOX-G-quadruplexes via its helicase activity in Werner Syndrome,"Werner Syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by premature aging due to mutations of the WRN gene. A classical sign in WS patients is short stature, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report that WRN is indispensable for chondrogenesis, which is the engine driving the elongation of bones and determines height. Zebrafish lacking wrn exhibit impairment of bone growth and have shorter body stature. We pinpoint the function of WRN to its helicase domain. We identify short-stature homeobox (SHOX) as a crucial and direct target of WRN and find that the WRN helicase core regulates the transcriptional expression of SHOX via unwinding G-quadruplexes. Consistent with this, shox−/− zebrafish exhibit impaired bone growth, while genetic overexpression of SHOX or shox expression rescues the bone developmental deficiency induced in WRN/wrn-null mutants both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, we have identified a previously unknown function of WRN in regulating bone development and growth through the transcriptional regulation of SHOX via the WRN helicase domain, thus illuminating a possible approach for new therapeutic strategies.","Short stature is a hallmark of Werner Syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms are not well studied. Here they report that WRN regulates bone development and growth by opening SHOX-G-quadruplexes via its helicase activity both in vitro and in vivo.",2022-09-16
130,Molecular architecture of the augmin complex,"Accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis depends on the correct assembly of the mitotic spindle, a bipolar structure composed mainly of microtubules. The augmin complex, or homologous to augmin subunits (HAUS) complex, is an eight-subunit protein complex required for building robust mitotic spindles in metazoa. Augmin increases microtubule density within the spindle by recruiting the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to pre-existing microtubules and nucleating branching microtubules. Here, we elucidate the molecular architecture of augmin by single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), computational methods, and crosslinking mass spectrometry (CLMS). Augmin’s highly flexible structure contains a V-shaped head and a filamentous tail, with the head existing in either extended or contracted conformational states. Our work highlights how cryo-EM, complemented by computational advances and CLMS, can elucidate the structure of a challenging protein complex and provides insights into the function of augmin in mediating microtubule branching nucleation.","The eight-subunit augmin complex is required to nucleate branching microtubules and create a robust mitotic spindle during cell division. Here, the authors use cryo-EM, crosslinking mass spectrometry, and computational tools to build a structural model of the human augmin complex.",2022-09-16
131,Multiple carbon cycle mechanisms associated with the glaciation of Marine Isotope Stage 4,"Here we use high-precision carbon isotope data (δ13C-CO2) to show atmospheric CO2 during Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS 4, ~70.5-59 ka) was controlled by a succession of millennial-scale processes. Enriched δ13C-CO2 during peak glaciation suggests increased ocean carbon storage. Variations in δ13C-CO2 in early MIS 4 suggest multiple processes were active during CO2 drawdown, potentially including decreased land carbon and decreased Southern Ocean air-sea gas exchange superposed on increased ocean carbon storage. CO2 remained low during MIS 4 while δ13C-CO2 fluctuations suggest changes in Southern Ocean and North Atlantic air-sea gas exchange. A 7 ppm increase in CO2 at the onset of Dansgaard-Oeschger event 19 (72.1 ka) and 27 ppm increase in CO2 during late MIS 4 (Heinrich Stadial 6, ~63.5-60 ka) involved additions of isotopically light carbon to the atmosphere. The terrestrial biosphere and Southern Ocean air-sea gas exchange are possible sources, with the latter event also involving decreased ocean carbon storage.","Summary for general audience: We used carbon stable isotope data from an Antarctic ice core to evaluate which mechanisms caused changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide 74-59 thousand years ago, including a ~40 ppm decrease at the beginning of the last ice age.",2022-09-16
132,Structural insights into the pSer/pThr dependent regulation of the SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase in insulin and CD28 signaling,"Serine/threonine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins is well known to modulate insulin signaling. However, the molecular details of this process have mostly been elusive. While exploring the role of phosphoserines, we have detected a direct link between Tyr-flanking Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites and regulation of specific phosphotyrosine phosphatases. Here we present a concise structural study on how the activity of SHP2 phosphatase is controlled by an asymmetric, dual phosphorylation of its substrates. The structure of SHP2 has been determined with three different substrate peptides, unveiling the versatile and highly dynamic nature of substrate recruitment. What is more, the relatively stable pre-catalytic state of SHP2 could potentially be useful for inhibitor design. Our findings not only show an unusual dependence of SHP2 catalytic activity on Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in IRS1 and CD28, but also suggest a negative regulatory mechanism that may also apply to other tyrosine kinase pathways as well.","SHP2 is an important human tyrosine phosphatase with key roles in cancer, immune responses and insulin signaling. Here, the authors explore its substrate recognition mechanism in molecular detail and uncover a complex regulatory mechanism for this enzyme that marks specific target sites for dephosphorylation.",2022-09-16
133,Efficient and accurate frailty model approach for genome-wide survival association analysis in large-scale biobanks,"With decades of electronic health records linked to genetic data, large biobanks provide unprecedented opportunities for systematically understanding the genetics of the natural history of complex diseases. Genome-wide survival association analysis can identify genetic variants associated with ages of onset, disease progression and lifespan. We propose an efficient and accurate frailty model approach for genome-wide survival association analysis of censored time-to-event (TTE) phenotypes by accounting for both population structure and relatedness. Our method utilizes state-of-the-art optimization strategies to reduce the computational cost. The saddlepoint approximation is used to allow for analysis of heavily censored phenotypes (>90%) and low frequency variants (down to minor allele count 20). We demonstrate the performance of our method through extensive simulation studies and analysis of five TTE phenotypes, including lifespan, with heavy censoring rates (90.9% to 99.8%) on ~400,000 UK Biobank participants with white British ancestry and ~180,000 individuals in FinnGen. We further analyzed 871 TTE phenotypes in the UK Biobank and presented the genome-wide scale phenome-wide association results with the PheWeb browser.","The proliferation of large biobanks necessitates statistical methods designed for genetic analysis on biobank data. Here, the authors have developed a frailty model-based method for GWAS analysis of time-to-event phenotypes in large biobanks that accounts for relatedness in samples and censoring of phenotypes.",2022-09-16
134,Record high Tc element superconductivity achieved in titanium,"It is challenging to search for high Tc superconductivity (SC) in transition metal elements wherein d electrons are usually not favored by conventional BCS theory. Here we report experimental discovery of surprising SC up to 310 GPa with Tc above 20 K in wide pressure range from 108 GPa to 240 GPa in titanium. The maximum Tconset above 26.2 K and zero resistance Tczero of 21 K are record high values hitherto achieved among element superconductors. The Hc2(0) is estimated to be ∼32 Tesla with coherence length 32 Å. The results show strong s-d transfer and d band dominance, indicating correlation driven contributions to high Tc SC in dense titanium. This finding is in sharp contrast to the theoretical predications based on pristine electron-phonon coupling scenario. The study opens a fresh promising avenue for rational design and discovery of high Tc superconductors among simple materials via pressure tuned unconventional mechanism.","Superconductivity at megabar pressures has recently attracted interest in the context of hydrides. Here, the authors demonstrate superconductivity up to 26 K at high pressure in elemental titanium, and further suggest that electron correlations contribute to the high Tc.",2022-09-15
135,Grain boundary structural transformation induced by co-segregation of aliovalent dopants,"Impurity doping is a conventional but one of the most effective ways to control the functional properties of materials. In insulating materials, the dopant solubility limit is considerably low in general, and the dopants often segregate to grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystals, which significantly alter their entire properties. However, detailed mechanisms on how dopant atoms form structures at GBs and change their properties remain a matter of conjecture. Here, we show GB structural transformation in α-Al2O3 induced by co-segregation of Ca and Si aliovalent dopants using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. To accommodate large-sized Ca ions at the GB core, the pristine GB atomic structure is transformed into a new GB structure with larger free volumes. Moreover, the Si and Ca dopants form a chemically ordered structure, and the charge compensation is achieved within the narrow GB core region rather than forming broader space charge layers. Our findings give an insight into GB engineering by utilizing aliovalent co-segregation.","The effect of aliovalent doping on grain boundary is not yet fully understood at the atomic level. Here, the authors report grain boundary structural transformation in α-Al2O3 is induced by co-segregation of multiple dopants using atomic-resolution electron microscopy and theoretical calculations.",2022-09-15
136,"Feedbacks between sea-floor spreading, trade winds and precipitation in the Southern Red Sea","Feedbacks between climatic and geological processes are highly controversial and testing them is a key challenge in Earth sciences. The Great Escarpment of the Arabian Red Sea margin has several features that make it a useful natural laboratory for studying the effect of surface processes on deep Earth. These include strong orographic rainfall, convex channel profiles versus concave swath profiles on the west side of the divide, morphological disequilibrium in fluvial channels, and systematic morphological changes from north to south that relate to depth changes of the central Red Sea. Here we show that these features are well interpreted with a cycle that initiated with the onset of spreading in the Red Sea and involves feedbacks between orographic precipitation, tectonic deformation, mid-ocean spreading and coastal magmatism. It appears that the feedback is enhanced by the moist easterly trade winds that initiated largely contemporaneously with sea floor spreading in the Red Sea.","Testing feedbacks between climatic and geological processes are challenging. Here, the authors show that geomorphological features of the southern Red Sea margin are best interpreted by a feedback cycle between orographic precipitation, mid-ocean spreading and coastal magmatism, and that the feedback is enhanced by the trade wind.",2022-09-15
137,Transcriptional profiling of matched patient biopsies clarifies molecular determinants of enzalutamide-induced lineage plasticity,"The androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitor enzalutamide (enza) is one of the principal treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Several emergent enza clinical resistance mechanisms have been described, including lineage plasticity in which the tumors manifest reduced dependency on the AR. To improve our understanding of enza resistance, herein we analyze the transcriptomes of matched biopsies from men with metastatic CRPC obtained prior to treatment and at progression (n = 21). RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrates that enza does not induce marked, sustained changes in the tumor transcriptome in most patients. However, three patients’ progression biopsies show evidence of lineage plasticity. The transcription factor E2F1 and pathways linked to tumor stemness are highly activated in baseline biopsies from patients whose tumors undergo lineage plasticity. We find a gene signature enriched in these baseline biopsies that is strongly associated with poor survival in independent patient cohorts and with risk of castration-induced lineage plasticity in patient-derived xenograft models, suggesting that tumors harboring this gene expression program may be at particular risk for resistance mediated by lineage plasticity and poor outcomes.","Lineage plasticity is increasingly recognized as an emergent resistance mechanism after treatment with androgen receptor signalling inhibitors. To understand determinants of resistance, the authors analyzed the transcriptomes of patient tumor biopsies before enzalutamide treatment and at progression and identified a gene expression program associated with lineage plasticity risk and poor outcomes.",2022-09-15
138,Humidity-sensitive chemoelectric flexible sensors based on metal-air redox reaction for health management,"Numerous studies have shown flexible electronics play important roles in health management. The way of power supply is always an essential factor of devices and self-powered ones are very attractive because of the fabrication easiness, usage comfort and aesthetics of the system. In this work, based on the metal-air redox reaction, which is usually used in designing metal-air batteries, we design a self-powered chemoelectric humidity sensor where a silk fibroin (SF) and LiBr gel matrix containing parallel aligned graphene oxide (GO) flakes serve as the electrolyte. The abundant hydrophilic groups in GO/SF and the hygroscopicity of LiBr lead to tight dependence of the output current on the humidity, enabling the sensor high sensitivity (0.09 μA/s/1%), fast response (1.05 s) and quick recovery (0.80 s). As proofs of concept, we design an all-in-one respiratory monitoring-diagnosing-treatment system and a non-contact human-machine interface, demonstrating the applications of the chemoelectric humidity sensor in health management.","Self-powered sensors are of interest in wearable technology and other applications. Here, the authors report on the creation of a metal-air redox reaction humidity sensor where the conductance and charge generated is influenced by the amount of absorbed water and demonstrate application in respiration monitoring.",2022-09-15
139,Role of chemisorbing species in growth at liquid metal-electrolyte interfaces revealed by in situ X-ray scattering,"Liquid-liquid interfaces offer intriguing possibilities for nanomaterials growth. Here, fundamental interface-related mechanisms that control the growth behavior in these systems are studied for Pb halide formation at the interface between NaX + PbX2 (X = F, Cl, Br) and liquid Hg electrodes using in situ X-ray scattering and complementary electrochemical and microscopy measurements. These studies reveal a decisive role of the halide species in nucleation and growth of these compounds. In Cl- and Br-containing solution, deposition starts by rapid formation of well-defined ultrathin (∼7 Å) precursor adlayers, which provide a structural template for the subsequent quasi-epitaxial growth of c-axis oriented Pb(OH)X bulk crystals. In contrast, growth in F-containing solution proceeds by slow formation of a more disordered deposit, resulting in random bulk crystal orientations on the Hg surface. These differences can be assigned to the interface chemistry, specifically halide chemisorption, which steers the formation of these highly textured deposits at the liquid-liquid interface.","Growth at liquid-liquid interfaces differ inherently from that on solids, making it attractive for nanomaterial formation. Here, the authors use X-ray scattering to derive a detailed microscopic picture of lead-halide growth on liquid mercury that reveals the key importance of anion adsorption.",2022-09-15
140,Phototunable chip-scale topological photonics: 160 Gbps waveguide and demultiplexer for THz 6G communication,"The revolutionary 5G cellular systems represent a breakthrough in the communication network design to provide a single platform for enabling enhanced broadband communications, virtual reality, autonomous driving, and the internet of everything. However, the ongoing massive deployment of 5G networks has unveiled inherent limitations that have stimulated the demand for innovative technologies with a vision toward 6G communications. Terahertz (0.1-10 THz) technology has been identified as a critical enabler for 6G communications with the prospect of massive capacity and connectivity. Nonetheless, existing terahertz on-chip communication devices suffer from crosstalk, scattering losses, limited data speed, and insufficient tunability. Here, we demonstrate a new class of phototunable, on-chip topological terahertz devices consisting of a broadband single-channel 160 Gbit/s communication link and a silicon Valley Photonic Crystal based demultiplexer. The optically controllable demultiplexing of two different carriers modulated signals without crosstalk is enabled by the topological protection and a critically coupled high-quality (Q) cavity. As a proof of concept, we demultiplexed high spectral efficiency 40 Gbit/s signals and demonstrated real-time streaming of uncompressed high-definition (HD) video (1.5 Gbit/s) using the topological photonic chip. Phototunable silicon topological photonics will augment complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) compatible terahertz technologies, vital for accelerating the development of futuristic 6G and 7G communication era driving the real-time terabits per second wireless connectivity for network sensing, holographic communication, and cognitive internet of everything.",6G communication requires high-speed and advanced functionalities on-chip.

141,A library of polytypic copper-based quaternary sulfide nanocrystals enables efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion,"Designing polytypic homojunction is an efficient way to regulate photogenerated electrons and holes, thereafter bringing desired physical and chemical properties and being attractive photocatalysts for solar-to-hydrogen conversion. However, the high-yield and controllable synthesis of well-defined polytypes especially for multinary chalcogenide - the fundamental factor favoring highly efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion - has yet to be achieved. Here, we report a general colloidal method to construct a library of polytypic copper-based quaternary sulfide nanocrystals, including Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2CdSnS4, Cu2CoSnS4, Cu2MnSnS4, Cu2FeSnS4, Cu3InSnS5 and Cu3GaSnS5, which can be synthesized by selective epitaxial growth of kesterite phase on wurtzite structure. Besides, this colloidal method allows the precise controlling of the homojunction number corresponding to the photocatalytic performance. The single-homojunction and double-homojunction polytypic Cu2ZnSnS4 nanocrystal photocatalysts show 2.8-fold and 3.9-fold improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates relative to the kesterite nanocrystals, respectively. This homojunction existed in the polytypic structure opens another way to engineer photocatalysts.","While polytypic semiconductors are promising for solar-to-fuel applications, preparing homojunction nanomaterials has proven challenging. Here, authors obtain a library of polytypic copper-based quaternary sulfide nanocrystals by selective epitaxial growth of kesterite phase on wurtzite structure.",2022-09-15
142,Subglacial precipitates record Antarctic ice sheet response to late Pleistocene millennial climate cycles,"Ice cores and offshore sedimentary records demonstrate enhanced ice loss along Antarctic coastal margins during millennial-scale warm intervals within the last glacial termination. However, the distal location and short temporal coverage of these records leads to uncertainty in both the spatial footprint of ice loss, and whether millennial-scale ice response occurs outside of glacial terminations. Here we present a >100kyr archive of periodic transitions in subglacial precipitate mineralogy that are synchronous with Late Pleistocene millennial-scale climate cycles. Geochemical and geochronologic data provide evidence for opal formation during cold periods via cryoconcentration of subglacial brine, and calcite formation during warm periods through the addition of subglacial meltwater originating from the ice sheet interior. These freeze-flush cycles represent cyclic changes in subglacial hydrologic-connectivity driven by ice sheet velocity fluctuations. Our findings imply that oscillating Southern Ocean temperatures drive a dynamic response in the Antarctic ice sheet on millennial timescales, regardless of the background climate state.","Piccione et al find evidence for Antarctic ice sheet instability driven by millennial cycles in Southern Ocean temperature, providing clues for the mechanisms that link climate change and rapid Antarctic ice loss events.",2022-09-15
143,Control of structure and spin texture in the van der Waals layered magnet CrSBr,"Controlling magnetism at nanometer length scales is essential for realizing high-performance spintronic, magneto-electric and topological devices and creating on-demand spin Hamiltonians probing fundamental concepts in physics. Van der Waals (vdW)-bonded layered magnets offer exceptional opportunities for such spin texture engineering. Here, we demonstrate nanoscale structural control in the layered magnet CrSBr with the potential to create spin patterns without the environmental sensitivity that has hindered such manipulations in other vdW magnets. We drive a local phase transformation using an electron beam that moves atoms and exchanges bond directions, effectively creating regions that have vertical vdW layers embedded within the initial horizontally vdW bonded exfoliated flakes. We calculate that the newly formed two-dimensional structure is ferromagnetically ordered in-plane with an energy gap in the visible spectrum, and weak antiferromagnetism between the planes, suggesting possibilities for creating spin textures and quantum magnetic phases.","Van der Waals magnetic materials are composed of atomically thin magnetically ordered layers stacked together. Here, aiming to control magnetism locally, Klein et al use an electron beam to create small regions where van der Waals layers are orientated perpendicular to the rest of the sample.",2022-09-15
144,The complement C3-complement factor D-C3a receptor signalling axis regulates cardiac remodelling in right ventricular failure,"Failure of the right ventricle plays a critical role in any type of heart failure. However, the mechanism remains unclear, and there is no specific therapy. Here, we show that the right ventricle predominantly expresses alternative complement pathway-related genes, including Cfd and C3aR1. Complement 3 (C3)-knockout attenuates right ventricular dysfunction and fibrosis in a mouse model of right ventricular failure. C3a is produced from C3 by the C3 convertase complex, which includes the essential component complement factor D (Cfd). Cfd-knockout mice also show attenuation of right ventricular failure. Moreover, the plasma concentration of CFD correlates with the severity of right ventricular failure in patients with chronic right ventricular failure. A C3a receptor (C3aR) antagonist dramatically improves right ventricular dysfunction in mice. In summary, we demonstrate the crucial role of the C3-Cfd-C3aR axis in right ventricular failure and highlight potential therapeutic targets for right ventricular failure.","Right ventricular (RV) failure is clinically crucial, but there is no specific therapy. Here, the authors show that the complement alternative pathway is activated in RV failure and that blockade of the pathway ameliorates RV failure in mice.",2022-09-15
145,Liver group 2 innate lymphoid cells regulate blood glucose levels through IL-13 signaling and suppression of gluconeogenesis,"The liver stores glycogen and releases glucose into the blood upon increased energy demand. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in adipose and pancreatic tissues are known for their involvement in glucose homeostasis, but the metabolic contribution of liver ILC2s has not been studied in detail. Here we show that liver ILC2s are directly involved in the regulation of blood glucose levels. Mechanistically, interleukin (IL)-33 treatment induces IL-13 production in liver ILC2s, while directly suppressing gluconeogenesis in a specific Hnf4a/G6pc-high primary hepatocyte cluster via Stat3. These hepatocytes significantly interact with liver ILC2s via IL-13/IL-13 receptor signaling. The results of transcriptional complex analysis and GATA3-ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and scRNA-seq trajectory analyses establish a positive regulatory role for the transcription factor GATA3 in IL-13 production by liver ILC2s, while AP-1 family members are shown to suppress IL-13 release. Thus, we identify a regulatory role and molecular mechanism by which liver ILC2s contribute to glucose homeostasis.","Besides hepatocytes, resident immune cells of the liver are also contributing to the body’s energy homeostasis. Here authors show that group 2 innate lymphoid cells interact with a specific set of hepatocytes in suppressing gluconeogenesis and regulate blood glucose levels via Interleukin-13 signalling.",2022-09-15
146,Spontaneous spin-valley polarization in NbSe2 at a van der Waals interface,"A proximity effect at a van der Waals (vdW) interface enables creation of an emergent quantum electronic ground state. Here we demonstrate that an originally superconducting two-dimensional (2D) NbSe2 forms a ferromagnetic ground state with spontaneous spin polarization at a vdW interface with a 2D ferromagnet V5Se8. We investigated the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of the NbSe2/V5Se8 magnetic vdW heterostructures, and found that the sign of the AHE was reversed as the number of the V5Se8 layer was thinned down to the monolayer limit. Interestingly, the AHE signal of those samples was enhanced with the in-plane magnetic fields, suggesting an additional contribution to the AHE signal other than magnetization. This unusual behavior is well reproduced by band structure calculations, where the emergence of the Berry curvature along the spin-degenerate nodal lines in 2D NbSe2 by the in-plane magnetization plays a key role, unveiling a unique interplay between magnetism and Zeeman-type spin-orbit interaction in a non-centrosymmetric 2D quantum material.","Van der Waals heterostructures made of 2D materials offer a rich platform for the study of novel proximity effects. Here, by means of Hall effect measurements, the authors show a proximity-induced ferromagnetic/ferrovalley ground state with spontaneous spin-valley polarization in a V5Se8/NbSe2 heterostructure.",2022-09-15
147,Unveiling Weyl-related optical responses in semiconducting tellurium by mid-infrared circular photogalvanic effect,"Elemental tellurium, conventionally recognized as a narrow bandgap semiconductor, has recently aroused research interests for exploiting Weyl physics. Chirality is a unique feature of Weyl cones and can support helicity-dependent photocurrent generation, known as circular photogalvanic effect. Here, we report circular photogalvanic effect with opposite signs at two different mid-infrared wavelengths which provides evidence of Weyl-related optical responses. These two different wavelengths correspond to two critical transitions relating to the bands of different Weyl cones and the sign of circular photogalvanic effect is determined by the chirality selection rules within certain Weyl cone and between two different Weyl cones. Further experimental evidences confirm the observed response is an intrinsic second-order process. With flexibly tunable bandgap and Fermi level, tellurium is established as an ideal semiconducting material to manipulate and explore chirality-related Weyl physics in both conduction and valence bands. These results are also directly applicable to helicity-sensitive optoelectronics devices.","Materials with Weyl cones and band gaps coexisting are desired due to their combination of Weyl cones and the tunable and controllable nature of semiconductor. Here, the authors find Weyl-related band structures and semiconducting gap of tellurium.",2022-09-15
148,In situ X-ray and acoustic observations of deep seismic faulting upon phase transitions in olivine,"The activity of deep-focus earthquakes, which increases with depth from ~400 km to a peak at ~600 km, is enigmatic, because conventional brittle failure is unlikely to occur at elevated pressures. It becomes increasingly clear that pressure-induced phase transitions of olivine are responsible for the occurrence of the earthquakes, based on deformation experiments under pressure. However, many such experiments were made using analogue materials and those on mantle olivine are required to verify the hypotheses developed by these studies. Here we report the results of deformation experiments on (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 olivine at 11−17 GPa and 860−1350 K, equivalent to the conditions of the slabs subducted into the mantle transition zone. We find that throughgoing faulting occurs only at very limited temperatures of 1100−1160 K, accompanied by intense acoustic emissions at the onset of rupture. Fault sliding aided by shear heating occurs along a weak layer, which is formed via linking-up of lenticular packets filled with nanocrystalline olivine and wadsleyite. Our study suggests that transformational faulting occurs on the isothermal surface of the metastable olivine wedge in slabs, leading to deep-focus earthquakes in limited regions and depth range.","This paper shows that formation of thin weak layers filled with nanocrystalline olivine/wadsleyite, upon the pressure-induced phase transition of olivine, is the major cause of deep-focus earthquakes on the metastable olivine wedge in deep slabs.",2022-09-15
149,AC amplification gain in organic electrochemical transistors for impedance-based single cell sensors,"Research on electrolyte-gated and organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) architectures is motivated by the prospect of a highly biocompatible interface capable of amplifying bioelectronic signals at the site of detection. Despite many demonstrations in these directions, a quantitative model for OECTs as impedance biosensors is still lacking. We overcome this issue by introducing a model experiment where we simulate the detection of a single cell by the impedance sensing of a dielectric microparticle. The highly reproducible experiment allows us to study the impact of transistor geometry and operation conditions on device sensitivity. With the data we rationalize a mathematical model that provides clear guidelines for the optimization of OECTs as single cell sensors, and we verify the quantitative predictions in an in-vitro experiment. In the optimized geometry, the OECT-based impedance sensor allows to record single cell adhesion and detachment transients, showing a maximum gain of 20.2±0.9 dB with respect to a single electrode-based impedance sensor.",The authors develop a quantitative description of alternating current amplification gain in organic electrochemical transistors. The findings are applied to achieve detection of single glioblastoma cell adhesion with 20 dB gain compared to microelectrodes.,2022-09-15
150,Sirtuin 6 inhibition protects against glucocorticoid-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by regulating IGF/PI3K/AKT signaling,"Chronic activation of stress hormones such as glucocorticoids leads to skeletal muscle wasting in mammals. However, the molecular events that mediate glucocorticoid-induced muscle wasting are not well understood. Here, we show that SIRT6, a chromatin-associated deacetylase indirectly regulates glucocorticoid-induced muscle wasting by modulating IGF/PI3K/AKT signaling. Our results show that SIRT6 levels are increased during glucocorticoid-induced reduction of myotube size and during skeletal muscle atrophy in mice. Notably, overexpression of SIRT6 spontaneously decreases the size of primary myotubes in a cell-autonomous manner. On the other hand, SIRT6 depletion increases the diameter of myotubes and protects them against glucocorticoid-induced reduction in myotube size, which is associated with enhanced protein synthesis and repression of atrogenes. In line with this, we find that muscle-specific SIRT6 deficient mice are resistant to glucocorticoid-induced muscle wasting. Mechanistically, we find that SIRT6 deficiency hyperactivates IGF/PI3K/AKT signaling through c-Jun transcription factor-mediated increase in IGF2 expression. The increased activation, in turn, leads to nuclear exclusion and transcriptional repression of the FoxO transcription factor, a key activator of muscle atrophy. Further, we find that pharmacological inhibition of SIRT6 protects against glucocorticoid-induced muscle wasting in mice by regulating IGF/PI3K/AKT signaling implicating the role of SIRT6 in glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy.","Chronic stress induces skeletal muscle atrophy via upregulation of glucocorticoid levels. Here, the authors show that SIRT6 transcriptionally regulates glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy by modulating IGF/PI3K/AKT signalling.",2022-09-15
151,Pangenomic analysis of Chinese gastric cancer,"Pangenomic study might improve the completeness of human reference genome (GRCh38) and promote precision medicine. Here, we use an automated pipeline of human pangenomic analysis to build gastric cancer pan-genome for 185 paired deep sequencing data (370 samples), and characterize the gene presence-absence variations (PAVs) at whole genome level. Genes ACOT1, GSTM1, SIGLEC14 and UGT2B17 are identified as highly absent genes in gastric cancer population. A set of genes from unaligned sequences with GRCh38 are predicted. We successfully locate one of predicted genes GC0643 on chromosome 9q34.2. Overexpression of GC0643 significantly inhibits cell growth, cell migration and invasion, cell cycle progression, and induces cell apoptosis in cancer cells. The tumor suppressor functions can be reversed by shGC0643 knockdown. The GC0643 is approved by NCBI database (GenBank: MW194843.1). Collectively, the robust pan-genome strategy provides a deeper understanding of the gene PAVs in the human cancer genome.","Human pan-genomics are increasing our knowledge of genomic diversity and genetic factors in disease. Here, the authors built a gastric cancer pan-genome that included the sequences of Chinese Han patients, and predicted putative and previously unaligned genes associated with gastric cancer.",2022-09-15
152,Murine fetal bone marrow does not support functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells until birth,"While adult bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and their extrinsic regulation is well studied, little is known about the composition, function, and extrinsic regulation of the first HSPCs to enter the BM during development. Here, we functionally interrogate murine BM HSPCs from E15.5 through P0. Our work reveals that fetal BM HSPCs are present by E15.5, but distinct from the HSPC pool seen in fetal liver, both phenotypically and functionally, until near birth. We also generate a transcriptional atlas of perinatal BM HSPCs and the BM niche in mice across ontogeny, revealing that fetal BM lacks HSPCs with robust intrinsic stem cell programs, as well as niche cells supportive of HSPCs. In contrast, stem cell programs are preserved in neonatal BM HSPCs, which reside in a niche expressing HSC supportive factors distinct from those seen in adults. Collectively, our results provide important insights into the factors shaping hematopoiesis during this understudied window of hematopoietic development.","Relatively little is known about the first hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to arrive in the fetal bone marrow. Here they characterize the frequency, function, and molecular identity of fetal BM HSPCs and their bone marrow niche, and show that most BM HSPCs have little hematopoietic function until birth.",2022-09-15
153,Cryptococcal Hsf3 controls intramitochondrial ROS homeostasis by regulating the respiratory process,"Mitochondrial quality control prevents accumulation of intramitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (mtROS), thereby protecting cells against DNA damage, genome instability, and programmed cell death. However, underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood, particularly in fungal species. Here, we show that Cryptococcus neoformans heat shock factor 3 (CnHsf3) exhibits an atypical function in regulating mtROS independent of the unfolded protein response. CnHsf3 acts in nuclei and mitochondria, and nuclear- and mitochondrial-targeting signals are required for its organelle-specific functions. It represses the expression of genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle while promoting expression of genes involved in electron transfer chain. In addition, CnHsf3 responds to multiple intramitochondrial stresses; this response is mediated by oxidation of the cysteine residue on its DNA binding domain, which enhances DNA binding. Our results reveal a function of HSF proteins in regulating mtROS homeostasis that is independent of the unfolded protein response.","Mitochondrial quality control prevents accumulation of intramitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), thus protecting cells against DNA damage. Here, Gao et al. show that an atypical heat shock factor responds to intramitochondrial stresses and regulates mtROS homeostasis in the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans.",2022-09-15
154,Enabling scalable optical computing in synthetic frequency dimension using integrated cavity acousto-optics,"Optical computing with integrated photonics brings a pivotal paradigm shift to data-intensive computing technologies. However, the scaling of on-chip photonic architectures using spatially distributed schemes faces the challenge imposed by the fundamental limit of integration density. Synthetic dimensions of light offer the opportunity to extend the length of operand vectors within a single photonic component. Here, we show that large-scale, complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications on synthetic frequency lattices can be performed using an ultra-efficient, silicon-based nanophotonic cavity acousto-optic modulator. By harnessing the resonantly enhanced strong electro-optomechanical coupling, we achieve, in a single such modulator, the full-range phase-coherent frequency conversions across the entire synthetic lattice, which constitute a fully connected linear computing layer. Our demonstrations open up the route toward the experimental realizations of frequency-domain integrated optical computing systems simultaneously featuring very large-scale data processing and small device footprints.",Synthetic frequency dimension from light modulation enables scalable optical computing. The authors show an efficient silicon-based acousto-optic modulator that generates large synthetic frequency lattices and performs matrix-vector multiplications.,2022-09-15
155,Reconstitution of microtubule into GTP-responsive nanocapsules,"Nanocapsules that collapse in response to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) have the potential as drug carriers for efficiently curing diseases caused by cancer and RNA viruses because GTP is present at high levels in such diseased cells and tissues. However, known GTP-responsive carriers also respond to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is abundant in normal cells as well. Here, we report the elaborate reconstitution of microtubule into a nanocapsule that selectively responds to GTP. When the tubulin monomer from microtubule is incubated at 37 °C with a mixture of GTP (17 mol%) and nonhydrolysable GTP* (83 mol%), a tubulin nanosheet forms. Upon addition of photoreactive molecular glue to the resulting dispersion, the nanosheet is transformed into a nanocapsule. Cell death results when a doxorubicin-containing nanocapsule, after photochemically crosslinked for properly stabilizing its shell, is taken up into cancer cells that overexpress GTP.","GTP-triggered release from drug carriers has huge potential in cancer therapy but current carriers suffers from off target release due to ATP also acting as a trigger. Here, the authors report on the development of a microtubule capsule which is engineered to be responsive to only GTP not ATP and demonstrate targeted drug delivery.",2022-09-15
156,Inhibition of UBA6 by inosine augments tumour immunogenicity and responses,"Anti-cancer immunity and response to immune therapy is influenced by the metabolic states of the tumours. Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) is known to involve metabolic adaptation, however, the mechanism is not fully known. Here we show, by metabolic profiling of plasma samples from melanoma-bearing mice undergoing anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 combination therapy, that higher levels of purine metabolites, including inosine, mark ICB sensitivity. Metabolic profiles of ICB-treated human cancers confirm the association between inosine levels and ICB sensitivity. In mouse models, inosine supplementation sensitizes tumours to ICB, even if they are intrinsically ICB resistant, by enhancing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and hence generating an immunologically hotter microenvironment. We find that inosine directly inhibits UBA6 in tumour cells, and lower level of UBA6 makes the tumour more immunogenic and this is reflected in favourable outcome following ICB therapy in human melanomas. Transplanted mouse melanoma and breast cancer cells with genetic ablation of Uba6 show higher sensitivity to ICB than wild type tumours. Thus, we provide evidence of an inosine-regulated UBA6-dependent pathway governing tumour-intrinsic immunogenicity and hence sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibition, which might provide targets to overcome ICB resistance.",The metabolic environment of tumours has wide-ranging effects on the anti-tumour immune response and the outcome of immune therapy. Authors show here that the purine metabolite inosine enhances tumour immunogenicity and thus immune checkpoint blockade therapy response by inhibiting the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA6 in tumour cells.,2022-09-15
157,Integrated wafer-scale ultra-flat graphene by gradient surface energy modulation,"The integration of large-scale two-dimensional (2D) materials onto semiconductor wafers is highly desirable for advanced electronic devices, but challenges such as transfer-related crack, contamination, wrinkle and doping remain. Here, we developed a generic method by gradient surface energy modulation, leading to a reliable adhesion and release of graphene onto target wafers. The as-obtained wafer-scale graphene exhibited a damage-free, clean, and ultra-flat surface with negligible doping, resulting in uniform sheet resistance with only ~6% deviation. The as-transferred graphene on SiO2/Si exhibited high carrier mobility reaching up ~10,000 cm2 V−1 s−1, with quantum Hall effect (QHE) observed at room temperature. Fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) appeared at 1.7 K after encapsulation by h-BN, yielding ultra-high mobility of ~280,000 cm2 V−1 s−1. Integrated wafer-scale graphene thermal emitters exhibited significant broadband emission in near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. Overall, the proposed methodology is promising for future integration of wafer-scale 2D materials in advanced electronics and optoelectronics.","Defect-free integration of 2D materials onto semiconductor wafers is desired to implement heterogeneous electronic devices.

158,Batch effects removal for microbiome data via conditional quantile regression,"Batch effects in microbiome data arise from differential processing of specimens and can lead to spurious findings and obscure true signals. Strategies designed for genomic data to mitigate batch effects usually fail to address the zero-inflated and over-dispersed microbiome data. Most strategies tailored for microbiome data are restricted to association testing or specialized study designs, failing to allow other analytic goals or general designs. Here, we develop the Conditional Quantile Regression (ConQuR) approach to remove microbiome batch effects using a two-part quantile regression model. ConQuR is a comprehensive method that accommodates the complex distributions of microbial read counts by non-parametric modeling, and it generates batch-removed zero-inflated read counts that can be used in and benefit usual subsequent analyses. We apply ConQuR to simulated and real microbiome datasets and demonstrate its advantages in removing batch effects while preserving the signals of interest.","Here, the authors present ConQuR, a conditional quantile regression method that removes microbiome batch effects through non-parametric modeling of complex microbial read counts, while preserving the signals of interest.",2022-09-15
159,Exceptional water production yield enabled by batch-processed portable water harvester in semi-arid climate,"Sorption-based atmospheric water harvesting has the potential to realize water production anytime, anywhere, but reaching a hundred-gram high water yield in semi-arid climates is still challenging, although state-of-the-art sorbents have been used. Here, we report a portable and modularized water harvester with scalable, low-cost, and lightweight LiCl-based hygroscopic composite (Li-SHC) sorbents. Li-SHC achieves water uptake capacity of 1.18, 1.79, and 2.93 g g−1 at 15%, 30%, and 60% RH, respectively. Importantly, considering the large mismatch between water capture and release rates, a rationally designed batch processing mode is proposed to pursue maximum water yield in a single diurnal cycle. Together with the advanced thermal design, the water harvester shows an exceptional water yield of 311.69 g day−1 and 1.09 g gsorbent−1 day−1 in the semi-arid climate with the extremely low RH of ~15%, demonstrating the adaptability and possibility of achieving large-scale and reliable water production in real scenarios.","Sorption-based atmospheric water harvesting has the potential to realize flexible water production but reaching high water yield in semi-arid climate is still challenging.

160,Structure of the active Gi-coupled human lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 complexed with a potent agonist,"Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA1) is one of the six G protein-coupled receptors activated by the bioactive lipid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA1 is a drug target for various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and neuropathic pain. Notably, LPA1 agonists have potential therapeutic value for obesity and urinary incontinence. Here, we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the active human LPA1-Gi complex bound to ONO-0740556, an LPA analog with more potent activity against LPA1. Our structure elucidated the details of the agonist binding mode and receptor activation mechanism mediated by rearrangements of transmembrane segment 7 and the central hydrophobic core. A structural comparison of LPA1 and other phylogenetically-related lipid-sensing GPCRs identified the structural determinants for lipid preference of LPA1. Moreover, we characterized the structural polymorphisms at the receptor-G-protein interface, which potentially reflect the G-protein dissociation process. Our study provides insights into the detailed mechanism of LPA1 binding to agonists and paves the way toward the design of drug-like agonists targeting LPA1.",LPA1 is one of the GPCRs that are drug targets for various diseases.

161,Transcriptional dynamics of murine motor neuron maturation in vivo and in vitro,"Neurons born in the embryo can undergo a protracted period of maturation lasting well into postnatal life. How gene expression changes are regulated during maturation and whether they can be recapitulated in cultured neurons remains poorly understood. Here, we show that mouse motor neurons exhibit pervasive changes in gene expression and accessibility of associated regulatory regions from embryonic till juvenile age. While motifs of selector transcription factors, ISL1 and LHX3, are enriched in nascent regulatory regions, motifs of NFI factors, activity-dependent factors, and hormone receptors become more prominent in maturation-dependent enhancers. Notably, stem cell-derived motor neurons recapitulate ~40% of the maturation expression program in vitro, with neural activity playing only a modest role as a late-stage modulator. Thus, the genetic maturation program consists of a core hardwired subprogram that is correctly executed in vitro and an extrinsically-controlled subprogram that is dependent on the in vivo context of the maturing organism.","Patel et al. show that gene expression and regulation in motor neurons is dynamic until juvenile age. A core subprogram (~40% of genes) is faithfully recapitulated in cultured motor neurons, with neuronal activity playing only a modulatory role.",2022-09-15
162,Decoupled Asian monsoon intensity and precipitation during glacial-interglacial transitions on the Chinese Loess Plateau,"The discrepancies among the variations in global ice volume, cave stalagmite δ18O and rainfall reconstructed by cosmogenic 10Be tremendously restrain our understanding of the evolution of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Here, we present a 430-ka EASM mean annual precipitation record on the Chinese Loess Plateau obtained using branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers based on a deep learning neural network; this rainfall record corresponds well with cave-derived δ18O data from southern China but differs from precipitation reconstructed by 10Be. Both branched tetraether membrane lipids and cave δ18O may be affected by soil moisture and atmospheric temperature when glacial and interglacial conditions alternated and were thus decoupled from atmospheric precipitation; instead, they represent variations in the intensity of the EASM. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the brGDGT-DLNN method can significantly extend the temporal scale record of the EASM and is not restricted by geographic location compared with stalagmite records.","In considering Asian monsoon intensity and precipitation during glacial-interglacial transitions in Chinese Loess Plateau, a new study finds that brGDGT-DLNN method can significantly extend the temporal scale record of the EASM and is not restricted by geographic location compared with stalagmite records.",2022-09-14
163,Layered feedback control overcomes performance trade-off in synthetic biomolecular networks,"Layered feedback is an optimization strategy in feedback control designs widely used in engineering. Control theory suggests that layering multiple feedbacks could overcome the robustness-speed performance trade-off limit. In natural biological networks, genes are often regulated in layers to adapt to environmental perturbations. It is hypothesized layering architecture could also overcome the robustness-speed performance trade-off in genetic networks. In this work, we validate this hypothesis with a synthetic biomolecular network in living E. coli cells. We start with system dynamics analysis using models of various complexities to guide the design of a layered control architecture in living cells. Experimentally, we interrogate system dynamics under three groups of perturbations. We consistently observe that the layered control improves system performance in the robustness-speed domain. This work confirms that layered control could be adopted in synthetic biomolecular networks for performance optimization. It also provides insights into understanding genetic feedback control architectures in nature.","Layered feedback is an optimization strategy in feedback control designs widely used in engineering. Here, combining simulation and experimentation, the authors apply layered control - a powerful optimization strategy in engineering - to synthetic biomolecular networks in living bacteria to show layered control overcomes performance trade-offs in biology.",2022-09-14
164,Biochemical and structural insights of multifunctional flavin-dependent monooxygenase FlsO1-catalyzed unexpected xanthone formation,"Xanthone-containing natural products display diverse pharmacological properties. The biosynthetic mechanisms of the xanthone formation have not been well documented. Here we show that the flavoprotein monooxygenase FlsO1 in the biosynthesis of fluostatins not only functionally compensates for the monooxygenase FlsO2 in converting prejadomycin to dehydrorabelomycin, but also unexpectedly converts prejadomycin to xanthone-containing products by catalyzing three successive oxidations including hydroxylation, epoxidation and Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. We also provide biochemical evidence to support the physiological role of FlsO1 as the benzo[b]-fluorene C5-hydrolase by using nenestatin C as a substrate mimic. Finally, we resolve the crystal structure of FlsO1 in complex with the cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide close to the “in” conformation to enable the construction of reactive substrate-docking models to understand the basis of a single enzyme-catalyzed multiple oxidations. This study highlights a mechanistic perspective for the enzymatic xanthone formation in actinomycetes and sets an example for the versatile functions of flavoproteins.","The biosynthesis of xanthones has not been well documented. Here, the authors report that monooxygenase FlsO1 catalyzes three successive oxidations – hydroxylation, epoxidation and Baeyer–Villiger oxidation—to form the xanthone scaffold in actinomycetes.",2022-09-14
165,Energy comparison of sequential and integrated CO2 capture and electrochemical conversion,"Integrating carbon dioxide (CO2) electrolysis with CO2 capture provides exciting new opportunities for energy reductions by simultaneously removing the energy-demanding regeneration step in CO2 capture and avoiding critical issues faced by CO2 gas-fed electrolysers. However, understanding the potential energy advantages of an integrated process is not straightforward due to the interconnected processes which require knowledge of both capture and electrochemical conversion processes. Here, we identify the upper limits of the integrated process from an energy perspective by comparing the working principles and performance of integrated and sequential approaches. Our high-level energy analyses unveil that an integrated electrolyser must show similar performance to the gas-fed electrolyser to ensure an energy benefit of up to 44% versus the sequential route. However, such energy benefits diminish if future gas-fed electrolysers resolve the CO2 utilisation issue and if an integrated electrolyser shows lower conversion efficiencies than the gas-fed system.","Coupling CO2 capture and electrolysis offers new opportunities to reduce energy cost. Here, the authors identify that the integrated electrolyser must show similar performance to the gas-fed electrolyser to ensure an energy benefit of up to 44% versus sequential capture and conversion processes.",2022-09-14
166,Cancer co-opts differentiation of B-cell precursors into macrophage-like cells,"We have recently reported that some cancers induce accumulation of bone marrow (BM) B-cell precursors in the spleen to convert them into metastasis-promoting, immunosuppressive B cells. Here, using various murine tumor models and samples from humans with breast and ovarian cancers, we provide evidence that cancers also co-opt differentiation of these B-cell precursors to generate macrophage-like cells (termed B-MF). We link the transdifferentiation to a small subset of CSF1R+ Pax5Low cells within BM pre-B and immature B cells responding to cancer-secreted M-CSF with downregulation of the transcription factor Pax5 via CSF1R signaling. Although the primary source of tumor-associated macrophages is monocytes, B-MFs are phenotypically and functionally distinguishable. Compared to monocyte-derived macrophages, B-MFs more efficiently phagocytize apoptotic cells, suppress proliferation of T cells and induce FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. In mouse tumor models, B-MFs promote shrinkage of the tumor-infiltrating IFNγ+ CD4 T cell pool and increase cancer progression and metastasis, suggesting that this cancer-induced transdifferentiation pathway is functionally relevant and hence could serve as an immunotherapeutic target.","The tumour microenvironment has been shown to change the phenotypes and functionality of immune cells to enable tumour propagation. Here authors show that cancers can derail B cell development to give rise to macrophage-like cells, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis via disabling local T cell response.",2022-09-14
167,Streptococcus agalactiae cadD alleviates metal stress and promotes intracellular survival in macrophages and ascending infection during pregnancy,"Perinatal infection with Streptococcus agalactiae, or Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is associated with preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, and stillbirth. Here, we study the interactions of GBS with macrophages, essential sentinel immune cells that defend the gravid reproductive tract. Transcriptional analyses of GBS-macrophage co-cultures reveal enhanced expression of a gene encoding a putative metal resistance determinant, cadD. Deletion of cadD reduces GBS survival in macrophages, metal efflux, and resistance to metal toxicity. In a mouse model of ascending infection during pregnancy, the ΔcadD strain displays attenuated bacterial burden, inflammation, and cytokine production in gestational tissues. Furthermore, depletion of host macrophages alters cytokine expression and decreases GBS invasion in a cadD-dependent fashion. Our results indicate that GBS cadD plays an important role in metal detoxification, which promotes immune evasion and bacterial proliferation in the pregnant host.","Perinatal infection with Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is associated with preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, and stillbirth. Here, Korir et al. show that gene cadD, encoding a putative metal efflux transporter, is important for metal detoxification, immune evasion and bacterial proliferation in the pregnant host.",2022-09-14
168,Structure of the membrane-bound formate hydrogenlyase complex from Escherichia coli,"The prototypical hydrogen-producing enzyme, the membrane-bound formate hydrogenlyase (FHL) complex from Escherichia coli, links formate oxidation at a molybdopterin-containing formate dehydrogenase to proton reduction at a [NiFe] hydrogenase. It is of intense interest due to its ability to efficiently produce H2 during fermentation, its reversibility, allowing H2-dependent CO2 reduction, and its evolutionary link to respiratory complex I. FHL has been studied for over a century, but its atomic structure remains unknown. Here we report cryo-EM structures of FHL in its aerobically and anaerobically isolated forms at resolutions reaching 2.6 Å. This includes well-resolved density for conserved loops linking the soluble and membrane arms believed to be essential in coupling enzymatic turnover to ion translocation across the membrane in the complex I superfamily. We evaluate possible structural determinants of the bias toward hydrogen production over its oxidation and describe an unpredicted metal-binding site near the interface of FdhF and HycF subunits that may play a role in redox-dependent regulation of FdhF interaction with the complex.",New cryo-EM structures of the formate hydrogenlyase complex from the model bacterium E. coli clarify how electrons and protons move through the complex and are combined to make H2 gas.

169,Optogenetic control of apical constriction induces synthetic morphogenesis in mammalian tissues,"The emerging field of synthetic developmental biology proposes bottom-up approaches to examine the contribution of each cellular process to complex morphogenesis. However, the shortage of tools to manipulate three-dimensional (3D) shapes of mammalian tissues hinders the progress of the field. Here we report the development of OptoShroom3, an optogenetic tool that achieves fast spatiotemporal control of apical constriction in mammalian epithelia. Activation of OptoShroom3 through illumination in an epithelial Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell sheet reduces the apical surface of the stimulated cells and causes displacements in the adjacent regions. Light-induced apical constriction provokes the folding of epithelial cell colonies on soft gels. Its application to murine and human neural organoids leads to thickening of neuroepithelia, apical lumen reduction in optic vesicles, and flattening in neuroectodermal tissues. These results show that spatiotemporal control of apical constriction can trigger several types of 3D deformation depending on the initial tissue context.","Apical constriction is a force-generating process required during embryonic development; there is a lack of tools to manipulate 3D shapes of mammalian tissues. Here the authors report the optogenetic method, OptoShroom3, to achieve fast spatiotemporal control of apical constriction in mammalian epithelia.",2022-09-14
170,Epigenetic activation of the FLT3 gene by ZNF384 fusion confers a therapeutic susceptibility in acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"FLT3 is an attractive therapeutic target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but the mechanism for its activation in this cancer is incompletely understood. Profiling global gene expression in large ALL cohorts, we identify over-expression of FLT3 in ZNF384-rearranged ALL, consistently across cases harboring different fusion partners with ZNF384. Mechanistically, we discover an intergenic enhancer element at the FLT3 locus that is exclusively activated in ZNF384-rearranged ALL, with the enhancer-promoter looping directly mediated by the fusion protein. There is also a global enrichment of active enhancers within ZNF384 binding sites across the genome in ZNF384-rearranged ALL cells. Downregulation of ZNF384 blunts FLT3 activation and decreases ALL cell sensitivity to FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib in vitro. In patient-derived xenograft models of ZNF384-rearranged ALL, gilteritinib exhibits significant anti-leukemia efficacy as a monotherapy in vivo. Collectively, our results provide insights into FLT3 regulation in ALL and point to potential genomics-guided targeted therapy for this patient population.","Different molecular subtypes defined by specific gene rearrangements have been described for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).

We herein develop an in situ Fishing method that can monitor the dynamic formation of protein corona on ultra-small chiral Cu2S nanoparticles (NPs) allowing us to directly separate and identify the corona protein composition. Our method detects spatiotemporal processes in the evolution of hard and soft coronas on chiral NPs, revealing subtle differences in NP − protein interactions even within several minutes. This study highlights the importance of in situ and dynamic analysis of soft/hard corona, provides insights into the role of soft corona in mediating biological responses of NPs, and offers a universal strategy to characterize soft corona to guide the rational design of biomedical nanomaterials.","Characterizing the soft protein corona on nanoparticles i.e. the outer layer of the corona, remains a longstanding challenge.

172,Observation of Bose-Einstein condensates of excitons in a bulk semiconductor,"An unambiguous observation of the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons in a photoexcited bulk semiconductor and elucidation of its inherent nature have been longstanding problems in condensed matter physics. Here, we observe the quantum phase transition and a Bose-Einstein condensate appearing in a trapped gas of 1s paraexcitons in bulk Cu2O below 400 mK, by directly visualizing the exciton cloud in real space using mid-infrared induced absorption imaging that we realized in a dilution refrigerator. Our study shows that the paraexciton condensate is undetectable by conventional luminescence spectroscopy. We find an unconventionally small condensate fraction of 0.016 with the spatial profile of the condensate well described by mean-field theory. Our discovery of this new type of BEC in the purely matter-like exciton system interacting with a cold phonon bath could pave the way for the classification of its long-range order, and for essential understanding of quantum statistical mechanics of non-equilibrium open systems.","Bose-Einstein condensate of excitons is expected in photo-excited bulk semiconductors, but a direct experimental evidence has been lacking.

173,A blind benchmark of analysis tools to infer kinetic rate constants from single-molecule FRET trajectories,"Single-molecule FRET (smFRET) is a versatile technique to study the dynamics and function of biomolecules since it makes nanoscale movements detectable as fluorescence signals. The powerful ability to infer quantitative kinetic information from smFRET data is, however, complicated by experimental limitations. Diverse analysis tools have been developed to overcome these hurdles but a systematic comparison is lacking. Here, we report the results of a blind benchmark study assessing eleven analysis tools used to infer kinetic rate constants from smFRET trajectories. We test them against simulated and experimental data containing the most prominent difficulties encountered in analyzing smFRET experiments: different noise levels, varied model complexity, non-equilibrium dynamics, and kinetic heterogeneity. Our results highlight the current strengths and limitations in inferring kinetic information from smFRET trajectories. In addition, we formulate concrete recommendations and identify key targets for future developments, aimed to advance our understanding of biomolecular dynamics through quantitative experiment-derived models.","The ability to infer quantitative kinetic information from single-molecule FRET (smFRET) data can be challenging.

174,Assembly of transmembrane pores from mirror-image peptides,"Tailored transmembrane alpha-helical pores with desired structural and functional versatility have promising applications in nanobiotechnology. Herein, we present a transmembrane pore DpPorA, based on the natural pore PorACj, built from D-amino acid α-helical peptides. Using single-channel current recordings, we show that DpPorA peptides self-assemble into uniform cation-selective pores in lipid membranes and exhibit properties distinct from their L-amino acid counterparts. DpPorA shows resistance to protease and acts as a functional nanopore sensor to detect cyclic sugars, polypeptides, and polymers. Fluorescence imaging reveals that DpPorA forms well-defined pores in giant unilamellar vesicles facilitating the transport of hydrophilic molecules. A second D-amino acid peptide based on the polysaccharide transporter Wza forms transient pores confirming sequence specificity in stable, functional pore formation. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations reveal the specific alpha-helical packing and surface charge conformation of the D-pores consistent with experimental observations. Our findings will aid the design of sophisticated pores for single-molecule sensing related technologies.","Alpha-helix nanopores have a range of potential applications and the inclusion of non-natural amino acids allows for modification.

175,Multiple parameters shape the 3D chromatin structure of single nuclei at the doc locus in Drosophila,"The spatial organization of chromatin at the scale of topologically associating domains (TADs) and below displays large cell-to-cell variations. Up until now, how this heterogeneity in chromatin conformation is shaped by chromatin condensation, TAD insulation, and transcription has remained mostly elusive. Here, we used Hi-M, a multiplexed DNA-FISH imaging technique providing developmental timing and transcriptional status, to show that the emergence of TADs at the ensemble level partially segregates the conformational space explored by single nuclei during the early development of Drosophila embryos. Surprisingly, a substantial fraction of nuclei display strong insulation even before TADs emerge. Moreover, active transcription within a TAD leads to minor changes to the local inter- and intra-TAD chromatin conformation in single nuclei and only weakly affects insulation to the neighboring TAD. Overall, our results indicate that multiple parameters contribute to shaping the chromatin architecture of single nuclei at the TAD scale.",Here the authors applied their recently developed multiplexed DNA-FISH Hi-M method to dissect the sources of heterogeneity in topologically associating domain (TAD)-like organization during Drosophila embryogenesis. This single-nucleus analysis allows them to reveal that multiple parameters contribute to shaping the trace of the chromatin path from a single nucleus.,2022-09-14
176,Reversible hydrogen spillover in Ru-WO3-x enhances hydrogen evolution activity in neutral pH water splitting,"Noble metal electrocatalysts (e.g., Pt, Ru, etc.) suffer from sluggish kinetics of water dissociation for the electrochemical reduction of water to molecular hydrogen in alkaline and neutral pH environments. Herein, we found that an integration of Ru nanoparticles (NPs) on oxygen-deficient WO3-x manifested a 24.0-fold increase in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity compared with commercial Ru/C electrocatalyst in neutral electrolyte. Oxygen-deficient WO3-x is shown to possess large capacity for storing protons, which could be transferred to the Ru NPs under cathodic potential. This significantly increases the hydrogen coverage on the surface of Ru NPs in HER and thus changes the rate-determining step of HER on Ru from water dissociation to hydrogen recombination.","While water splitting electrolysis offers an appealing means to produce H2 fuel, catalysts show sluggish reaction rate in neutral media. Here, authors utilize hydrogen spillover from oxygen-deficient tungsten oxides to Ru nanoparticles to boost the neutral-pH H2 evolution performances.",2022-09-14
177,Effects of biological sex mismatch on neural progenitor cell transplantation for spinal cord injury in mice,"Despite advancement of neural progenitor cell transplantation to spinal cord injury clinical trials, there remains a lack of understanding of how biological sex of transplanted cells influences outcomes after transplantation. To address this, we transplanted GFP-expressing sex-matched, sex-mismatched, or mixed donor cells into sites of spinal cord injury in adult male and female mice. Biological sex of the donor cells does not influence graft neuron density, glial differentiation, formation of the reactive glial cell border, or graft axon outgrowth. However, male grafts in female hosts feature extensive hypervascularization accompanied by increased vascular diameter and perivascular cell density. We show greater T-cell infiltration within male-to-female grafts than other graft types. Together, these findings indicate a biological sex-specific immune response of female mice to male donor cells. Our work suggests that biological sex should be considered in the design of future clinical trials for cell transplantation in human injury.","In this study, Pitonak et al. report that transplantation of neural progenitor cells derived from male donors trigger an immune rejection response following transplantation into sites of spinal cord injury in female mice.",2022-09-14
178,Structure of an MHC I–tapasin–ERp57 editing complex defines chaperone promiscuity,"Adaptive immunity depends on cell surface presentation of antigenic peptides by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules and on stringent ER quality control in the secretory pathway. The chaperone tapasin in conjunction with the oxidoreductase ERp57 is crucial for MHC I assembly and for shaping the epitope repertoire for high immunogenicity. However, how the tapasin–ERp57 complex engages MHC I clients has not yet been determined at atomic detail. Here, we present the 2.7-Å crystal structure of a tapasin–ERp57 heterodimer in complex with peptide-receptive MHC I. Our study unveils molecular details of client recognition by the multichaperone complex and highlights elements indispensable for peptide proofreading. The structure of this transient ER quality control complex provides the mechanistic basis for the selector function of tapasin and showcases how the numerous MHC I allomorphs are chaperoned during peptide loading and editing.","Adaptive immunity depends on cellular chaperone and quality control systems that are decisive for an effective presentation of foreign antigens via MHC I molecules. Here, the authors present the structure of a key chaperone-MHC I complex.",2022-09-14
179,The clinical drug candidate anle138b binds in a cavity of lipidic α-synuclein fibrils,"Aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins is a characteristic of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Atomic resolution of small molecule binding to such pathological protein aggregates is of interest for the development of therapeutics and diagnostics. Here we investigate the interaction between α-synuclein fibrils and anle138b, a clinical drug candidate for disease modifying therapy in neurodegeneration and a promising scaffold for positron emission tomography tracer design. We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of α-synuclein fibrils grown in the presence of lipids to locate anle138b within a cavity formed between two β-strands. We explored and quantified multiple binding modes of the compound in detail using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal stable polar interactions between anle138b and backbone moieties inside the tubular cavity of the fibrils. Such cavities are common in other fibril structures as well.","Understanding how small molecules bind to pathological aggregates is of importance for therapeutic and diagnostic development in diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease. Here, the authors reveal a binding site of anle138b to lipid-induced α-synuclein fibrils.",2022-09-14
180,Mesoscopic sliding ferroelectricity enabled photovoltaic random access memory for material-level artificial vision system,"Intelligent materials with adaptive response to external stimulation lay foundation to integrate functional systems at the material level. Here, with experimental observation and numerical simulation, we report a delicate nano-electro-mechanical-opto-system naturally embedded in individual multiwall tungsten disulfide nanotubes, which generates a distinct form of in-plane van der Waals sliding ferroelectricity from the unique combination of superlubricity and piezoelectricity. The sliding ferroelectricity enables programmable photovoltaic effect using the multiwall tungsten disulfide nanotube as photovoltaic random-access memory. A complete “four-in-one” artificial vision system that synchronously achieves full functions of detecting, processing, memorizing, and powering is integrated into the nanotube devices. Both labeled supervised learning and unlabeled reinforcement learning algorithms are executable in the artificial vision system to achieve self-driven image recognition. This work provides a distinct strategy to create ferroelectricity in van der Waals materials, and demonstrates how intelligent materials can push electronic system integration at the material level.","Intelligent materials change their properties under external stimuli, integrating functionalities at the matter level. Here, Guo et al. report an artificial vision system based on the memory effect produced by sliding ferroelectricity in multiwalled tungsten disulfide nanotubes.",2022-09-14
181,Understanding Braess’ Paradox in power grids,"The ongoing energy transition requires power grid extensions to connect renewable generators to consumers and to transfer power among distant areas. The process of grid extension requires a large investment of resources and is supposed to make grid operation more robust. Yet, counter-intuitively, increasing the capacity of existing lines or adding new lines may also reduce the overall system performance and even promote blackouts due to Braess’ paradox. Braess’ paradox was theoretically modeled but not yet proven in realistically scaled power grids. Here, we present an experimental setup demonstrating Braess’ paradox in an AC power grid and show how it constrains ongoing large-scale grid extension projects. We present a topological theory that reveals the key mechanism and predicts Braessian grid extensions from the network structure. These results offer a theoretical method to understand and practical guidelines in support of preventing unsuitable infrastructures and the systemic planning of grid extensions.","Increasing the capacity of existing lines or adding new lines in power grids may, counterintuitively, reduce the system performance and promote blackouts. The authors propose an approach for prediction of edges that lower system performance and defining potential constrains for grid extensions.",2022-09-14
182,Mettl3-dependent m6A modification attenuates the brain stress response in Drosophila,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal modification on eukaryotic mRNA, plays an essential role in various stress responses. The brain is uniquely vulnerable to cellular stress, thus defining how m6A sculpts the brain’s susceptibility may provide insight to brain aging and disease-related stress. Here we investigate the impact of m6A mRNA methylation in the adult Drosophila brain with stress. We show that m6A is enriched in the adult brain and increases with heat stress. Through m6A-immunoprecipitation sequencing, we show 5′UTR Mettl3-dependent m6A is enriched in transcripts of neuronal processes and signaling pathways that increase upon stress. Mettl3 knockdown results in increased levels of m6A targets and confers resilience to stress. We find loss of Mettl3 results in decreased levels of nuclear m6A reader Ythdc1, and knockdown of Ythdc1 also leads to stress resilience. Overall, our data suggest that m6A modification in Drosophila dampens the brain’s biological response to stress.","The brain is vulnerable to stress and disease, with much work focused on defining mechanisms that impact the brain’s resilience. Here the author’s reveal in Drosophila that m6A epitranscriptomic modification of RNA dampens the brain’s capacity to mitigate stress by regulating RNA stability and translation.",2022-09-14
183,Telomere-to-telomere genome sequence of the model mould pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus,"The pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is a major etiological agent of fungal invasive and chronic diseases affecting tens of millions of individuals worldwide. Draft genome sequences of two clinical isolates (Af293 and A1163) are commonly used as reference genomes for analyses of clinical and environmental strains. However, the reference sequences lack coverage of centromeres, an accurate sequence for ribosomal repeats, and a comprehensive annotation of chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations and inversions. Here, we used PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT), Oxford Nanopore and Illumina HiSeq sequencing for de novo genome assembly and polishing of two laboratory reference strains of A. fumigatus, CEA10 (parental isolate of A1163) and its descendant A1160. We generated full length chromosome assemblies and a comprehensive telomere-to-telomere coverage for CEA10 and near complete assembly of A1160 including ribosomal repeats and the sequences of centromeres, which we discovered to be composed of long transposon elements. We envision these high-quality reference genomes will become fundamental resources to study A. fumigatus biology, pathogenicity and virulence, and to discover more effective treatments against diseases caused by this fungus.","The fungus Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive and chronic diseases worldwide. Here, Bowyer et al. use long-read and short-read sequencing to generate complete chromosome assemblies and telomere-to-telomere coverage for two isolates, thus providing high-quality reference genomes as fundamental resources to study this pathogen.",2022-09-14
184,Ice mass loss sensitivity to the Antarctic ice sheet basal thermal state,"Sea-level rise projections rely on accurate predictions of ice mass loss from Antarctica. Climate change promotes greater mass loss by destabilizing ice shelves and accelerating the discharge of upstream grounded ice. Mass loss is further exacerbated by mechanisms such as the Marine Ice Sheet Instability and the Marine Ice Cliff Instability. However, the effect of basal thermal state changes of grounded ice remains largely unexplored. Here, we use numerical ice sheet modeling to investigate how warmer basal temperatures could affect the Antarctic ice sheet mass balance. We find increased mass loss in response to idealized basal thawing experiments run over 100 years. Most notably, frozen-bed patches could be tenuously sustaining the current ice configuration in parts of George V, Adélie, Enderby, and Kemp Land regions of East Antarctica. With less than 5 degrees of basal warming, these frozen patches may begin to thaw, producing new loci of mass loss.","This study uses ice sheet modeling experiments to show that thawing portions of the Antarctic ice sheet bed can increase century-scale mass loss, particularly in the Wilkes and Enderby Land regions of East Antarctica.",2022-09-14
185,A pilot study of neoadjuvant combination of anti-PD-1 camrelizumab and VEGFR2 inhibitor apatinib for locally advanced resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma,"Novel neoadjuvant therapy regimens are warranted for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this phase I trial (NCT04393506), 20 patients with locally advanced resectable OSCC receive three cycles of camrelizumab (200 mg, q2w) and apatinib (250 mg, once daily) before surgery. The primary endpoints are safety and major pathological response (MPR, defined as ≤10% residual viable tumour cells). Secondary endpoints include 2-year survival rate and local recurrence rate (not reported due to inadequate follow-up). Exploratory endpoints are the relationships between PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS, defined as the number of PD-L1-stained cells divided by the total number of viable tumour cells, multiplied by 100) and other immunological and genomic biomarkers and response. Neoadjuvant treatment is well-tolerated, and the MPR rate is 40% (8/20), meeting the primary endpoint. All five patients with CPS ˃10 achieve MPR. Post-hoc analysis show 18-month locoregional recurrence and survival rates of 10.5% (95% CI: 0%–24.3%) and 95% (95% CI: 85.4%–100.0%), respectively. Patients achieving MPR show more CD4+ T-cell infiltration than those without MPR (P = 0.02), and decreased CD31 and ɑ-SMA expression levels are observed after neoadjuvant therapy. In conclusion, neoadjuvant camrelizumab and apatinib is safe and yields a promising MPR rate for OSCC.","In patients with locally advanced resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the risk of recurrence and metastasis following treatment is high. Here, a phase I clinical trial reports safety and pathological response of neoadjuvant camrelizumab and apatinib in patients with locally advanced resectable OSCC.",2022-09-14
186,Structural basis for APE1 processing DNA damage in the nucleosome,"Genomic DNA is continually exposed to endogenous and exogenous factors that promote DNA damage. Eukaryotic genomic DNA is packaged into nucleosomes, which present a barrier to accessing and effectively repairing DNA damage. The mechanisms by which DNA repair proteins overcome this barrier to repair DNA damage in the nucleosome and protect genomic stability is unknown. Here, we determine how the base excision repair (BER) endonuclease AP-endonuclease 1 (APE1) recognizes and cleaves DNA damage in the nucleosome. Kinetic assays determine that APE1 cleaves solvent-exposed AP sites in the nucleosome with 3 − 6 orders of magnitude higher efficiency than occluded AP sites. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of APE1 bound to a nucleosome containing a solvent-exposed AP site reveal that APE1 uses a DNA sculpting mechanism for AP site recognition, where APE1 bends the nucleosomal DNA to access the AP site. Notably, additional biochemical and structural characterization of occluded AP sites identify contacts between the nucleosomal DNA and histone octamer that prevent efficient processing of the AP site by APE1. These findings provide a rationale for the position-dependent activity of BER proteins in the nucleosome and suggests the ability of BER proteins to sculpt nucleosomal DNA drives efficient BER in chromatin.","AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) processes genomic AP sites during base excision repair. Here, the authors determine the structural mechanism used by APE1 to process nucleosomal AP sites, providing new insight into DNA repair in chromatin.",2022-09-14
187,Flying electron spin control gates,"The control of ""flying” (or moving) spin qubits is an important functionality for the manipulation and exchange of quantum information between remote locations on a chip. Typically, gates based on electric or magnetic fields provide the necessary perturbation for their control either globally or at well-defined locations. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic control of moving electron spins via contactless gates that move together with the spins. The concept is realized using electron spins trapped and transported by moving potential dots defined by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). The SAW strain at the electron trapping site, which is set by the SAW amplitude, acts as a contactless, tunable gate that controls the precession frequency of the flying spins via the spin-orbit interaction. We show that the degree of precession control in moving dots exceeds previously reported results for unconstrained transport by an order of magnitude and is well accounted for by a theoretical model for the strain contribution to the spin-orbit interaction. This flying spin gate permits the realization of an acoustically driven optical polarization modulator based on electron spin transport, a key element for on-chip spin information processing with a photonic interface.","Spin qubits are a platform for quantum computing. There are many advantages for quantum information processing if the spin qubit can move. Here, Helgers et al. use a surface acoustic wave to define a moving quantum dot and demonstrate the magneticfield-free control of the spin precession, bringing “flying” spin qubits a step closer.",2022-09-14
188,Condensation droplet sieve,"Large droplets emerging during dropwise condensation impair surface properties such as anti-fogging/frosting ability and heat transfer efficiency. How to spontaneously detach massive randomly distributed droplets with controlled sizes has remained a challenge. Herein, we present a solution called condensation droplet sieve, through fabricating microscale thin-walled lattice structures coated with a superhydrophobic layer. Growing droplets were observed to jump off this surface once becoming slightly larger than the lattices. The maximum radius and residual volume of droplets were strictly confined to 16 μm and 3.2 nl/mm2 respectively. We reveal that this droplet radius cut off is attributed to the large tolerance of coalescence mismatch for jumping and effective isolation of droplets between neighboring lattices. Our work brings forth a strategy for the design and fabrication of high-performance anti-dew materials.","Spontaneous droplet jumping and control of dropwise condensation are relevant for water-harvesting, heat transfer and anti-frosting applications. The authors design a superhydrophobic surface with microscale thin-walled lattice structure to achieve effective jumping of droplets with specified radius range.",2022-09-14
189,Mild dyslipidemia accelerates tumorigenesis through expansion of Ly6Chi monocytes and differentiation to pro-angiogenic myeloid cells,"Cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) share common risk factors such as dyslipidemia, obesity and inflammation. However, the role of pro-atherogenic environment and its associated low-grade inflammation in tumor progression remains underexplored. Here we show that feeding C57BL/6J mice with a non-obesogenic high fat high cholesterol diet (HFHCD) for two weeks to induce mild dyslipidemia, increases the pool of circulating Ly6Chi monocytes available for initial melanoma development, in an IL-1β-dependent manner. Descendants of circulating myeloid cells, which accumulate in the tumor microenvironment of mice under HFHCD, heighten pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive activities locally. Limiting myeloid cell accumulation or targeting VEGF-A production by myeloid cells decrease HFHCD-induced tumor growth acceleration. Reverting the HFHCD to a chow diet at the time of tumor implantation protects against tumor growth. Together, these data shed light on cross-disease communication between cardiovascular pathologies and cancer.","Obesity and inflammation have been associated to cancer progression. Here, the authors show that high fat and cholesterol diet, in a non-obese context, promotes tumourigenesis through increasing inflammatory monocytes and myeloid-derived pro-angiogenic factors.",2022-09-14
190,Optical quantum super-resolution imaging and hypothesis testing,"Estimating the angular separation between two incoherent thermal sources is a challenging task for direct imaging, especially at lengths within the diffraction limit. Moreover, detecting the presence of multiple sources of different brightness is an even more severe challenge. We experimentally demonstrate two tasks for super-resolution imaging based on hypothesis testing and quantum metrology techniques. We can significantly reduce the error probability for detecting a weak secondary source, even for small separations. We reduce the experimental complexity to a simple interferometer: we show (1) our set-up is optimal for the state discrimination task, and (2) if the two sources are equally bright, then this measurement can super-resolve their angular separation. Using a collection baseline of 5.3 mm, we resolve the angular separation of two sources placed 15 μm apart at a distance of 1.0 m with a 1.7% accuracy - an almost 3-orders-of-magnitude improvement over shot-noise limited direct imaging.",Estimating the angular separation between two incoherent sources below the diffraction limit is challenging. Hypothesis testing and quantum state discrimination techniques are used to super-resolve sources of different brightness with a simple optical interferometer.,2022-09-13
191,Fatty acid metabolism in aggressive B-cell lymphoma is inhibited by tetraspanin CD37,"The importance of fatty acid (FA) metabolism in cancer is well-established, yet the mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming remain elusive. Here, we identify tetraspanin CD37, a prognostic marker for aggressive B-cell lymphoma, as essential membrane-localized inhibitor of FA metabolism. Deletion of CD37 on lymphoma cells results in increased FA oxidation shown by functional assays and metabolomics. Furthermore, CD37-negative lymphomas selectively deplete palmitate from serum in mouse studies. Mechanistically, CD37 inhibits the FA transporter FATP1 through molecular interaction. Consequently, deletion of CD37 induces uptake and processing of exogenous palmitate into energy and essential building blocks for proliferation, and inhibition of FATP1 reverses this phenotype. Large lipid deposits and intracellular lipid droplets are observed in CD37-negative lymphoma tissues of patients. Moreover, inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 A significantly compromises viability and proliferation of CD37-deficient lymphomas. Collectively, our results identify CD37 as a direct gatekeeper of the FA metabolic switch in aggressive B-cell lymphoma.","Tetraspanin CD37 deficiency has been reported as a prognostic marker for aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Here, the authors show that CD37 interacts with the fatty acid transporter 1 to inhibit palmitate uptake and its deficiency leads to increased fatty acid metabolism which promotes tumorigenesis in B-cell lymphoma.",2022-09-13
192,Interleukin-1 contributes to clonal expansion and progression of bone marrow fibrosis in JAK2V617F-induced myeloproliferative neoplasm,"Chronic inflammation is frequently associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), but the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of MPN remains unclear. Expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is elevated in patients with MPN as well as in Jak2V617F knock-in mice. Here, we show that genetic deletion of IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) normalizes peripheral blood counts, reduces splenomegaly and ameliorates bone marrow fibrosis in homozygous Jak2V617F mouse model of myelofibrosis. Deletion of IL-1R1 also significantly reduces Jak2V617F mutant hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Exogenous administration of IL-1β enhances myeloid cell expansion and accelerates the development of bone marrow fibrosis in heterozygous Jak2V617F mice. Furthermore, treatment with anti-IL-1R1 antibodies significantly reduces leukocytosis and splenomegaly, and ameliorates bone marrow fibrosis in homozygous Jak2V617F mice. Collectively, these results suggest that IL-1 signaling plays a pathogenic role in MPN disease progression, and targeting of IL-1R1 could be a useful strategy for the treatment of myelofibrosis.","Chronic inflammation is frequently observed in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Here the authors observe elevated levels of IL-1α and IL-1β in MPN patients and show that IL-1 contributes to clonal expansion and bone marrow fibrosis in a mouse model of MPN, proposing targeting of IL1R1 as therapeutic intervention.",2022-09-13
193,Wide field imaging of van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 by spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride,"Emergent color centers with accessible spins hosted by van der Waals materials have attracted substantial interest in recent years due to their significant potential for implementing transformative quantum sensing technologies. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is naturally relevant in this context due to its remarkable ease of integration into devices consisting of low-dimensional materials. Taking advantage of boron vacancy spin defects in hBN, we report nanoscale quantum imaging of low-dimensional ferromagnetism sustained in Fe3GeTe2/hBN van der Waals heterostructures. Exploiting spin relaxometry methods, we have further observed spatially varying magnetic fluctuations in the exfoliated Fe3GeTe2 flake, whose magnitude reaches a peak value around the Curie temperature. Our results demonstrate the capability of spin defects in hBN of investigating local magnetic properties of layered materials in an accessible and precise way, which can be extended readily to a broad range of miniaturized van der Waals heterostructure systems.","Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been used extensively to encapsulate other van der Waals materials, protecting them from environmental degradation, and allowing integration into more complex heterostructures.

194,Forest expansion dominates China’s land carbon sink since 1980,"Carbon budget accounting relies heavily on Food and Agriculture Organization land-use data reported by governments. Here we develop a new land-use and cover-change database for China, finding that differing historical survey methods biased China’s reported data causing large errors in Food and Agriculture Organization databases. Land ecosystem model simulations driven with the new data reveal a strong carbon sink of 8.9 ± 0.8 Pg carbon from 1980 to 2019 in China, which was not captured in Food and Agriculture Organization data-based estimations due to biased land-use and cover-change signals. The land-use and cover-change in China, characterized by a rapid forest expansion from 1980 to 2019, contributed to nearly 44% of the national terrestrial carbon sink. In contrast, climate changes (22.3%), increasing nitrogen deposition (12.9%), and rising carbon dioxide (8.1%) are less important contributors. This indicates that previous studies have greatly underestimated the impact of land-use and cover-change on the terrestrial carbon balance of China. This study underlines the importance of reliable land-use and cover-change databases in global carbon budget accounting.",The impact of land-use and cover-change (LUCC) on ecosystem carbon stock in China is poorly known due to large biases in existing databases. Here the authors develop a new LUCC database with corrected false signals and reveal that forest expansion is the dominant driver of China’s recent carbon sink.,2022-09-13
195,Enhanced Arctic sea ice melting controlled by larger heat discharge of mid-Holocene rivers,"Arctic sea ice retreat is linked to extrapolar thermal energy import, while the potential impact of pan-Arctic river heat discharge on sea-ice loss has been unresolved. We reconstructed the Holocene history of Arctic sea ice and Russian pan-Arctic river heat discharge, combining ice-rafted debris records and sedimentation rates from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf with a compilation of published paleoclimate and observational data. In the mid-Holocene, the early summer (June–July) solar insolation was higher than that during the late Holocene, which led to a larger heat discharge of the Russian pan-Arctic rivers and contributed to more Arctic sea ice retreat. This intensified decline of early-summer sea ice accelerated the melting of sea ice throughout the summertime by lowering regional albedos. Our findings highlight the important impact of the larger heat discharge of pan-Arctic rivers, which can reinforce Arctic sea-ice loss in the summer in the context of global warming.","Based on marine multiproxy records, a new study outlines the role of larger heat discharge of the pan-Arctic Rivers in determining the pronounced sea ice retreat over the East Siberian Arctic Shelf in the mid-Holocene.",2022-09-13
196,High-fluence and high-gain multilayer focusing optics to enhance spatial resolution in femtosecond X-ray laser imaging,"With the emergence of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) has acquired a capability for single-particle imaging (SPI) of non-crystalline objects under non-cryogenic conditions. However, the single-shot spatial resolution is limited to ~5 nanometres primarily because of insufficient fluence. Here, we present a CDI technique whereby high resolution is achieved with very-high-fluence X-ray focusing using multilayer mirrors with nanometre precision. The optics can focus 4-keV XFEL down to 60 nm × 110 nm and realize a fluence of >3 × 105 J cm−2 pulse−1 or >4 × 1012 photons μm−2 pulse−1 with a tenfold increase in the total gain compared to conventional optics due to the high demagnification. Further, the imaging of fixed-target metallic nanoparticles in solution attained an unprecedented 2-nm resolution in single-XFEL-pulse exposure. These findings can further expand the capabilities of SPI to explore the relationships between dynamic structures and functions of native biomolecular complexes.","Here, the authors realize an ultra-high fluence X-ray laser by high-gain multilayer focusing optics. This enables in-solution imaging with 2-nm resolution in a single-pulse exposure, making strides toward biomolecular imaging under physiological conditions.",2022-09-13
197,Inhibition of interleukin-1β reduces myelofibrosis and osteosclerosis in mice with JAK2-V617F driven myeloproliferative neoplasm,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a master regulator of inflammation. Increased activity of IL-1β has been implicated in various pathological conditions including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Here we show that IL-1β serum levels and expression of IL-1 receptors on hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells correlate with JAK2-V617F mutant allele fraction in peripheral blood of patients with MPN. We show that the source of IL-1β overproduction in a mouse model of MPN are JAK2-V617F expressing hematopoietic cells. Knockout of IL-1β in hematopoietic cells of JAK2-V617F mice reduces inflammatory cytokines, prevents damage to nestin-positive niche cells and reduces megakaryopoiesis, resulting in decrease of myelofibrosis and osteosclerosis. Inhibition of IL-1β in JAK2-V617F mutant mice by anti-IL-1β antibody also reduces myelofibrosis and osteosclerosis and shows additive effects with ruxolitinib. These results suggest that inhibition of IL-1β with anti-IL-1β antibody alone or in combination with ruxolitinib could have beneficial effects on the clinical course in patients with myelofibrosis.",Inflammatory cytokines are elevated in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Here the authors show that the JAK2-V617F mutation is associated with increased expression of IL-1 in MPN patients and that loss of IL-1β in JAK2-V617F mutant hematopoietic cells reduces MPN symptoms and myelofibrosis in a mouse model.,2022-09-13
198,Diverse cell-specific patterns of alternative polyadenylation in Drosophila,"Most genes in higher eukaryotes express isoforms with distinct 3’ untranslated regions (3’ UTRs), generated by alternative polyadenylation (APA). Since 3’ UTRs are predominant locations of post-transcriptional regulation, APA can render such programs conditional, and can also alter protein sequences via alternative last exon (ALE) isoforms. We previously used 3’-sequencing from diverse Drosophila samples to define multiple tissue-specific APA landscapes. Here, we exploit comprehensive single nucleus RNA-sequencing data (Fly Cell Atlas) to elucidate cell-type expression of 3’ UTRs across >250 adult Drosophila cell types. We reveal the cellular bases of multiple tissue-specific APA/ALE programs, such as 3’ UTR lengthening in differentiated neurons and 3’ UTR shortening in spermatocytes and spermatids. We trace dynamic 3’ UTR patterns across cell lineages, including in the male germline, and discover new APA patterns in the intestinal stem cell lineage. Finally, we correlate expression of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), miRNAs and global levels of cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) factors in several cell types that exhibit characteristic APA landscapes, yielding candidate regulators of transcriptome complexity. These analyses provide a comprehensive foundation for future investigations of mechanisms and biological impacts of alternative 3’ isoforms across the major cell types of this widely-studied model organism.","Single cell data provides cellular resolution on gene expression, but is rarely mined for isoforms. Analysis of 3' isoforms across ~250 Drosophila cell types reveals the cellular bases for numerous tissue-specific 3' programs, identifies new 3' programs, and nominates candidate trans-acting factors",2022-09-13
199,A platform for blue-luminescent carbon-centered radicals,"Organic radicals, which have unique doublet spin-configuration, provide an alternative method to overcome the efficiency limitation of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on conventional fluorescent organic molecules. Further, they have made great breakthroughs in deep-red and near-infrared OLEDs. However, it is difficult to extend their fluorescence into a short-wavelength region because of the natural narrow bandgap of the organic radicals. Herein, we significantly expand the scope of luminescent radicals by showing a new platform of carbon-centered radicals derived from N-heterocyclic carbenes that produce blue to green emissions (444–529 nm). Time-dependent density functional theory calculations and experimental investigations disclose that the fluorescence originates from the high-energy excited states to the ground state, demonstrating an anti-Kasha behavior. The present work provides an efficient and modular approach toward a library of carbon-centered radicals that feature anti-Kasha’s rule emission, rendering them as potential new emitters in the short-wavelength region.","Organic radicals, which have unique doublet spin-configuration, provide an alternative method to overcome the efficiency limitation of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) but extending their fluorescence into a short-wavelength region remains challenging.

200,Paternal imprinting of dosage-effect defective1 contributes to seed weight xenia in maize,"Historically, xenia effects were hypothesized to be unique genetic contributions of pollen to seed phenotype, but most examples represent standard complementation of Mendelian traits. We identified the imprinted dosage-effect defective1 (ded1) locus in maize (Zea mays) as a paternal regulator of seed size and development. Hypomorphic alleles show a 5–10% seed weight reduction when ded1 is transmitted through the male, while homozygous mutants are defective with a 70–90% seed weight reduction. Ded1 encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor expressed specifically during early endosperm development with paternal allele bias. DED1 directly activates early endosperm genes and endosperm adjacent to scutellum cell layer genes, while directly repressing late grain-fill genes. These results demonstrate xenia as originally defined: Imprinting of Ded1 causes the paternal allele to set the pace of endosperm development thereby influencing grain set and size.",Xenia effects describe the genetic contribution of pollen to seed phenotypes. Here the authors show that paternal imprinting of Ded1 contributes to the xenia effect in maize by setting the pace of endosperm development.,2022-09-13
201,Localized interlayer excitons in MoSe2–WSe2 heterostructures without a moiré potential,"Interlayer excitons (IXs) in MoSe2–WSe2 heterobilayers have generated interest as highly tunable light emitters in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures. Previous reports of spectrally narrow (<1 meV) photoluminescence (PL) emission lines at low temperature have been attributed to IXs localized by the moiré potential between the TMD layers. We show that spectrally narrow IX PL lines are present even when the moiré potential is suppressed by inserting a bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spacer between the TMD layers. We compare the doping, electric field, magnetic field, and temperature dependence of IXs in a directly contacted MoSe2–WSe2 region to those in a region separated by bilayer hBN. The doping, electric field, and temperature dependence of the narrow IX lines are similar for both regions, but their excitonic g-factors have opposite signs, indicating that the origin of narrow IX PL is not the moiré potential.","The spectrally narrow photoluminescence lines occurring in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) heterostructures at low temperature have been attributed to interlayer excitons (IXs) localized by the moiré potential between the TMD layers.

202,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, DNA methylation, and risk for coronary artery disease","Age-related changes to the genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) pattern observed in blood are well-documented. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), characterized by the age-related acquisition and expansion of leukemogenic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), is associated with blood cancer and coronary artery disease (CAD). Epigenetic regulators DNMT3A and TET2 are the two most frequently mutated CHIP genes. Here, we present results from an epigenome-wide association study for CHIP in 582 Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) participants, with replication in 2655 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study participants. We show that DNMT3A and TET2 CHIP have distinct and directionally opposing genome-wide DNAm association patterns consistent with their regulatory roles, albeit both promoting self-renewal of HSCs. Mendelian randomization analyses indicate that a subset of DNAm alterations associated with these two leading CHIP genes may promote the risk for CAD.","Clonal hematopoiesis, often caused by mutations in DNMT3A and TET2, is associated with blood cancer and coronary artery disease. Here, the authors conduct an epigenome-wide association study, finding that clonal hematopoiesis caused by DNMT3A vs. TET2 mutations has directionally opposing changes in DNA methylation profiles, with both promoting stem cell self-renewal.",2022-09-12
203,Robust data storage in DNA by de Bruijn graph-based de novo strand assembly,"DNA data storage is a rapidly developing technology with great potential due to its high density, long-term durability, and low maintenance cost. The major technical challenges include various errors, such as strand breaks, rearrangements, and indels that frequently arise during DNA synthesis, amplification, sequencing, and preservation. In this study, a de novo strand assembly algorithm (DBGPS) is developed using de Bruijn graph and greedy path search to meet these challenges. DBGPS shows substantial advantages in handling DNA breaks, rearrangements, and indels. The robustness of DBGPS is demonstrated by accelerated aging, multiple independent data retrievals, deep error-prone PCR, and large-scale simulations. Remarkably, 6.8 MB of data is accurately recovered from a severely corrupted sample that has been treated at 70 °C for 70 days. With DBGPS, we are able to achieve a logical density of 1.30 bits/cycle and a physical density of 295 PB/g.","DNA data storage is a rapidly developing technology with great potential due to its high density, long-term durability, and low maintenance cost.

204,Depletable peroxidase-like activity of Fe3O4 nanozymes accompanied with separate migration of electrons and iron ions,"As pioneering Fe3O4 nanozymes, their explicit peroxidase (POD)-like catalytic mechanism remains elusive. Although many studies have proposed surface Fe2+-induced Fenton-like reactions accounting for their POD-like activity, few have focused on the internal atomic changes and their contribution to the catalytic reaction. Here we report that Fe2+ within Fe3O4 can transfer electrons to the surface via the Fe2+-O-Fe3+ chain, regenerating the surface Fe2+ and enabling a sustained POD-like catalytic reaction. This process usually occurs with the outward migration of excess oxidized Fe3+ from the lattice, which is a rate-limiting step. After prolonged catalysis, Fe3O4 nanozymes suffer the phase transformation to γ-Fe2O3 with depletable POD-like activity. This self-depleting characteristic of nanozymes with internal atoms involved in electron transfer and ion migration is well validated on lithium iron phosphate nanoparticles. We reveal a neglected issue concerning the necessity of considering both surface and internal atoms when designing, modulating, and applying nanozymes.","The mechanism of peroxidase-like Fe3O4 nanozymes remains elusive. Here, the authors show the electron transfer mechanism of Fe(II) ions to regenerate surface Fe(II) and the related phase transformation and depletion of activity.",2022-09-12
205,Microgel reinforced zwitterionic hydrogel coating for blood-contacting biomedical devices,"Zwitterionic hydrogels exhibit eminent nonfouling and hemocompatibility. Several key challenges hinder their application as coating materials for blood-contacting biomedical devices, including weak mechanical strength and low adhesion to the substrate. Here, we report a poly(carboxybetaine) microgel reinforced poly(sulfobetaine) (pCBM/pSB) pure zwitterionic hydrogel with excellent mechanical robustness and anti-swelling properties. The pCBM/pSB hydrogel coating was bonded to the PVC substrate via the entanglement network between the pSB and PVC chain. Moreover, the pCBM/pSB hydrogel coating can maintain favorable stability even after 21 d PBS shearing, 0.5 h strong water flushing, 1000 underwater bends, and 100 sandpaper abrasions. Notably, the pCBM/pSB hydrogel coated PVC tubing can not only mitigate the foreign body response but also prevent thrombus formation ex vivo in rats and rabbits blood circulation without anticoagulants. This work provides new insights to guide the design of pure zwitterionic hydrogel coatings for biomedical devices.","Zwitterionic hydrogels are nonfouling and hemocompatibility but several key challenges such as weak mechanical strength and low adhesion hamper their application as coating materials for devices.

206,Identification of a binding site on soluble RANKL that can be targeted to inhibit soluble RANK-RANKL interactions and treat osteoporosis,"One of the major challenges for discovering protein-protein interaction inhibitors is identifying selective and druggable binding sites at the protein surface. Here, we report an approach to identify a small molecular binding site to selectively inhibit the interaction of soluble RANKL and RANK for designing anti-osteoporosis drugs without undesirable immunosuppressive effects. Through molecular dynamic simulations, we discovered a binding site that allows a small molecule to selectively interrupt soluble RANKL-RANK interaction and without interfering with the membrane RANKL-RANK interaction. We describe a highly potent inhibitor, S3-15, and demonstrate its specificity to inhibit the soluble RANKL-RANK interaction with in vitro and in vivo studies. S3-15 exhibits anti-osteoporotic effects without causing immunosuppression. Through in silico and in vitro experiments we further confirm the binding model of S3-15 and soluble RANKL. This work might inspire structure-based drug discovery for targeting protein-protein interactions.",Huang et al. discover a binding site on soluble RANKL that is not found on its membrane-bound homologue.

207,GCAF(TMEM251) regulates lysosome biogenesis by activating the mannose-6-phosphate pathway,"The mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) biosynthetic pathway for lysosome biogenesis has been studied for decades and is considered a well-understood topic. However, whether this pathway is regulated remains an open question. In a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen, we discover TMEM251 as the first regulator of the M6P modification. Deleting TMEM251 causes mistargeting of most lysosomal enzymes due to their loss of M6P modification and accumulation of numerous undigested materials. We further demonstrate that TMEM251 localizes to the Golgi and is required for the cleavage and activity of GNPT, the enzyme that catalyzes M6P modification. In zebrafish, TMEM251 deletion leads to severe developmental defects including heart edema and skeletal dysplasia, which phenocopies Mucolipidosis Type II. Our discovery provides a mechanism for the newly discovered human disease caused by TMEM251 mutations. We name TMEM251 as GNPTAB cleavage and activity factor (GCAF) and its related disease as Mucolipidosis Type V.","Lysosomal biogenesis errors often result in diseases including mucolipidosis. Here Zhang and Yang et al. identify TMEM251/GCAF as a mannose-6-phosphate modification regulator that is necessary for correct lysosomal targeting, and classify Mucolipidosis Type V as resulting from GCAF mutations.",2022-09-12
208,An analysis modality for vascular structures combining tissue-clearing technology and topological data analysis,"The blood and lymphatic vasculature networks are not yet fully understood even in mouse because of the inherent limitations of imaging systems and quantification methods. This study aims to evaluate the usefulness of the tissue-clearing technology for visualizing blood and lymphatic vessels in adult mouse. Clear, unobstructed brain/body imaging cocktails and computational analysis (CUBIC) enables us to capture the high-resolution 3D images of organ- or area-specific vascular structures. To evaluate these 3D structural images, signals are first classified from the original captured images by machine learning at pixel base. Then, these classified target signals are subjected to topological data analysis and non-homogeneous Poisson process model to extract geometric features. Consequently, the structural difference of vasculatures is successfully evaluated in mouse disease models. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the utility of CUBIC for analysis of vascular structures and presents its feasibility as an analysis modality in combination with 3D images and mathematical frameworks.","Understanding blood and lymphatic vasculature networks is currently limited by existing imaging systems and quantification methods. Here the authors use the tissue clearing method CUBIC to generate 3D images, machine learning to capture the signals, and extract geometric features by topological data analysis.",2022-09-12
209,Improved immunoassay sensitivity and specificity using single-molecule colocalization,"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are a cornerstone of modern molecular detection, but the technique still faces notable challenges. One of the biggest problems is discriminating true signal generated by target molecules versus non-specific background. Here, we developed a Single-Molecule Colocalization Assay (SiMCA) that overcomes this problem by employing total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to quantify target proteins based on the colocalization of fluorescent signal from orthogonally labeled capture and detection antibodies. By specifically counting colocalized signals, we can eliminate the effects of background produced by non-specific binding of detection antibodies. Using TNF-α, we show that SiMCA achieves a three-fold lower limit of detection compared to conventional single-color assays and exhibits consistent performance for assays performed in complex specimens such as serum and blood. Our results help define the pernicious effects of non-specific background in immunoassays and demonstrate the diagnostic gains that can be achieved by eliminating those effects.","A major challenge of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays is discriminating true signal from non-specific binding. Here the authors present a Single-Molecule Colocalization Assay (SiMCA) which eliminates such effects, enabling reproducible detection of picomolar protein concentrations.",2022-09-12
210,Annihilation of exceptional points from different Dirac valleys in a 2D photonic system,"Topological physics relies on Hamiltonian’s eigenstate singularities carrying topological charges, such as Dirac points, and – in non-Hermitian systems – exceptional points (EPs), lines or surfaces. So far, the reported non-Hermitian topological transitions were related to the creation of a pair of EPs connected by a Fermi arc out of a single Dirac point by increasing non-Hermiticity. Such EPs can annihilate by reducing non-Hermiticity. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that an increase of non-Hermiticity can lead to the annihilation of EPs issued from different Dirac points (valleys). The studied platform is a liquid crystal microcavity with voltage-controlled birefringence and TE-TM photonic spin-orbit-coupling. Non-Hermiticity is provided by polarization-dependent losses. By increasing the non-Hermiticity degree, we control the position of the EPs. After the intervalley annihilation, the system becomes free of any band singularity. Our results open the field of non-Hermitian valley-physics and illustrate connections between Hermitian topology and non-Hermitian phase transitions.","The authors study a liquid crystal microcavity with polarization-dependent absorption, a source of non-Hermiticity. The transition in the Hermitian topology of the spin-orbit coupling makes possible the annihilation of exceptional points.",2022-09-12
211,Strong influence of north Pacific Ocean variability on Indian summer heatwaves,"Increased occurrence of heatwaves across different parts of the world is one of the characteristic signatures of anthropogenic warming. With a 1.3 billion population, India is one of the hot spots that experience deadly heatwaves during May-June – yet the large-scale physical mechanism and teleconnection patterns driving such events remain poorly understood. Here using observations and controlled climate model experiments, we demonstrate a significant footprint of the far-reaching Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM) on the heatwave intensity (and duration) across North Central India (NCI) – the high risk region prone to heatwaves. A strong positive phase of PMM leads to a significant increase in heatwave intensity and duration over NCI (0.8-2 °C and 3–6 days; p < 0.05) and vice-versa. The current generation (CMIP6) climate models that adequately capture the PMM and their responses to NCI heatwaves, project significantly higher intensities of future heatwaves (0.5-1 °C; p < 0.05) compared to all model ensembles. These differences in the intensities of heatwaves could significantly increase the mortality (by ≈150%) and therefore can have substantial implications on designing the mitigation and adaptation strategies.",New study finds that Summer Indian heatwaves are controlled by the large scale atmospheric circulation associated with the Pacific Meridional Mode.,2022-09-12
212,A high-performance genetically encoded fluorescent indicator for in vivo cAMP imaging,"cAMP is a key second messenger that regulates diverse cellular functions including neural plasticity. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular cAMP in intact organisms are largely unknown due to low sensitivity and/or brightness of current genetically encoded fluorescent cAMP indicators. Here, we report the development of the new circularly permuted GFP (cpGFP)-based cAMP indicator G-Flamp1, which exhibits a large fluorescence increase (a maximum ΔF/F0 of 1100% in HEK293T cells), decent brightness, appropriate affinity (a Kd of 2.17 μM) and fast response kinetics (an association and dissociation half-time of 0.20 and 0.087 s, respectively). Furthermore, the crystal structure of the cAMP-bound G-Flamp1 reveals one linker connecting the cAMP-binding domain to cpGFP adopts a distorted β-strand conformation that may serve as a fluorescence modulation switch. We demonstrate that G-Flamp1 enables sensitive monitoring of endogenous cAMP signals in brain regions that are implicated in learning and motor control in living organisms such as fruit flies and mice.","The second messenger cAMP modulates a wide range of important biological processes. Here, the authors developed a fluorescent indicator termed G-Flamp1, which can accurately report levels of cAMP in living cells.",2022-09-12
213,Kinetic compartmentalization by unnatural reaction for itaconate production,"Physical compartmentalization of metabolism using membranous organelles in eukaryotes is helpful for chemical biosynthesis to ensure the availability of substrates from competitive metabolic reactions. Bacterial hosts lack such a membranous system, which is one of the major limitations for efficient metabolic engineering. Here, we employ kinetic compartmentalization with the introduction of an unnatural enzymatic reaction by an engineered enzyme as an alternative strategy to enable substrate availability from competitive reactions through kinetic isolation of metabolic pathways. As a proof of concept, we kinetically isolate the itaconate synthetic pathway from the tricarboxylic acid cycle in Escherichia coli, which is natively separated by mitochondrial membranes in Aspergillus terreus. Specifically, 2-methylcitrate dehydratase is engineered to alternatively catalyze citrate and kinetically secure cis-aconitate for efficient production using a high-throughput screening system. Itaconate production can be significantly improved with kinetic compartmentalization and its strategy has the potential to be widely applicable.","Unlike eukaryotic system, bacterial hosts lack membranous system, which is one of the limitations for efficient metabolic engineering. Here, the authors report a kinetic compartmentalization strategy to increase substrate availability from competitive reactions for the efficient production of itaconate in E. coli.",2022-09-12
214,No evidence of brown adipose tissue activation after 24 weeks of supervised exercise training in young sedentary adults in the ACTIBATE randomized controlled trial,"Exercise modulates both brown adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning in murine models. Whether this is true in humans, however, has remained unknown. An unblinded randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02365129) was therefore conducted to study the effects of a 24-week supervised exercise intervention, combining endurance and resistance training, on BAT volume and activity (primary outcome). The study was carried out in the Sport and Health University Research Institute and the Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital of the University of Granada (Spain). One hundred and forty-five young sedentary adults were assigned to either (i) a control group (no exercise, n = 54), (ii) a moderate intensity exercise group (MOD-EX, n = 48), or (iii) a vigorous intensity exercise group (VIG-EX n = 43) by unrestricted randomization. No relevant adverse events were recorded. 97 participants (34 men, 63 women) were included in the final analysis (Control; n = 35, MOD-EX; n = 31, and VIG-EX; n = 31). We observed no changes in BAT volume (Δ Control: −22.2 ± 52.6 ml; Δ MOD-EX: −15.5 ± 62.1 ml, Δ VIG-EX: −6.8 ± 66.4 ml; P = 0.771) or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (SUVpeak Δ Control: −2.6 ± 3.1 ml; Δ MOD-EX: −1.2 ± 4.8, Δ VIG-EX: −2.2 ± 5.1; p = 0.476) in either the control or the exercise groups. Thus, we did not find any evidence of an exercise-induced change on BAT volume or activity in young sedentary adults.",Exercise modulates brown adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism in murine models.

215,Integrated Pockels laser,"The development of integrated semiconductor lasers has miniaturized traditional bulky laser systems, enabling a wide range of photonic applications. A progression from pure III-V based lasers to III-V/external cavity structures has harnessed low-loss waveguides in different material systems, leading to significant improvements in laser coherence and stability. Despite these successes, however, key functions remain absent. In this work, we address a critical missing function by integrating the Pockels effect into a semiconductor laser. Using a hybrid integrated III-V/Lithium Niobate structure, we demonstrate several essential capabilities that have not existed in previous integrated lasers. These include a record-high frequency modulation speed of 2 exahertz/s (2.0 × 1018 Hz/s) and fast switching at 50 MHz, both of which are made possible by integration of the electro-optic effect. Moreover, the device co-lases at infrared and visible frequencies via the second-harmonic frequency conversion process, the first such integrated multi-color laser. Combined with its narrow linewidth and wide tunability, this new type of integrated laser holds promise for many applications including LiDAR, microwave photonics, atomic physics, and AR/VR.",On-Chip integration of laser systems led to impressive development in many field of application like LIDAR or AR/VR to cite a few.

216,Diesel soot photooxidation enhances the heterogeneous formation of H2SO4,"Both field observation and experimental simulation have implied that black carbon or soot plays a remarkable role in the catalytic oxidation of SO2 for the formation of atmospheric sulfate. However, the catalytic mechanism remains ambiguous, especially that under light irradiation. Here we systematically investigate the heterogeneous conversion of SO2 on diesel soot or black carbon (DBC) under light irradiation. The experimental results show that the presence of DBC under light irradiation can significantly promote the heterogeneous conversion of SO2 to H2SO4, mainly through the heterogeneous reaction between SO2 and photo-induced OH radicals. The detected photo-chemical behaviors on DBC suggest that OH radical formation is closely related to the abstraction and transfer of electrons in DBC and the formation of reactive superoxide radical (•O2−) as an intermediate. Our results extend the known sources of atmospheric H2SO4 and provide insight into the internal photochemical oxidation mechanism of SO2 on DBC.","Potential source of H2SO4 remains unclear in the atmosphere. This work first demonstrates that the formation of photoinduced •OH radical can directly promote the heterogeneous conversion of SO2 to H2SO4 on real diesel soot under light irradiation, extending the known sources of atmospheric H2SO4.",2022-09-12
217,Self-repairing interphase reconstructed in each cycle for highly reversible aqueous zinc batteries,"Aqueous zinc (Zn) chemistry features intrinsic safety, but suffers from severe irreversibility, as exemplified by low Coulombic efficiency, sustained water consumption and dendrite growth, which hampers practical applications of rechargeable Zn batteries. Herein, we report a highly reversible aqueous Zn battery in which the graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots additive serves as fast colloid ion carriers and assists the construction of a dynamic & self-repairing protective interphase. This real-time assembled interphase enables an ion-sieving effect and is found actively regenerate in each battery cycle, in effect endowing the system with single Zn2+ conduction and constant conformal integrality, executing timely adaption of Zn deposition, thus retaining sustainable long-term protective effect. In consequence, dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping at ~99.6% Coulombic efficiency for 200 cycles, steady charge-discharge for 1200 h, and impressive cyclability (61.2% retention for 500 cycles in a Zn | |MnO2 full battery, 73.2% retention for 500 cycles in a Zn | |V2O5 full battery and 93.5% retention for 3000 cycles in a Zn | |VOPO4 full battery) are achieved, which defines a general pathway to challenge Lithium in all low-cost, large-scale applications.","Metallic zinc is an ideal anode material for aqueous rechargeable batteries but reversibility is a challenge.

218,Genomic insights into rapid speciation within the world’s largest tree genus Syzygium,"Species radiations, despite immense phenotypic variation, can be difficult to resolve phylogenetically when genetic change poorly matches the rapidity of diversification. Genomic potential furnished by palaeopolyploidy, and relative roles for adaptation, random drift and hybridisation in the apportionment of genetic variation, remain poorly understood factors. Here, we study these aspects in a model radiation, Syzygium, the most species-rich tree genus worldwide. Genomes of 182 distinct species and 58 unidentified taxa are compared against a chromosome-level reference genome of the sea apple, Syzygium grande. We show that while Syzygium shares an ancient genome doubling event with other Myrtales, little evidence exists for recent polyploidy events. Phylogenomics confirms that Syzygium originated in Australia-New Guinea and diversified in multiple migrations, eastward to the Pacific and westward to India and Africa, in bursts of speciation visible as poorly resolved branches on phylogenies. Furthermore, some sublineages demonstrate genomic clines that recapitulate cladogenetic events, suggesting that stepwise geographic speciation, a neutral process, has been important in Syzygium diversification.","The relative importance of the mechanisms underlying species radiation remains unclear. Here, the authors combine reference genome assembly and population genetics analyses to show that neutral forces have contributed to the radiation of the most species-rich tree genus Syzygium.",2022-09-12
219,Polyvinyl chloride degradation by a bacterium isolated from the gut of insect larvae,"Evidence for microbial degradation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has previously been reported, but little is known about the degrading strains and enzymes. Here, we isolate a PVC-degrading bacterium from the gut of insect larvae and shed light on the PVC degradation pathway using a multi-omic approach. We show that the larvae of an insect pest, Spodoptera frugiperda, can survive by feeding on PVC film, and this is associated with enrichment of Enterococcus, Klebsiella and other bacteria in the larva’s gut microbiota. A bacterial strain isolated from the larval intestine (Klebsiella sp. EMBL-1) is able to depolymerize and utilize PVC as sole energy source. We use genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses to identify genes and proteins potentially involved in PVC degradation (e.g., catalase-peroxidase, dehalogenases, enolase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and oxygenase), and propose a PVC biodegradation pathway. Furthermore, enzymatic assays using the purified catalase-peroxidase support a role in PVC depolymerization.","Microbial degradation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has previously been reported, but little is known about the degrading strains and enzymes.

220,Elucidation of divergent desaturation pathways in the formation of vinyl isonitrile and isocyanoacrylate,"Two different types of desaturations are employed by iron- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (Fe/2OG) enzymes to construct vinyl isonitrile and isocyanoacrylate moieties found in isonitrile-containing natural products. A substrate-bound protein structure reveals a plausible strategy to affect desaturation and hints at substrate promiscuity of these enzymes. Analogs are synthesized and used as mechanistic probes to validate structural observations. Instead of proceeding through hydroxylated intermediate as previously proposed, a plausible carbocation species is utilized to trigger C=C bond installation. These Fe/2OG enzymes can also accommodate analogs with opposite chirality and different functional groups including isonitrile-(D)-tyrosine, N-formyl tyrosine, and phloretic acid, while maintaining the reaction selectivity.","While canonical oxygen-rebound pathway has been utilized by several Fe/2OG enzymes, insights into the desaturation process remain to be elucidated. Here, the authors suggest that a carbocation might be deployed to enable chemically divergent desaturations through decarboxylation and deprotonation.",2022-09-12
221,Heterologous vector versus homologous mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccination in non-seroconverted immunosuppressed patients: a randomized controlled trial,"Impaired response to COVID-19 vaccination is of particular concern in immunosuppressed patients. To determine the best vaccination strategy for this vulnerable group we performed a single center, 1:1 randomized blinded clinical trial. Patients who failed to seroconvert upon two mRNA vaccinations (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) are randomized to receive either a third dose of the same mRNA or the vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Primary endpoint is the difference in SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody seroconversion rate between vector and mRNA vaccinated patients four weeks after the third dose. Secondary outcomes include cellular immune responses. Seroconversion rates at week four are significantly higher in the mRNA (homologous vaccination, 15/24, 63%) as compared to the vector vaccine group (heterologous vaccination, 4/22, 18%). SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses are reduced but could be increased after a third dose of either vector or mRNA vaccine. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, patient age and vaccine type are associated with seroconversion. No serious adverse event is attributed to COVID-19 booster vaccination. Efficacy and safety data underline the importance of a booster vaccination and support the use of a homologous mRNA booster vaccination in immunosuppressed patients.Trial registration: EudraCT No.: 2021-002693-10.","Optimizing COVID-19 vaccination strategies for patients under immunosuppressive medication is of high importance.

222,Reactivating hippocampal-mediated memories during reconsolidation to disrupt fear,"Memories are stored in the brain as cellular ensembles activated during learning and reactivated during retrieval. Using the Tet-tag system in mice, we label dorsal dentate gyrus neurons activated by positive, neutral or negative experiences with channelrhodopsin-2. Following fear-conditioning, these cells are artificially reactivated during fear memory recall. Optical stimulation of a competing positive memory is sufficient to update the memory during reconsolidation, thereby reducing conditioned fear acutely and enduringly. Moreover, mice demonstrate operant responding for reactivation of a positive memory, confirming its rewarding properties. These results show that interference from a rewarding experience can counteract negative affective states. While memory-updating, induced by memory reactivation, involves a relatively small set of neurons, we also find that activating a large population of randomly labeled dorsal dentate gyrus neurons is effective in promoting reconsolidation. Importantly, memory-updating is specific to the fear memory. These findings implicate the dorsal dentate gyrus as a potential therapeutic node for modulating memories to suppress fear.","The hippocampus is a brain region critically involved in memory. In this study, the authors demonstrate that reactivating hippocampal neurons associated with positive memories can disrupt a fear response in mice.",2022-09-12
223,SREBP2-dependent lipid gene transcription enhances the infection of human dendritic cells by Zika virus,"The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) as a global health threat has highlighted the unmet need for ZIKV-specific vaccines and antiviral treatments. ZIKV infects dendritic cells (DC), which have pivotal functions in activating innate and adaptive antiviral responses; however, the mechanisms by which DC function is subverted to establish ZIKV infection are unclear. Here we develop a genomics profiling method that enables discrete analysis of ZIKV-infected versus neighboring, uninfected primary human DCs to increase the sensitivity and specificity with which ZIKV-modulated pathways can be identified. The results show that ZIKV infection specifically increases the expression of genes enriched for lipid metabolism-related functions. ZIKV infection also increases the recruitment of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors to lipid gene promoters, while pharmacologic inhibition or genetic silencing of SREBP2 suppresses ZIKV infection of DCs. Our data thus identify SREBP2-activated transcription as a mechanism for promoting ZIKV infection amenable to therapeutic targeting.","Zika virus (ZIKV) infection suppresses the induction of dendritic cell (DC)-derived immunity, but the underlying mechanistical insights are still lacking. Here the authors show, using in vitro systems profiling of DC transcriptome and epigenome, that ZIKV specifically alters SREBP2-related expression of inflammation- and metabolism-related genes to modulate DC functions.",2022-09-12
224,Life at high temperature observed in vitro upon laser heating of gold nanoparticles,"Thermophiles are microorganisms that thrive at high temperature. Studying them can provide valuable information on how life has adapted to extreme conditions. However, high temperature conditions are difficult to achieve on conventional optical microscopes. Some home-made solutions have been proposed, all based on local resistive electric heating, but no simple commercial solution exists. In this article, we introduce the concept of microscale laser heating over the field of view of a microscope to achieve high temperature for the study of thermophiles, while maintaining the user environment in soft conditions. Microscale heating with moderate laser intensities is achieved using a substrate covered with gold nanoparticles, as biocompatible, efficient light absorbers. The influences of possible microscale fluid convection, cell confinement and centrifugal thermophoretic motion are discussed. The method is demonstrated with two species: (i) Geobacillus stearothermophilus, a motile thermophilic bacterium thriving around 65 °C, which we observed to germinate, grow and swim upon microscale heating and (ii) Sulfolobus shibatae, a hyperthermophilic archaeon living at the optimal temperature of 80 °C. This work opens the path toward simple and safe observation of thermophilic microorganisms using current and accessible microscopy tools.","Studying microorganisms at high temperatures is challenging on conventional optical microscopes.

225,Record high-Tc and large practical utilization level of electric polarization in metal-free molecular antiferroelectric solid solutions,"Metal-free antiferroelectric materials are holding a promise for energy storage application, owing to their unique merits of wearability, environmental friendliness, and structure tunability. Despite receiving great interests, metal-free antiferroelectrics are quite limited and it is a challenge to acquire new soft antiferroelectric candidates. Here, we have successfully exploited binary CMBrxI1-x and CMBrxCl1-x solid solution as single crystals (0 ≤ x ≤ 1, where CM is cyclohexylmethylammonium). A molecule-level modification can effectively enhance Curie temperature. Emphatically, the binary CM-chloride salt shows the highest antiferroelectric-to-paraelectric Curie temperature of ~453 K among the known molecular antiferroelectrics. Its characteristic double electrical hysteresis loops provide a large electric polarization up to ~11.4 μC/cm2, which endows notable energy storage behaviors. To our best knowledge, this work provides an effective solid-solution methodology to the targeted design of new metal-free antiferroelectric candidates toward biocompatible energy storage devices.","Molecular ferroic materials receive considerable interest in view of field-induced switchable polar/magnetic orders.

226,"Identifying interpretable gene-biomarker associations with functionally informed kernel-based tests in 190,000 exomes","Here we present an exome-wide rare genetic variant association study for 30 blood biomarkers in 191,971 individuals in the UK Biobank. We compare gene-based association tests for separate functional variant categories to increase interpretability and identify 193 significant gene-biomarker associations. Genes associated with biomarkers were ~ 4.5-fold enriched for conferring Mendelian disorders. In addition to performing weighted gene-based variant collapsing tests, we design and apply variant-category-specific kernel-based tests that integrate quantitative functional variant effect predictions for missense variants, splicing and the binding of RNA-binding proteins. For these tests, we present a computationally efficient combination of the likelihood-ratio and score tests that found 36% more associations than the score test alone while also controlling the type-1 error. Kernel-based tests identified 13% more associations than their gene-based collapsing counterparts and had advantages in the presence of gain of function missense variants. We introduce local collapsing by amino acid position for missense variants and use it to interpret associations and identify potential novel gain of function variants in PIEZO1. Our results show the benefits of investigating different functional mechanisms when performing rare-variant association tests, and demonstrate pervasive rare-variant contribution to biomarker variability.","Genetic association studies for rare variants suffer from lack of power and thus there is a need for methods to improve rare variant discovery. Here, the authors present functionally informed association tests with increased statistical power to aid discovery and interpretation of rare variants.",2022-09-10
227,Triple ionization and fragmentation of benzene trimers following ultrafast intermolecular Coulombic decay,"Intermolecular interactions involving aromatic rings are ubiquitous in biochemistry and they govern the properties of many organic materials. Nevertheless, our understanding of the structures and dynamics of aromatic clusters remains incomplete, in particular for systems beyond the dimers, despite their high presence in many macromolecular systems such as DNA and proteins. Here, we study the fragmentation dynamics of benzene trimer that represents a prototype of higher-order aromatic clusters. The trimers are initially ionized by electron-collision with the creation of a deep-lying carbon 2s−1 state or one outer-valence and one inner-valence vacancies at two separate molecules. The system can thus relax via ultrafast intermolecular decay mechanisms, leading to the formation of C\({}_{6}{{{{{{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}}}}_{6}}^{+}\cdot\)C\({}_{6}{{{{{{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}}}}_{6}}^{+}\cdot\)C\({}_{6}{{{{{{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}}}}_{6}}^{+}\) trications and followed by a concerted three-body Coulomb explosion. Triple-coincidence ion momentum spectroscopy, accompanied by ab-initio calculations and further supported by strong-field laser experiments, allows us to elucidate the details on the fragmentation dynamics of benzene trimers.","Higher-order aromatic clusters are prevalent in biochemical systems, but a full understanding of their structural and dynamical properties is lacking. Here, the authors demonstrate that inner-valence ionization can induce ultrafast relaxation and further fragmentation mechanisms in benzene trimers.",2022-09-10
228,Unconventional interfacial water structure of highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes at negative electrode polarizations,"Water-in-salt electrolytes are an appealing option for future electrochemical energy storage devices due to their safety and low toxicity. However, the physicochemical interactions occurring at the interface between the electrode and the water-in-salt electrolyte are not yet fully understood. Here, via in situ Raman spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the electrical double-layer structure occurring at the interface between a water-in-salt electrolyte and an Au(111) electrode. We demonstrate that most interfacial water molecules are bound with lithium ions and have zero, one, or two hydrogen bonds to feature three hydroxyl stretching bands. Moreover, the accumulation of lithium ions on the electrode surface at large negative polarizations reduces the interfacial field to induce an unusual “hydrogen-up” structure of interfacial water and blue shift of the hydroxyl stretching frequencies. These physicochemical behaviours are quantitatively different from aqueous electrolyte solutions with lower concentrations. This atomistic understanding of the double-layer structure provides key insights for designing future aqueous electrolytes for electrochemical energy storage devices.","Water-in-salt electrolytes can be useful for future electrochemical energy storage systems. Here, the authors investigate the potential-dependent double-layer structures at the interface between a gold electrode and a highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte solution via in situ Raman measurements.",2022-09-10
229,The primeval optical evolving matter by optical binding inside and outside the photon beam,"Optical binding has recently gained considerable attention because it enables the light-induced assembly of many-body systems; however, this phenomenon has only been described between directly irradiated particles. Here, we demonstrate that optical binding can occur outside the focal spot of a single tightly focused laser beam. By trapping at an interface, we assemble up to three gold nanoparticles with a linear arrangement which fully-occupies the laser focus. The trapping laser is efficiently scattered by this linear alignment and interacts with particles outside the focus area, generating several discrete arc-shape potential wells with a half-wavelength periodicity. Those external nanoparticles inside the arcs show a correlated motion not only with the linear aligned particles, but also between themselves even both are not directly illuminated. We propose that the particles are optically bound outside the focal spot by the back-scattered light and multi-channel light scattering, forming a dynamic optical binding network.","Optical binding enables light-induced assembly of many particles within a focus area. Here, the authors demonstrate that optical binding can occur outside the irradiated area by scattered light interacting with the particles outside the focus, generating arc-shape potential wells for particle trapping.",2022-09-10
230,A multi-state dynamic process confers mechano-adaptation to a biological nanomachine,"Adaptation is a defining feature of living systems. The bacterial flagellar motor adapts to changes in the external mechanical load by adding or removing torque-generating (stator) units. But the molecular mechanism behind this mechano-adaptation remains unclear. Here, we combine single motor eletrorotation experiments and theoretical modeling to show that mechano-adaptation of the flagellar motor is enabled by multiple mechanosensitive internal states. Dwell time statistics from experiments suggest the existence of at least two bound states with a high and a low unbinding rate, respectively. A first-passage-time analysis of a four-state model quantitatively explains the experimental data and determines the transition rates among all four states. The torque generated by bound stator units controls their effective unbinding rate by modulating the transition between the bound states, possibly via a catch bond mechanism. Similar force-mediated feedback enabled by multiple internal states may apply to adaptation in other macromolecular complexes.","Combining experiments with modeling, Wadhwa et al. propose a model for mechano-adaptation in the bacterial flagellar motor, finding that load-dependent transitions between multiple internal states govern the binding and unbinding of subunits.",2022-09-10
231,Functional genomics uncovers the transcription factor BNC2 as required for myofibroblastic activation in fibrosis,"Tissue injury triggers activation of mesenchymal lineage cells into wound-repairing myofibroblasts, whose unrestrained activity leads to fibrosis. Although this process is largely controlled at the transcriptional level, whether the main transcription factors involved have all been identified has remained elusive. Here, we report multi-omics analyses unraveling Basonuclin 2 (BNC2) as a myofibroblast identity transcription factor. Using liver fibrosis as a model for in-depth investigations, we first show that BNC2 expression is induced in both mouse and human fibrotic livers from different etiologies and decreases upon human liver fibrosis regression. Importantly, we found that BNC2 transcriptional induction is a specific feature of myofibroblastic activation in fibrotic tissues. Mechanistically, BNC2 expression and activities allow to integrate pro-fibrotic stimuli, including TGFβ and Hippo/YAP1 signaling, towards induction of matrisome genes such as those encoding type I collagen. As a consequence, Bnc2 deficiency blunts collagen deposition in livers of mice fed a fibrogenic diet. Additionally, our work establishes BNC2 as potentially druggable since we identified the thalidomide derivative CC-885 as a BNC2 inhibitor. Altogether, we propose that BNC2 is a transcription factor involved in canonical pathways driving myofibroblastic activation in fibrosis.","Myofibroblasts contribute to the development of liver fibrosis. Here, the authors report that the transcription factor Basonuclin 2 (BNC2) integrates fibrogenic signals and drives myofibroblastic transcriptional activation in liver fibrosis.",2022-09-10
232,Identifying and tailoring C–N coupling site for efficient urea synthesis over diatomic Fe–Ni catalyst,"Electrocatalytic urea synthesis emerged as the promising alternative of Haber–Bosch process and industrial urea synthetic protocol. Here, we report that a diatomic catalyst with bonded Fe–Ni pairs can significantly improve the efficiency of electrochemical urea synthesis. Compared with isolated diatomic and single-atom catalysts, the bonded Fe–Ni pairs act as the efficient sites for coordinated adsorption and activation of multiple reactants, enhancing the crucial C–N coupling thermodynamically and kinetically. The performance for urea synthesis up to an order of magnitude higher than those of single-atom and isolated diatomic electrocatalysts, a high urea yield rate of 20.2 mmol h−1 g−1 with corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 17.8% has been successfully achieved. A total Faradaic efficiency of about 100% for the formation of value-added urea, CO, and NH3 was realized. This work presents an insight into synergistic catalysis towards sustainable urea synthesis via identifying and tailoring the atomic site configurations.",The direct electrocatalytic synthesis of urea via C–N coupling is of great significance. The authors report a diatomic catalyst with bonded Fe–Ni pairs to improve the efficiency of electrochemical urea synthesis from nitrate and CO2.,2022-09-10
233,Therapeutic high affinity T cell receptor targeting a KRASG12D cancer neoantigen,"Neoantigens derived from somatic mutations are specific to cancer cells and are ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy. KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene and drives the pathogenesis of several cancers. Here we show the identification and development of an affinity-enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes a peptide derived from the most common KRAS mutant, KRASG12D, presented in the context of HLA-A*11:01. The affinity of the engineered TCR is increased by over one million-fold yet fully able to distinguish KRASG12D over KRASWT. While crystal structures reveal few discernible differences in TCR interactions with KRASWT versus KRASG12D, thermodynamic analysis and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that TCR specificity is driven by differences in indirect electrostatic interactions. The affinity enhanced TCR, fused to a humanized anti-CD3 scFv, enables selective killing of cancer cells expressing KRASG12D. Our work thus reveals a molecular mechanism that drives TCR selectivity and describes a soluble bispecific molecule with therapeutic potential against cancers harboring a common shared neoantigen.","Cancers often harbor mutations in genes encoding important regulatory proteins, but therapeutic targeting of these molecules proves difficult due to their high structural similarity to their non-mutated counterpart. Here authors show the engineering of T cell engaging bispecific protein able to selectively target cancer cells with a high-frequency mutation in the KRAS oncogene.",2022-09-10
234,Enzymes and cellular interplay required for flux of fixed nitrogen to ureides in bean nodules,"Tropical legumes transport fixed nitrogen in form of ureides (allantoin and allantoate) over long distances from the nodules to the shoot. Ureides are formed in nodules from purine mononucleotides by a partially unknown reaction network that involves bacteroid-infected and uninfected cells. Here, we demonstrate by metabolic analysis of CRISPR mutant nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris defective in either xanthosine monophosphate phosphatase (XMPP), guanosine deaminase (GSDA), the nucleoside hydrolases 1 and 2 (NSH1, NSH2) or xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) that nodule ureide biosynthesis involves these enzymes and requires xanthosine and guanosine but not inosine monophosphate catabolism. Interestingly, promoter reporter analyses revealed that XMPP, GSDA and XDH are expressed in infected cells, whereas NSH1, NSH2 and the promoters of the downstream enzymes urate oxidase (UOX) and allantoinase (ALN) are active in uninfected cells. The data suggest a complex cellular organization of ureide biosynthesis with three transitions between infected and uninfected cells.","Tropical legumes export fixed nitrogen from nodules as ureides. Here, the authors describe how ureides are produced by several biosynthetic enzymes in different nodule cell types and provide explanations for metabolic compartmentation.",2022-09-10
235,Genome-scale RNA interference profiling of Trypanosoma brucei cell cycle progression defects,"Trypanosomatids, which include major pathogens of humans and livestock, are flagellated protozoa for which cell cycle controls and the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we describe a genome-wide RNA-interference library screen for cell cycle defects in Trypanosoma brucei. We induced massive parallel knockdown, sorted the perturbed population using high-throughput flow cytometry, deep-sequenced RNAi-targets from each stage and digitally reconstructed cell cycle profiles at a genomic scale; also enabling data visualisation using an online tool (https://tryp-cycle.pages.dev/). Analysis of several hundred genes that impact cell cycle progression reveals >100 flagellar component knockdowns linked to genome endoreduplication, evidence for metabolic control of the G1-S transition, surface antigen regulatory mRNA-binding protein knockdowns linked to G2M accumulation, and a putative nucleoredoxin required for both mitochondrial genome segregation and for mitosis. The outputs provide comprehensive functional genomic evidence for the known and novel machineries, pathways and regulators that coordinate trypanosome cell cycle progression.","Progression of the canonical eukaryotic cell cycle is tightly regulated. While the cell cycle control of flagellated protozoa Trypanosoma brucei shares conserved features with other eukaryotes certain cell cycle checkpoints are absent. Here, Marques et al. provide a genome-scale RNAi screen followed by sorting of parasites according to their cell cycle stage to inform about cell cycle regulators of bloodstream T. brucei.",2022-09-10
236,Chang’E-5 samples reveal high water content in lunar minerals,"The formation and distribution of lunar surficial water remains ambiguous. Here, we show the prominence of water (OH/H2O) attributed to solar wind implantation on the uppermost surface of olivine, plagioclase, and pyroxene grains from Chang’E-5 samples. The results of spectral and microstructural analyses indicate that solar wind-derived water is affected by exposure time, crystal structure, and mineral composition. Our estimate of a minimum of 170 ppm water content in lunar soils in the Chang’E-5 region is consistent with that reported by the Moon Minerology Mapper and Chang’E-5 lander. By comparing with remote sensing data and through lunar soil maturity analysis, the amount of water in Chang’E-5 provides a reference for the distribution of surficial water in middle latitude of the Moon. We conclude that minerals in lunar soils are important reservoirs of water, and formation and retention of water originating from solar wind occurs on airless bodies.",Lunar soils returned by China’s Chang’E−5 (CE5) mission record the unique information of solar wind essential to understanding the preservation and distribution of lunar surficial water. Here the authors report abundant water formed by solar wind implantation in minerals of CE5 lunar soils; the water content in CE5 lunar soils is estimated to be ~ 170 ppm.,2022-09-10
237,Wilkes subglacial basin ice sheet response to Southern Ocean warming during late Pleistocene interglacials,"The response of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet to past intervals of oceanic and atmospheric warming is still not well constrained but is critical for understanding both past and future sea-level change. Furthermore, the ice sheet in the Wilkes Subglacial Basin appears to have undergone thinning and ice discharge events during recent decades. Here we combine glaciological evidence on ice sheet elevation from the TALDICE ice core with offshore sedimentological records and ice sheet modelling experiments to reconstruct the ice dynamics in the Wilkes Subglacial Basin over the past 350,000 years. Our results indicate that the Wilkes Subglacial Basin experienced an extensive retreat 330,000 years ago and a more limited retreat 125,000 years ago. These changes coincide with warmer Southern Ocean temperatures and elevated global mean sea level during those interglacial periods, confirming the sensitivity of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin ice sheet to ocean warming and its potential role in sea-level change.","Crotti et al. reconstructed the dynamics of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin (Antarctica) during the past 350,000 years. Their study reveals that a portion of the East Antarctic ice sheet experienced an extensive retreat 330,000 years ago.",2022-09-10
238,Holocene seasonal temperature evolution and spatial variability over the Northern Hemisphere landmass,"The origin of the temperature divergence between Holocene proxy reconstructions and model simulations remains controversial, but it possibly results from potential biases in the seasonality of reconstructions or in the climate sensitivity of models. Here we present an extensive dataset of Holocene seasonal temperatures reconstructed using 1310 pollen records covering the Northern Hemisphere landmass. Our results indicate that both summer and winter temperatures warmed from the early to mid-Holocene (~11–7 ka BP) and then cooled thereafter, but with significant spatial variability. Strong early Holocene warming trend occurred mainly in Europe, eastern North America and northern Asia, which can be generally captured by model simulations and is likely associated with the retreat of continental ice sheets. The subsequent cooling trend is pervasively recorded except for northern Asia and southeastern North America, which may reflect the cross-seasonal impact of the decreasing summer insolation through climatic feedbacks, but the cooling in winter season is not well reproduced by climate models. Our results challenge the proposal that seasonal biases in proxies are the main origin of model–data discrepancies and highlight the critical impact of insolation and associated feedbacks on temperature changes, which warrant closer attention in future climate modelling.","The study reconstructed Holocene seasonal temperatures using 1,310 pollen records covering the Northern Hemisphere landmass, and show that both summer and winter temperatures peaked at ~7 ka BP, but with significant spatial variability.",2022-09-10
239,Anomalous transverse resistance in the topological superconductor β-Bi2Pd,"A supercurrent flowing in a superconductor meets no resistance. Yet an electric field may still be established within the superconductor in the presence of dissipative processes, such as vortex motion. Here we report the observation of a transverse voltage drop in superconducting β-Bi2Pd thin films. Unlike the Hall effect in general or in other superconductors, the sign of the observed transverse voltage does not depend on the external magnetic field. Instead, it is dictated by the broken inversion symmetry on the film interfaces. This anomalous transverse voltage, or transverse resistance, is indicative of a chirality that likely resonates with the topological surface states reported in β-Bi2Pd.","Centrosymmetric β-Bi2Pd is a candidate topological superconductor. Here, the authors observe a transverse voltage in β-Bi2Pd thin films and propose that this voltage is a result of chiral topological surface states.",2022-09-09
240,Mitigation of China’s carbon neutrality to global warming,"Projecting mitigations of carbon neutrality from individual countries in relation to future global warming is of great importance for depicting national climate responsibility but is poorly quantified. Here, we show that China’s carbon neutrality (CNCN) can individually mitigate global warming by 0.48 °C and 0.40 °C, which account for 14% and 9% of the global warming over the long term under the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 3-7.0 and 5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. Further incorporating changes in CH4 and N2O emissions in association with CNCN together will alleviate global warming by 0.21 °C and 0.32 °C for SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 over the long term, and even by 0.18 °C for SSP2-4.5 over the mid-term, but no significant impacts are shown for all SSPs in the near term. Divergent responses in alleviated warming are seen at regional scales. The results provide a useful reference for the global stocktake, which assesses the collective progress towards the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.","Here the authors show that China’s carbon neutrality may mitigate global warming by 0.48 °C and 0.40 °C, which account for 14% and 9% of the global warming over the long term under the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 3-7.0 and 5-8.5 scenarios, respectively.",2022-09-09
241,CtIP-dependent nascent RNA expression flanking DNA breaks guides the choice of DNA repair pathway,"The RNA world is changing our views about sensing and resolution of DNA damage. Here, we develop single-molecule DNA/RNA analysis approaches to visualize how nascent RNA facilitates the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is crucial for DSB resolution in human cells. DSB-flanking, RNAPII-generated nascent RNA forms RNA:DNA hybrids, guiding the upstream DNA repair steps towards favouring the error-free Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway over Non-Homologous End Joining. Specific RNAPII inhibitor, THZ1, impairs recruitment of essential HR proteins to DSBs, implicating nascent RNA in DNA end resection, initiation and execution of HR repair. We further propose that resection factor CtIP interacts with and helps re-activate RNAPII when paused by the RNA:DNA hybrids, collectively promoting faithful repair of chromosome breaks to maintain genomic integrity.","RNA has been implicated in DNA repair. This work shows that the interplay of RNAPII-generated nascent RNA, RNA:DNA hybrids and the resection factor CtIP guide DNA double strand break repair pathway choice towards error-free homologous recombination.",2022-09-09
242,Enhanced detection of threat materials by dark-field x-ray imaging combined with deep neural networks,"X-ray imaging has been boosted by the introduction of phase-based methods. Detail visibility is enhanced in phase contrast images, and dark-field images are sensitive to inhomogeneities on a length scale below the system’s spatial resolution. Here we show that dark-field creates a texture which is characteristic of the imaged material, and that its combination with conventional attenuation leads to an improved discrimination of threat materials. We show that remaining ambiguities can be resolved by exploiting the different energy dependence of the dark-field and attenuation signals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the dark-field texture is well-suited for identification through machine learning approaches through two proof-of-concept studies. In both cases, application of the same approaches to datasets from which the dark-field images were removed led to a clear degradation in performance. While the small scale of these studies means further research is required, results indicate potential for a combined use of dark-field and deep neural networks in security applications and beyond.","Dark-field X-ray imaging is sensitive to the microstructure of a material. Here, the authors combine this with a neural network algorithm to provide efficient material discrimination, e.g., of explosives vs non-threat materials.",2022-09-09
243,Inhibition of the Niemann-Pick C1 protein is a conserved feature of multiple strains of pathogenic mycobacteria,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) survives and replicates within host macrophages (MΦ) and subverts multiple antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Previously, we reported that lipids shed by pathogenic mycobacteria inhibit NPC1, the lysosomal membrane protein deficient in the lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). Inhibition of NPC1 leads to a drop in lysosomal calcium levels, blocking phagosome-lysosome fusion leading to mycobacterial survival. We speculated that the production of specific cell wall lipid(s) that inhibit NPC1 could have been a critical step in the evolution of pathogenicity. We therefore investigated whether lipid extracts from clinical Mtb strains from multiple Mtb lineages, Mtb complex (MTBC) members and non-tubercular mycobacteria (NTM) inhibit the NPC pathway. We report that inhibition of the NPC pathway was present in all clinical isolates from Mtb lineages 1, 2, 3 and 4, Mycobacterium bovis and the NTM, Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium. However, lipid extract from Mycobacterium canettii, which is considered to resemble the common ancestor of the MTBC did not inhibit the NPC1 pathway. We conclude that the evolution of NPC1 inhibitory mycobacterial cell wall lipids evolved early and post divergence from Mycobacterium canettii-related mycobacteria and that this activity contributes significantly to the promotion of disease.","Lipids shed by pathogenic mycobacteria have been shown to inhibit NPC1, a lysosomal membrane protein deficient in most cases of a rate inherited lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). Here, authors utilise lipid extracts from clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, and non-tubercular mycobacteria to investigate their ability to inhibit the NPC pathway.",2022-09-09
244,Biofeedback electrostimulation for bionic and long-lasting neural modulation,"Invasive electrical stimulation (iES) is prone to cause neural stimulus-inertia owing to its excessive accumulation of exogenous charges, thereby resulting in many side effects and even failure of nerve regeneration and functional recovery. Here, a wearable neural iES system is well designed and built for bionic and long-lasting neural modulation. It can automatically yield biomimetic pulsed electrical signals under the driven of respiratory motion. These electrical signals are full of unique physiological synchronization can give biofeedback to respiratory behaviors, self-adjusting with different physiological states of the living body, and thus realizing a dynamic and biological self-matched modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels on the cell membrane. Abundant cellular and animal experimental evidence confirm an effective elimination of neural stimulus-inertia by these bioelectrical signals. An unprecedented nerve regeneration and motor functional reconstruction are achieved in long-segmental peripheral nerve defects, which is equal to the gold standard of nerve repair -- autograft. The wearable neural iES system provides an advanced platform to overcome the common neural stimulus-inertia and gives a broad avenue for personalized iES therapy of nerve injury and neurodegenerative diseases.","Designing wereable neural invasive electrical stimulation system remains a challenge. Here, researchers provide an effective technology platform for the elimination of tricky neural stimulus-inertia using bionic electronic modulation, which is a significant step forward for long-lasting treatment of nervous system diseases.",2022-09-09
245,Targeted immunotherapy against distinct cancer-associated fibroblasts overcomes treatment resistance in refractory HER2+ breast tumors,"About 50% of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ breast cancer patients do not benefit from HER2-targeted therapy and almost 20% of them relapse after treatment. Here, we conduct a detailed analysis of two independent cohorts of HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance to anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies. In addition, we develop a fully humanized immunocompetent model of HER2+ breast cancer recapitulating ex vivo the biological processes that associate with patients’ response to treatment. Thanks to these two approaches, we uncover a population of TGF-beta-activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) specific from tumors resistant to therapy. The presence of this cellular subset related to previously described myofibroblastic (CAF-S1) and podoplanin+ CAF subtypes in breast cancer associates with low IL2 activity. Correspondingly, we find that stroma-targeted stimulation of IL2 pathway in unresponsive tumors restores trastuzumab anti-cancer efficiency. Overall, our study underscores the therapeutic potential of exploiting the tumor microenvironment to identify and overcome mechanisms of resistance to anti-cancer treatment.","A substantial proportion of HER2+ breast cancer patients do not benefit from HER2-targeted therapy. Here, the authors identify a population of cancer-associated fibroblasts involved in the suppression of trastuzumab-induced ADCC that can be pharmacologically targeted to raise treatment effectiveness in unresponsive tumors.",2022-09-09
246,Lagging strand gap suppression connects BRCA-mediated fork protection to nucleosome assembly through PCNA-dependent CAF-1 recycling,"The inability to protect stalled replication forks from nucleolytic degradation drives genome instability and underlies chemosensitivity in BRCA-deficient tumors. An emerging hallmark of BRCA-deficiency is the inability to suppress replication-associated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps. Here, we report that lagging strand ssDNA gaps interfere with the ASF1-CAF-1 nucleosome assembly pathway, and drive fork degradation in BRCA-deficient cells. We show that CAF-1 function at replication forks is lost in BRCA-deficient cells, due to defects in its recycling during replication stress. This CAF-1 recycling defect is caused by lagging strand gaps which preclude PCNA unloading, causing sequestration of PCNA-CAF-1 complexes on chromatin. Importantly, correcting PCNA unloading defects in BRCA-deficient cells restores CAF-1-dependent fork stability. We further show that the activation of a HIRA-dependent compensatory histone deposition pathway restores fork stability to BRCA-deficient cells. We thus define lagging strand gap suppression and nucleosome assembly as critical enablers of BRCA-mediated fork stability.","Efficient DNA replication is crucial for genome stability. Here, Thakar et al. report that accumulation of lagging strand ssDNA gaps during replication interferes with nucleosome assembly and drives replication fork degradation in BRCA-deficient cells.",2022-09-09
247,Everlasting impact of initial perturbations on first-passage times of non-Markovian random walks,"Persistence, defined as the probability that a signal has not reached a threshold up to a given observation time, plays a crucial role in the theory of random processes. Often, persistence decays algebraically with time with non trivial exponents. However, general analytical methods to calculate persistence exponents cannot be applied to the ubiquitous case of non-Markovian systems relaxing transiently after an imposed initial perturbation. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that enables the non-perturbative determination of persistence exponents of Gaussian non-Markovian processes with non stationary dynamics relaxing to a steady state after an initial perturbation. Two situations are analyzed: either the system is subjected to a temperature quench at initial time, or its past trajectory is assumed to have been observed and thus known. Our theory covers the case of spatial dimension higher than one, opening the way to characterize non-trivial reaction kinetics for complex systems with non-equilibrium initial conditions.","The persistence of random walker can quantify the kinetics of transport limited reactions and predict the time to reach a target, but is challenging for non-stationary random processes with a large number of degrees of freedom. The authors introduce a method to determine the persistence exponent of random processes with general non-stationary dynamics.",2022-09-09
248,Integrating and formatting biomedical data as pre-calculated knowledge graph embeddings in the Bioteque,"Biomedical data is accumulating at a fast pace and integrating it into a unified framework is a major challenge, so that multiple views of a given biological event can be considered simultaneously. Here we present the Bioteque, a resource of unprecedented size and scope that contains pre-calculated biomedical descriptors derived from a gigantic knowledge graph, displaying more than 450 thousand biological entities and 30 million relationships between them. The Bioteque integrates, harmonizes, and formats data collected from over 150 data sources, including 12 biological entities (e.g., genes, diseases, drugs) linked by 67 types of associations (e.g., ‘drug treats disease’, ‘gene interacts with gene’). We show how Bioteque descriptors facilitate the assessment of high-throughput protein-protein interactome data, the prediction of drug response and new repurposing opportunities, and demonstrate that they can be used off-the-shelf in downstream machine learning tasks without loss of performance with respect to using original data. The Bioteque thus offers a thoroughly processed, tractable, and highly optimized assembly of the biomedical knowledge available in the public domain.","Biomedical data is accumulating at a fast pace and integrating it into a unified framework is a major challenge. Here, the authors present a resource that contains pre-calculated biomedical descriptors derived from a very large knowledge graph.",2022-09-09
249,Quantum nonlinear spectroscopy of single nuclear spins,"Conventional nonlinear spectroscopy, which use classical probes, can only access a limited set of correlations in a quantum system. Here we demonstrate that quantum nonlinear spectroscopy, in which a quantum sensor and a quantum object are first entangled and the sensor is measured along a chosen basis, can extract arbitrary types and orders of correlations in a quantum system. We measured fourth-order correlations of single nuclear spins that cannot be measured in conventional nonlinear spectroscopy, using sequential weak measurement via a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. The quantum nonlinear spectroscopy provides fingerprint features to identify different types of objects, such as Gaussian noises, random-phased AC fields, and quantum spins, which would be indistinguishable in second-order correlations. This work constitutes an initial step toward the application of higher-order correlations to quantum sensing, to examining the quantum foundation (by, e.g., higher-order Leggett-Garg inequality), and to studying quantum many-body physics.","Signals that look the same from their low-order correlations can often be distinguished by looking at higher-order ones. Here, the authors exploit the sensitivity of quantum nonlinear spectroscopy to fourth-order correlations to identify Gaussian noises, random-phased AC fields, and quantum spins.",2022-09-09
250,Topographic design in wearable MXene sensors with in-sensor machine learning for full-body avatar reconstruction,"Wearable strain sensors that detect joint/muscle strain changes become prevalent at human–machine interfaces for full-body motion monitoring. However, most wearable devices cannot offer customizable opportunities to match the sensor characteristics with specific deformation ranges of joints/muscles, resulting in suboptimal performance. Adequate wearable strain sensor design is highly required to achieve user-designated working windows without sacrificing high sensitivity, accompanied with real-time data processing. Herein, wearable Ti3C2Tx MXene sensor modules are fabricated with in-sensor machine learning (ML) models, either functioning via wireless streaming or edge computing, for full-body motion classifications and avatar reconstruction. Through topographic design on piezoresistive nanolayers, the wearable strain sensor modules exhibited ultrahigh sensitivities within the working windows that meet all joint deformation ranges. By integrating the wearable sensors with a ML chip, an edge sensor module is fabricated, enabling in-sensor reconstruction of high-precision avatar animations that mimic continuous full-body motions with an average avatar determination error of 3.5 cm, without additional computing devices.","Wearable sensors with edge computing are desired for human motion monitoring. Here, the authors demonstrate a topographic design for wearable MXene sensor modules with wireless streaming or in-sensor computing models for avatar reconstruction.",2022-09-09
251,In vivo tumor immune microenvironment phenotypes correlate with inflammation and vasculature to predict immunotherapy response,"Response to immunotherapies can be variable and unpredictable. Pathology-based phenotyping of tumors into ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ is static, relying solely on T-cell infiltration in single-time single-site biopsies, resulting in suboptimal treatment response prediction. Dynamic vascular events (tumor angiogenesis, leukocyte trafficking) within tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) also influence anti-tumor immunity and treatment response. Here, we report dynamic cellular-level TiME phenotyping in vivo that combines inflammation profiles with vascular features through non-invasive reflectance confocal microscopic imaging. In skin cancer patients, we demonstrate three main TiME phenotypes that correlate with gene and protein expression, and response to toll-like receptor agonist immune-therapy. Notably, phenotypes with high inflammation associate with immunostimulatory signatures and those with high vasculature with angiogenic and endothelial anergy signatures. Moreover, phenotypes with high inflammation and low vasculature demonstrate the best treatment response. This non-invasive in vivo phenotyping approach integrating dynamic vasculature with inflammation serves as a reliable predictor of response to topical immune-therapy in patients.","Standard assessment of immune infiltration of biopsies is not sufficient to accurately predict response to immunotherapy. Here, the authors show that reflectance confocal microscopy can be used to quantify dynamic vasculature and inflammatory features to better predict treatment response in skin cancers.",2022-09-09
252,Chemical deposition of Cu2O films with ultra-low resistivity: correlation with the defect landscape,"Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is a promising p-type semiconductor material for many applications. So far, the lowest resistivity values are obtained for films deposited by physical methods and/or at high temperatures (~1000 °C), limiting their mass integration. Here, Cu2O thin films with ultra-low resistivity values of 0.4 Ω.cm were deposited at only 260 °C by atmospheric pressure spatial atomic layer deposition, a scalable chemical approach. The carrier concentration (7.1014−2.1018 cm−3), mobility (1–86 cm2/V.s), and optical bandgap (2.2–2.48 eV) are easily tuned by adjusting the fraction of oxygen used during deposition. The properties of the films are correlated to the defect landscape, as revealed by a combination of techniques (positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS), Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence). Our results reveal the existence of large complex defects and the decrease of the overall defect concentration in the films with increasing oxygen fraction used during deposition.","Cu2O offers a lot of potential for several optoelectronic applications. Here, the authors present a low temperature, fast and scalable approach to deposit Cu2O films with low resistivity, which is correlated to the defect landscape in the material.",2022-09-09
253,Spanning Fermi arcs in a two-dimensional magnet,"The discovery of topological states of matter has led to a revolution in materials research. When external or intrinsic parameters break symmetries, global properties of topological materials change drastically. A paramount example is the emergence of Weyl nodes under broken inversion symmetry. While a rich variety of non-trivial quantum phases could in principle also originate from broken time-reversal symmetry, realizing systems that combine magnetism with complex topological properties is remarkably elusive. Here, we demonstrate that giant open Fermi arcs are created at the surface of ultrathin hybrid magnets where the Fermi-surface topology is substantially modified by hybridization with a heavy-metal substrate. The interplay between magnetism and topology allows us to control the shape and the location of the Fermi arcs by tuning the magnetization direction. The hybridization points in the Fermi surface can be attributed to a non-trivial mixed topology and induce hot-spots in the Berry curvature, dominating spin and charge transport as well as magneto-electric coupling effects.","It has been predicted that elemental Iron, with low dimensionality, will be a topological metal hosting Weyl nodes. Here, Chen et al. grow iron on tungsten, a heavy metal with a strong spin-orbit interaction, and using momentum microscopy, show the emergence of giant open Fermi arcs which can be shaped by varying the magnetization of the iron.",2022-09-09
254,Grave-to-cradle upcycling of Ni from electroplating wastewater to photothermal CO2 catalysis,"Treating hazardous waste Ni from the electroplating industry is mandated world-wide, is exceptionally expensive, and carries a very high CO2 footprint. Rather than regarding Ni as a disposable waste, the chemicals and petrochemicals industries could instead consider it a huge resource. In the work described herein, we present a strategy for upcycling waste Ni from electroplating wastewater into a photothermal catalyst for converting CO2 to CO. Specifically, magnetic nanoparticles encapsulated in amine functionalized porous SiO2, is demonstrated to efficiently scavenge Ni from electroplating wastewater for utilization in photothermal CO2 catalysis. The core-shell catalyst architecture produces CO at a rate of 1.9 mol·gNi−1·h−1 (44.1 mmol·gcat−1·h−1), a selectivity close to 100%, and notable long-term stability. This strategy of upcycling metal waste into functional, catalytic materials offers a multi-pronged approach for clean and renewable energy technologies.","The valorization of undesirable substrates offers a two-fold strategy for pollution remediation and renewable energy conversion. Here, authors demonstrate the scavenging of Ni from electroplating wastewater and subsequent utilization as materials for photothermal CO2 reduction.",2022-09-09
255,Global energy spectrum of the general oceanic circulation,"Advent of satellite altimetry brought into focus the pervasiveness of mesoscale eddies \({{{{{{{\bf{{{{{{{{\mathcal{O}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}({100})\) km in size, which are the ocean’s analogue of weather systems and are often regarded as the spectral peak of kinetic energy (KE). Yet, understanding of the ocean’s spatial scales has been derived mostly from Fourier analysis in small ""representative” regions that cannot capture the vast dynamic range at planetary scales. Here, we use a coarse-graining method to analyze scales much larger than what had been possible before. Spectra spanning over three decades of length-scales reveal the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as the spectral peak of the global extra-tropical circulation, at ≈ 104 km, and a previously unobserved power-law scaling over scales larger than 103 km. A smaller spectral peak exists at ≈ 300 km associated with mesoscales, which, due to their wider spread in wavenumber space, account for more than 50% of resolved surface KE globally. Seasonal cycles of length-scales exhibit a characteristic lag-time of ≈ 40 days per octave of length-scales such that in both hemispheres, KE at 102 km peaks in spring while KE at 103 km peaks in late summer. These results provide a new window for understanding the multiscale oceanic circulation within Earth’s climate system, including the largest planetary scales.","Ocean spatial scale analysis has struggled to capture the vast dynamic range at planetary scales. Here the authors employ a method to probe circulation patterns in the World Ocean, thus opening a promising new window for measuring and understanding the ocean’s role in Earth’s climate system.",2022-09-09
256,Structure and function of H+/K+ pump mutants reveal Na+/K+ pump mechanisms,"Ion-transport mechanisms evolve by changing ion-selectivity, such as switching from Na+ to H+ selectivity in secondary-active transporters or P-type-ATPases. Here we study primary-active transport via P-type ATPases using functional and structural analyses to demonstrate that four simultaneous residue substitutions transform the non-gastric H+/K+ pump, a strict H+-dependent electroneutral P-type ATPase, into a bona fide Na+-dependent electrogenic Na+/K+ pump. Conversion of a H+-dependent primary-active transporter into a Na+-dependent one provides a prototype for similar studies of ion-transport proteins. Moreover, we solve the structures of the wild-type non-gastric H+/K+ pump, a suitable drug target to treat cystic fibrosis, and of its Na+/K+ pump-mimicking mutant in two major conformations, providing insight on how Na+ binding drives a concerted mechanism leading to Na+/K+ pump phosphorylation.","Here, the authors study ion transport mechanisms by introducing mutations to convert an electroneutral proton/potassium pump into a prototypical electrogenic sodium/potassium pump, explaining their selectivity and phosphorylation mechanisms.",2022-09-09
257,Traject3d allows label-free identification of distinct co-occurring phenotypes within 3D culture by live imaging,"Single cell profiling by genetic, proteomic and imaging methods has expanded the ability to identify programmes regulating distinct cell states. The 3-dimensional (3D) culture of cells or tissue fragments provides a system to study how such states contribute to multicellular morphogenesis. Whether cells plated into 3D cultures give rise to a singular phenotype or whether multiple biologically distinct phenotypes arise in parallel is largely unknown due to a lack of tools to detect such heterogeneity. Here we develop Traject3d (Trajectory identification in 3D), a method for identifying heterogeneous states in 3D culture and how these give rise to distinct phenotypes over time, from label-free multi-day time-lapse imaging. We use this to characterise the temporal landscape of morphological states of cancer cell lines, varying in metastatic potential and drug resistance, and use this information to identify drug combinations that inhibit such heterogeneity. Traject3d is therefore an important companion to other single-cell technologies by facilitating real-time identification via live imaging of how distinct states can lead to alternate phenotypes that occur in parallel in 3D culture.",There are currently a lack of tools to detect heterogeneity in 3D cultures. Here the authors report Traject3d as a framework to identify heterogeneous states in 3D culture and to understand how these give rise to distinct phenotypes using label-free multi-day time-lapse imaging.,2022-09-09
258,CAR-T cell therapy-related cytokine release syndrome and therapeutic response is modulated by the gut microbiome in hematologic malignancies,"Immunotherapy utilizing chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy holds promise for hematologic malignancies, however, response rates and associated immune-related adverse effects widely vary among patients. Here we show, by comparing diversity and composition of the gut microbiome during different CAR-T therapeutic phases in the clinical trial ChiCTR1800017404, that the gut flora characteristically differs among patients and according to treatment stages, and might also reflect patient response to therapy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM; n = 43), acute lympholastic leukemia (ALL; n = 23) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; n = 12). We observe significant temporal differences in diversity and abundance of Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, Sutterella, and Collinsella between MM patients in complete remission (n = 24) and those in partial remission (n = 11). Furthermore, we find that patients with severe cytokine release syndrome present with higher abundance of Bifidobacterium, Leuconostoc, Stenotrophomonas, and Staphylococcus, which is reproducible in an independent cohort of 38 MM patients. This study has important implications for understanding the biological role of the microbiome in CAR-T treatment responsiveness of hematologic malignancy patients, and may guide therapeutic intervention to increase efficacy. The success rate of CAR-T cell therapy is high in blood cancers, yet individual patient characteristics might reduce therapeutic benefit. Here we show that therapeutic response in MM, ALL and NHL, and occurrence of severe cytokine release syndrome in multiple myeloma are associated with specific gut microbiome alterations.","The success rate of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy is high in blood cancers, yet individual patient characteristics might reduce therapeutic benefit.

259,GLH/VASA helicases promote germ granule formation to ensure the fidelity of piRNA-mediated transcriptome surveillance,"piRNAs function as guardians of the genome by silencing non-self nucleic acids and transposable elements in animals. Many piRNA factors are enriched in perinuclear germ granules, but whether their localization is required for piRNA biogenesis or function is not known. Here we show that GLH/VASA helicase mutants exhibit defects in forming perinuclear condensates containing PIWI and other small RNA cofactors. These mutant animals produce largely normal levels of piRNA but are defective in triggering piRNA silencing. Strikingly, while many piRNA targets are activated in GLH mutants, we observe that hundreds of endogenous genes are aberrantly silenced by piRNAs. This defect in self versus non-self recognition is also observed in other mutants where perinuclear germ granules are disrupted. Together, our results argue that perinuclear germ granules function critically to promote the fidelity of piRNA-based transcriptome surveillance in C. elegans and preserve self versus non-self distinction.","Phase separated, membrane-less germ granules preserve fertility and cellular function in animal germ cells. Here the authors show that loss of germ granules impacts piRNA pathway fidelity in the recognition of self and non-self nucleic acids.",2022-09-09
260,Liquid-liquid triboelectric nanogenerator based on the immiscible interface of an aqueous two-phase system,"Solid nanogenerators often have limited charge transfer due to their low contact area. Liquid–liquid nanogenerators can transfer a charge better than the solid–solid and solid–liquid counterparts. However, the precise manipulation of the liquid morphology remains a challenge because of the fluidity limits of the liquid. In this work, using the surface tension of a droplet to fix its shape, a liquid-liquid triboelectric nanogenerator in Contact-Separation mode is designed using an immiscible aqueous-aqueous interface, achieving a contact surface charge transfer of 129 nC for a single droplet. The configuration is proven to be applicable in humid environments, and the two-phase materials have good biocompatibility and can be used as an effective drug carrier. Therefore, this nanogenerator is useful for designing future implantable devices. Meanwhile, this design also establishes the foundation of aqueous electronics, and additional applications can be achieved using this route.","While liquid-liquid interface offers better contact and charge transfer potential than solid-based counterparts, fluidity still poses challenges for their application. Here, authors show that charge transfer exists in aqueous two-phase systems and propose a nanogenerator design based on the immiscible aqueous-aqueous interface.",2022-09-09
261,The impact of repeated rapid test strategies on the effectiveness of at-home antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2,"Regular rapid testing can provide twofold benefilts: identifying infectious individuals and providing positive tests sufficiently early during infection that treatment with antivirals can effectively inhibit development of severe disease. Here, we provide a quantitative illustration of the extent of nirmatrelvir-associated treatment benefits that are accrued among high-risk populations when rapid tests are administered at various intervals. Strategies for which tests are administered more frequently are associated with greater reductions in the risk of hospitalization, with weighted risk ratios for testing every other day to once every 2 weeks ranging from 0.17 (95% CI: 0.11–0.28) to 0.77 (95% CI: 0.69–0.83) and correspondingly, higher proportions of the infected population benefiting from treatment, ranging from 0.26 (95% CI: 0.18–0.34) to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.80–0.98), respectively. Importantly, reduced treatment delays, coupled with increased test and treatment coverage, have a critical influence on average treatment benefits, confirming the significance of access.","Antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection are only beneficial when used early in infection, so early case detection is important. Here, the authors assess the frequency of testing needed to achieve population-level benefits and demonstrate the importance of high coverage and short delays from test to treatment.",2022-09-08
262,Allophycocyanin A is a carbon dioxide receptor in the cyanobacterial phycobilisome,"Light harvesting is fundamental for production of ATP and reducing equivalents for CO2 fixation during photosynthesis. However, electronic energy transfer (EET) through a photosystem can harm the photosynthetic apparatus when not balanced with CO2. Here, we show that CO2 binding to the light-harvesting complex modulates EET in photosynthetic cyanobacteria. More specifically, CO2 binding to the allophycocyanin alpha subunit of the light-harvesting complex regulates EET and its fluorescence quantum yield in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. CO2 binding decreases the inter-chromophore distance in the allophycocyanin trimer. The result is enhanced EET in vitro and in live cells. Our work identifies a direct target for CO2 in the cyanobacterial light-harvesting apparatus and provides insights into photosynthesis regulation.","The transfer of electronic energy through a photosystem can harm the photosynthetic apparatus when not balanced with CO2 fixation. Here, the authors show that CO2 modulates electronic energy transfer in cyanobacteria by binding to and enhancing the activity of the light-harvesting complex.",2022-09-08
263,Regulation associated modules reflect 3D genome modularity associated with chromatin activity,"The 3D genome has been shown to be organized into modules including topologically associating domains (TADs) and compartments that are primarily defined by spatial contacts from Hi-C. There exists a gap to investigate whether and how the spatial modularity of the chromatin is related to the functional modularity resulting from chromatin activity. Despite histone modifications reflecting chromatin activity, inferring spatial modularity of the genome directly from the histone modification patterns has not been well explored. Here, we report that histone modifications show a modular pattern (referred to as regulation associated modules, RAMs) that reflects spatial chromatin modularity. Enhancer-promoter interactions, loop anchors, super-enhancer clusters and extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are found to occur more often within the same RAMs than within the same TADs. Consistently, compared to the TAD boundaries, deletions of RAM boundaries perturb the chromatin structure more severely (may even cause cell death) and somatic variants in cancer samples are more enriched in RAM boundaries. These observations suggest that RAMs reflect a modular organization of the 3D genome at a scale better aligned with chromatin activity, providing a bridge connecting the structural and functional modularity of the genome.","Here the authors report histone modifications show a modular pattern referred to as ‘regulation associated modules’ (RAMs) that reflect the spatial modularity of chromatin. They find enhancer-promoter interactions and extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) occur more often within the same RAMs than within the same TADs, indicating stronger insulation of the RAM boundaries.",2022-09-08
264,Pharmacogenomics polygenic risk score for drug response prediction using PRS-PGx methods,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been successfully developed for the prediction of human diseases and complex traits in the past years. For drug response prediction in randomized clinical trials, a common practice is to apply PRS built from a disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) directly to a corresponding pharmacogenomics (PGx) setting. Here, we show that such an approach relies on stringent assumptions about the prognostic and predictive effects of the selected genetic variants. We propose a shift from disease PRS to PGx PRS approaches by simultaneously modeling both the prognostic and predictive effects and further make this shift possible by developing a series of PRS-PGx methods, including a novel Bayesian regression approach (PRS-PGx-Bayes). Simulation studies show that PRS-PGx methods generally outperform the disease PRS methods and PRS-PGx-Bayes is superior to all other PRS-PGx methods. We further apply the PRS-PGx methods to PGx GWAS data from a large cardiovascular randomized clinical trial (IMPROVE-IT) to predict treatment related LDL cholesterol reduction. The results demonstrate substantial improvement of PRS-PGx-Bayes in both prediction accuracy and the capability of capturing the treatment-specific predictive effects while compared with the disease PRS approaches.","To try to predict an individual’s drug response using genetic data, most studies have used traditional polygenic risk score (PRS) methods. Here, the authors develop a pharmacogenomics-specific PRS method, which can improve drug response prediction and patient stratification in pharmacogenomics studies.",2022-09-08
265,IFITM3 restricts virus-induced inflammatory cytokine production by limiting Nogo-B mediated TLR responses,"Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a restriction factor that limits viral pathogenesis and exerts poorly understood immunoregulatory functions. Here, using human and mouse models, we demonstrate that IFITM3 promotes MyD88-dependent, TLR-mediated IL-6 production following exposure to cytomegalovirus (CMV). IFITM3 also restricts IL-6 production in response to influenza and SARS-CoV-2. In dendritic cells, IFITM3 binds to the reticulon 4 isoform Nogo-B and promotes its proteasomal degradation. We reveal that Nogo-B mediates TLR-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production and promotes viral pathogenesis in vivo, and in the case of TLR2 responses, this process involves alteration of TLR2 cellular localization. Nogo-B deletion abrogates inflammatory cytokine responses and associated disease in virus-infected IFITM3-deficient mice. Thus, we uncover Nogo-B as a driver of viral pathogenesis and highlight an immunoregulatory pathway in which IFITM3 fine-tunes the responsiveness of myeloid cells to viral stimulation.","The effect of IFITM3 on viral pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, the authors show that IFITM3 restricts cytomegalovirus pathogenesis by reducing Nogo-B-mediated inflammation in response to viral stimuli.",2022-09-08
266,Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinolines with water over a fluorine-modified cobalt catalyst,"Room temperature and selective hydrogenation of quinolines to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines using a safe and clean hydrogen donor catalyzed by cost-effective materials is significant yet challenging because of the difficult activation of quinolines and H2. Here, a fluorine-modified cobalt catalyst is synthesized via electroreduction of a Co(OH)F precursor that exhibits high activity for electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinolines by using H2O as the hydrogen source to produce 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines with up to 99% selectivity and 94% isolated yield under ambient conditions. Fluorine surface-sites are shown to enhance the adsorption of quinolines and promote water activation to produce active atomic hydrogen (H*) by forming F−-K+(H2O)7 networks. A 1,4/2,3-addition pathway involving H* is proposed through combining experimental and theoretical results. Wide substrate scopes, scalable synthesis of bioactive precursors, facile preparation of deuterated analogues, and the paired synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline and industrially important adiponitrile at a low voltage highlight the promising applications of this methodology.","Selective hydrogenation of quinolines with easy-to-handle hydrogen donors and cost-effective catalysts is desirable. Here electrocatalytic quinoline hydrogenation to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines is reported with water over a fluorine-modified cobalt.",2022-09-08
267,Rab35 governs apicobasal polarity through regulation of actin dynamics during sprouting angiogenesis,"In early blood vessel development, trafficking programs, such as those using Rab GTPases, are tasked with delivering vesicular cargo with high spatiotemporal accuracy. However, the function of many Rab trafficking proteins remain ill-defined in endothelial tissue; therefore, their relevance to blood vessel development is unknown. Rab35 has been shown to play an enigmatic role in cellular behaviors which differs greatly between tissue-type and organism. Importantly, Rab35 has never been characterized for its potential contribution in sprouting angiogenesis; thus, our goal was to map Rab35’s primary function in angiogenesis. Our results demonstrate that Rab35 is critical for sprout formation; in its absence, apicobasal polarity is entirely lost in vitro and in vivo. To determine mechanism, we systematically explored established Rab35 effectors and show that none are operative in endothelial cells. However, we find that Rab35 partners with DENNd1c, an evolutionarily divergent guanine exchange factor, to localize to actin. Here, Rab35 regulates actin polymerization through limiting Rac1 and RhoA activity, which is required to set up proper apicobasal polarity during sprout formation. Our findings establish that Rab35 is a potent brake of actin remodeling during blood vessel development.","The promiscuous GTPase Rab35 has been shown to be involved in many important cellular functions. In this article, Francis et al. illustrate how Rab35 acts as a critical brake to actin remodeling during sprouting angiogenesis and how it is necessary for proper blood vessel development.",2022-09-08
268,A central arctic extreme aerosol event triggered by a warm air-mass intrusion,"Frequency and intensity of warm and moist air-mass intrusions into the Arctic have increased over the past decades and have been related to sea ice melt. During our year-long expedition in the remote central Arctic Ocean, a record-breaking increase in temperature, moisture and downwelling-longwave radiation was observed in mid-April 2020, during an air-mass intrusion carrying air pollutants from northern Eurasia. The two-day intrusion, caused drastic changes in the aerosol size distribution, chemical composition and particle hygroscopicity. Here we show how the intrusion transformed the Arctic from a remote low-particle environment to an area comparable to a central-European urban setting. Additionally, the intrusion resulted in an explosive increase in cloud condensation nuclei, which can have direct effects on Arctic clouds’ radiation, their precipitation patterns, and their lifetime. Thus, unless prompt actions to significantly reduce emissions in the source regions are taken, such intrusion events are expected to continue to affect the Arctic climate.","Warm and moist air-mass intrusions into the Arctic are more frequent than the past decades. Here, the authors show that warm air mass intrusions from northern Eurasia inject record amounts of aerosols into the central Arctic Ocean strongly impacting atmospheric chemistry and cloud properties.",2022-09-08
269,Structural basis for gating mechanism of the human sodium-potassium pump,"P2-type ATPase sodium-potassium pumps (Na+/K+-ATPases) are ion-transporting enzymes that use ATP to transport Na+ and K+ on opposite sides of the lipid bilayer against their electrochemical gradients to maintain ion concentration gradients across the membranes in all animal cells. Despite the available molecular architecture of the Na+/K+-ATPases, a complete molecular mechanism by which the Na+ and K+ ions access into and are released from the pump remains unknown. Here we report five cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human alpha3 Na+/K+-ATPase in its cytoplasmic side-open (E1), ATP-bound cytoplasmic side-open (E1•ATP), ADP-AlF4− trapped Na+-occluded (E1•P-ADP), BeF3− trapped exoplasmic side-open (E2P) and MgF42− trapped K+-occluded (E2•Pi) states. Our work reveals the atomically resolved structural detail of the cytoplasmic gating mechanism of the Na+/K+-ATPase.","Through cryo-EM analysis, here authors reveal conformational rearrangements that are critical for the gating mechanism of the human alpha3 Na+/K+−ATPase",2022-09-08
270,"Multi-pathway DNA-repair reporters reveal competition between end-joining, single-strand annealing and homologous recombination at Cas9-induced DNA double-strand breaks","DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are repaired by multiple distinct pathways, with outcomes ranging from error-free repair to mutagenesis and genomic loss. DSB-repair pathway cross-talk and compensation is incompletely understood, despite its importance for genomic stability, oncogenesis, and genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9. To address this, we constructed and validated three fluorescent Cas9-based reporters, named DSB-Spectrum, that simultaneously quantify the contribution of multiple DNA repair pathways at a DSB. DSB-Spectrum reporters distinguish between DSB-repair by error-free canonical non-homologous end-joining (c-NHEJ) versus homologous recombination (HR; reporter 1), mutagenic repair versus HR (reporter 2), and mutagenic end-joining versus single strand annealing (SSA) versus HR (reporter 3). Using these reporters, we show that inhibiting the c-NHEJ factor DNA-PKcs increases repair by HR, but also substantially increases mutagenic SSA. Our data indicate that SSA-mediated DSB-repair also occurs at endogenous genomic loci, driven by Alu elements or homologous gene regions. Finally, we demonstrate that long-range end-resection factors DNA2 and Exo1 promote SSA and reduce HR, when both pathways compete for the same substrate. These new Cas9-based DSB-Spectrum reporters facilitate the comprehensive analysis of repair pathway crosstalk and DSB-repair outcome.","Correct repair of broken DNA molecules is required to prevent potentially oncogenic mutations. To study repair fidelity and mechanism, van de Kooij et al. developed single cell reporters that detect if DNA breaks are fixed by error-free or mutagenic repair.",2022-09-08
271,QED radiative corrections for accelerator neutrinos,"Neutrino oscillation experiments at accelerator energies aim to establish charge-parity violation in the neutrino sector by measuring the energy-dependent rate of νe appearance and νμ disappearance in a νμ beam. These experiments can precisely measure νμ cross sections at near detectors, but νe cross sections are poorly constrained and require theoretical inputs. In particular, quantum electrodynamics radiative corrections are different for electrons and muons. These corrections are proportional to the small quantum electrodynamics coupling α ≈ 1/137; however, the large separation of scales between the neutrino energy and the proton mass (~GeV), and the electron mass and soft-photon detection thresholds (~MeV) introduces large logarithms in the perturbative expansion. The resulting flavor differences exceed the percent-level experimental precision and depend on nonperturbative hadronic structure. We establish a factorization theorem for exclusive charged-current (anti)neutrino scattering cross sections representing them as a product of two factors. The first factor is flavor universal; it depends on hadronic and nuclear structure and can be constrained by high-statistics νμ data. The second factor is non-universal and contains logarithmic enhancements, but can be calculated exactly in perturbation theory. For charged-current elastic scattering, we demonstrate the cancellation of uncertainties in the predicted ratio of νe and νμ cross sections. We point out the potential impact of non-collinear energetic photons and the distortion of the visible lepton spectra, and provide precise predictions for inclusive observables.","Precisely calculating differences between muon- and electron-neutrino interactions is difficult, but is vital for correctly interpreting neutrino oscillation experiments. Here, the authors determine the effect of electromagnetic quantum corrections in the predicted ratio of ve and vμ cross sections.",2022-09-08
272,Fluorescence-based thermal sensing with elastic organic crystals,"Operation of temperature sensors over extended temperature ranges, and particularly in extreme conditions, poses challenges with both the mechanical integrity of the sensing material and the operational range of the sensor. With an emissive bendable organic crystalline material, here we propose that organic crystals can be used as mechanically robust and compliant fluorescence-based thermal sensors with wide range of temperature coverage and complete retention of mechanical elasticity. The exemplary material described remains elastically bendable and shows highly linear correlation with the emission wavelength and intensity between 77 K to 277 K, while it also transduces its own fluorescence in active waveguiding mode. This universal new approach expands the materials available for optical thermal sensing to a vast number of organic crystals as a new class of engineering materials and opens opportunities for the design of lightweight, organic fluorescence-based thermal sensors that can operate under extreme temperature conditions such as are the ones that will be encountered in future space exploration missions.","A mechanically compliant and robust sensing material is essential for accurate and reliable thermal sensing. Here, the authors report the use of elastic organic crystals as fluorescence-based thermal sensors that cover a wide range of temperatures with complete retention of the sensor’s elasticity.",2022-09-08
273,Comparing the levelized cost of electric vehicle charging options in Europe,"With rapidly decreasing purchase prices of electric vehicles, charging costs are becoming ever more important for the diffusion of electric vehicles as required to decarbonize transport. However, the costs of charging electric vehicles in Europe are largely unknown. Here we develop a systematic classification of charging options, gather extensive market data on equipment cost, and employ a levelized cost approach to model charging costs in 30 European countries (European Union 27, Great Britain, Norway, Switzerland) and for 13 different charging options for private passenger transport. The findings demonstrate a large variance of charging costs across countries and charging options, suggesting different policy options to reduce charging costs. A specific analysis on the impacts and relevance of publicly accessible charging station utilization is performed. The results reveal charging costs at these stations to be competitive with fuel costs at typical utilization rates exhibited already today.","Charging costs are important for the diffusion of electric vehicles as required to decarbonize transport.

274,Meta-analysis reveals weak but pervasive plasticity in insect thermal limits,"Extreme temperature events are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change. Such events threaten insects, including pollinators, pests and disease vectors. Insect critical thermal limits can be enhanced through acclimation, yet evidence that plasticity aids survival at extreme temperatures is limited. Here, using meta-analyses across 1374 effect sizes, 74 studies and 102 species, we show that thermal limit plasticity is pervasive but generally weak: per 1 °C rise in acclimation temperature, critical thermal maximum increases by 0.09 °C; and per 1 °C decline, critical thermal minimum decreases by 0.15 °C. Moreover, small but significant publication bias suggests that the magnitude of plasticity is marginally overestimated. We find juvenile insects are more plastic than adults, highlighting that physiological responses of insects vary through ontogeny. Overall, we show critical thermal limit plasticity is likely of limited benefit to insects during extreme climatic events, yet we need more studies in under-represented taxa and geographic regions.",The ability of organisms to acclimate to high temperatures is increasingly put to test by climate change. This global meta-analysis shows that plasticity of thermal limits in insects is widespread but unlikely to keep pace with climate change.,2022-09-08
275,Germline-somatic JAK2 interactions are associated with clonal expansion in myelofibrosis,"Myelofibrosis is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with high risk for progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Our integrated genomic analysis of up to 933 myelofibrosis cases identifies 6 germline susceptibility loci, 4 of which overlap with previously identified MPN loci. Virtual karyotyping identifies high frequencies of mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs), with enrichment at myelofibrosis GWAS susceptibility loci and recurrently somatically mutated MPN genes (e.g., JAK2). We replicate prior MPN associations showing germline variation at the 9p24.1 risk haplotype confers elevated risk of acquiring JAK2V617F mutations, demonstrating with long-read sequencing that this relationship occurs in cis. We also describe recurrent 9p24.1 large mCAs that selectively retained JAK2V617F mutations. Germline variation associated with longer telomeres is associated with increased myelofibrosis risk. Myelofibrosis cases with high-frequency JAK2 mCAs have marked reductions in measured telomere length – suggesting a relationship between telomere biology and myelofibrosis clonal expansion. Our results advance understanding of the germline-somatic interaction at JAK2 and implicate mCAs involving JAK2 as strong promoters of clonal expansion of those mutated clones.","Myelofibrosis is a risk factor for the development of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.

276,Biomarker correlates with response to NY-ESO-1 TCR T cells in patients with synovial sarcoma,"Autologous T cells transduced to express a high affinity T-cell receptor specific to NY-ESO-1 (letetresgene autoleucel, lete-cel) show promise in the treatment of metastatic synovial sarcoma, with 50% overall response rate. The efficacy of lete-cel treatment in 45 synovial sarcoma patients (NCT01343043) has been previously reported, however, biomarkers predictive of response and resistance remain to be better defined. This post-hoc analysis identifies associations of response to lete-cel with lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen (LDR), product attributes, cell expansion, cytokines, and tumor gene expression. Responders have higher IL-15 levels pre-infusion (p = 0.011) and receive a higher number of transduced effector memory (CD45RA- CCR7-) CD8 + cells per kg (p = 0.039). Post-infusion, responders have increased IFNγ, IL-6, and peak cell expansion (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, and p = 0.016, respectively). Analysis of tumor samples post-treatment illustrates lete-cel infiltration and a decrease in expression of macrophage genes, suggesting remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Here we report potential predictive and pharmacodynamic markers of lete-cel response that may inform LDR, cell dose, and strategies to enhance anticancer efficacy.","Biomarkers predictive of response to T cell therapy remain to be better defined. This study identifies potential predictive and pharmacodynamic markers of response to NY-ESO-1 T-cell therapy in a solid tumor that may inform lymphodepletion, cell dose, and strategies to enhance anticancer efficacy.",2022-09-08
277,Structural and functional characterization of NEMO cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro,"In addition to its essential role in viral polyprotein processing, the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CLpro) can cleave human immune signaling proteins, like NF-κB Essential Modulator (NEMO) and deregulate the host immune response. Here, in vitro assays show that SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro cleaves NEMO with fine-tuned efficiency. Analysis of the 2.50 Å resolution crystal structure of 3CLpro C145S bound to NEMO226–234 reveals subsites that tolerate a range of viral and host substrates through main chain hydrogen bonds while also enforcing specificity using side chain hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Machine learning- and physics-based computational methods predict that variation in key binding residues of 3CLpro-NEMO helps explain the high fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. We posit that cleavage of NEMO is an important piece of information to be accounted for, in the pathology of COVID-19.",The authors report crystallographic and computational studies that detail how SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro cleaves the host NF-κB Essential Modulator in addition to its canonical viral substrates. The association with the high fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is discussed.,2022-09-08
278,MAD2L2 promotes replication fork protection and recovery in a shieldin-independent and REV3L-dependent manner,"Protection of stalled replication forks is essential to prevent genome instability, a major driving force of tumorigenesis. Several key regulators of DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair, including 53BP1 and RIF1, have been implicated in fork protection. MAD2L2, also known as REV7, plays an important role downstream of 53BP1/RIF1 by counteracting resection at DSBs in the recently discovered shieldin complex. The ability to bind and counteract resection at exposed DNA ends at DSBs makes MAD2L2/shieldin a prime candidate for also suppressing nucleolytic processing at stalled replication forks. However, the function of MAD2L2/shieldin outside of DNA repair is unknown. Here we address this by using genetic and single-molecule analyses and find that MAD2L2 is required for protecting and restarting stalled replication forks. MAD2L2 loss leads to uncontrolled MRE11-dependent resection of stalled forks and single-stranded DNA accumulation, which causes irreparable genomic damage. Unexpectedly, MAD2L2 limits resection at stalled forks independently of shieldin, since fork protection remained unaffected by shieldin loss. Instead, MAD2L2 cooperates with the DNA polymerases REV3L and REV1 to promote fork stability. Thus, MAD2L2 suppresses aberrant nucleolytic processing both at DSBs and stalled replication forks by differentially engaging shieldin and REV1/REV3L, respectively.","MAD2L2 – as a member of the shieldin complex - counteracts resection during DNA repair. Here the authors demonstrate that MAD2L2 protects stalled replication forks from excessive resection, in a shieldin-independent and REV3L-dependent manner.",2022-09-08
279,Impact of basic network motifs on the collective response to perturbations,"Many collective phenomena such as epidemic spreading and cascading failures in socioeconomic systems on networks are caused by perturbations of the dynamics. How perturbations propagate through networks, impact and disrupt their functions may depend on the network, the type and location of the perturbation as well as the spreading dynamics. Previous work has analyzed the retardation effects of the nodes along the propagation paths, suggesting a few transient propagation ""scaling” regimes as a function of the nodes’ degree, but regardless of motifs such as triangles. Yet, empirical networks consist of motifs enabling the proper functioning of the system. Here, we show that basic motifs along the propagation path jointly determine the previously proposed scaling regimes of distance-limited propagation and degree-limited propagation, or even cease their existence. Our results suggest a radical departure from these scaling regimes and provide a deeper understanding of the interplay of self-dynamics, interaction dynamics, and topological properties.","Spreading processes and cascading failures on complex networks are often triggered by external perturbations. The authors uncover the impact of network motifs on the processes of perturbations propagation through networks, and networks’ response dynamics.",2022-09-08
280,Structure-function analysis of enterovirus protease 2A in complex with its essential host factor SETD3,"Enteroviruses cause a number of medically relevant and widespread human diseases with no approved antiviral therapies currently available. Host-directed therapies present an enticing option for this diverse genus of viruses. We have previously identified the actin histidine methyltransferase SETD3 as a critical host factor physically interacting with the viral protease 2A. Here, we report the 3.5 Å cryo-EM structure of SETD3 interacting with coxsackievirus B3 2A at two distinct interfaces, including the substrate-binding surface within the SET domain. Structure-function analysis revealed that mutations of key residues in the SET domain resulted in severely reduced binding to 2A and complete protection from enteroviral infection. Our findings provide insight into the molecular basis of the SETD3-2A interaction and a framework for the rational design of host-directed therapeutics against enteroviruses.","Actin histidine methyltransferase SETD3 is a host factor critical for the replication of enteroviruses. Here, the authors report the 3.5 Å cryoEM structure of SETD3 interacting with enterovirus CV-B3 2A protease, defining the actin-binding SET domain as essential for virus replication.",2022-09-08
281,Ca2+-modulated photoactivatable imaging reveals neuron-astrocyte glutamatergic circuitries within the nucleus accumbens,"Astrocytes are key elements of brain circuits that are involved in different aspects of the neuronal physiology relevant to brain functions. Although much effort is being made to understand how the biology of astrocytes affects brain circuits, astrocytic network heterogeneity and plasticity is still poorly defined. Here, we have combined structural and functional imaging of astrocyte activity recorded in mice using the Ca2+-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator and specific optostimulation of glutamatergic pathways to map the functional neuron-astrocyte circuitries in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We showed pathway-specific astrocytic responses induced by selective optostimulation of main inputs from the prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, and ventral hippocampus. Furthermore, co-stimulation of glutamatergic pathways induced non-linear Ca2+-signaling integration, revealing integrative properties of NAc astrocytes. All these results demonstrate the existence of specific neuron-astrocyte circuits in the NAc, providing an insight to the understanding of how the NAc integrates information.","Neuron-astrocyte communication is fundamental for brain physiology, yet the heterogeneity in the functional interaction between these two elements remains poorly understood. Here we show how different neuron-astrocyte networks integrate information from distinct glutamatergic inputs.",2022-09-07
282,Modern groundwater reaches deeper depths in heavily pumped aquifer systems,"Deep groundwater is an important source of drinking water, and can be preferable to shallower groundwaters where they are polluted by surface-borne contaminants. Surface-borne contaminants are disproportionately common in ‘modern’ groundwaters that are made up of precipitation that fell since the ~1950s. Some local-scale studies have suggested that groundwater pumping can draw modern groundwater downward and potentially pollute deep aquifers, but the prevalence of such pumping-induced downwelling at continental scale is not known. Here we analyse thousands of US groundwater tritium measurements to show that modern groundwater tends to reach deeper depths in heavily pumped aquifer systems. These findings imply that groundwater pumping can draw mobile surface-borne pollutants to deeper depths than they would reach in the absence of pumping. We conclude that intensive groundwater pumping can draw recently recharged groundwater deeper into aquifer systems, potentially endangering deep groundwater quality.","Decades-old groundwater is vulnerable to pollution from land uses. This work shows that decades old groundwater flows to deep depths where groundwater pumping is more intense, implying that groundwater pumping can endanger deep groundwater quality.",2022-09-07
283,Gate-controlled skyrmion and domain wall chirality,"Magnetic skyrmions are localized chiral spin textures, which offer great promise to store and process information at the nanoscale. In the presence of asymmetric exchange interactions, their chirality, which governs their dynamics, is generally considered as an intrinsic parameter set during the sample deposition. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that a gate voltage can control this key parameter. We probe the chirality of skyrmions and chiral domain walls by observing the direction of their current-induced motion and show that a gate voltage can reverse it. This local and dynamical reversal of the chirality is due to a sign inversion of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that we attribute to ionic migration of oxygen under gate voltage. Micromagnetic simulations show that the chirality reversal is a continuous transformation, in which the skyrmion is conserved. This control of chirality with 2–3 V gate voltage can be used for skyrmion-based logic devices, yielding new functionalities.","A major feature defining the motion of magnetic spin textures is the chirality or ’handedness’ of the spin texture, which in turn depends on the underlying material. Normally it is considered as fixed, but in this article Fillion et al demonstrate control of the chirality of skyrmions in a ferromagnetic multilayer, switching the chirality back and forth using an applied gate voltage.",2022-09-07
284,Derivation and validation of an epigenetic frailty risk score in population-based cohorts of older adults,"DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns in peripheral blood have been shown to be associated with aging related health outcomes. We perform an epigenome-wide screening to identify CpGs related to frailty, defined by a frailty index (FI), in a large population-based cohort of older adults from Germany, the ESTHER study. Sixty-five CpGs are identified as frailty related methylation loci. Using LASSO regression, 20 CpGs are selected to derive a DNAm based algorithm for predicting frailty, the epigenetic frailty risk score (eFRS). The eFRS exhibits strong associations with frailty at baseline and after up to five-years of follow-up independently of established frailty risk factors. These associations are confirmed in another independent population-based cohort study, the KORA-Age study, conducted in older adults. In conclusion, we identify 65 CpGs as frailty-related loci, of which 20 CpGs are used to calculate the eFRS with predictive performance for frailty over long-term follow-up.","Frailty is associated with an increased risk for negative health outcomes in older populations, and being able to predict frailty could facilitate prevention measures. By performing an epigenome-wide screen, the authors derived a DNA methylation based measure for frailty which can predict both prevalence and longer-term incidence of frailty.",2022-09-07
285,Combination of T cell-redirecting bispecific antibody ERY974 and chemotherapy reciprocally enhances efficacy against non-inflamed tumours,"Identifying a strategy with strong efficacy against non-inflamed tumours is vital in cancer immune therapy. ERY974 is a humanized IgG4 bispecific T cell-redirecting antibody that recognizes glypican-3 and CD3. Here we examine the combination effect of ERY974 and chemotherapy (paclitaxel, cisplatin, and capecitabine) in the treatment of non-inflamed tumours in a xenograft model. ERY974 monotherapy shows a minor antitumour effect on non-inflamed NCI-H446 xenografted tumours, as infiltration of ERY974-redirected T cells is limited to the tumour-stromal boundary. However, combination therapy improves efficacy by promoting T cell infiltration into the tumour centre, and increasing ERY974 distribution in the tumour. ERY974 increases capecitabine-induced cytotoxicity by promoting capecitabine conversion to its active form by inducing thymidine phosphorylase expression in non-inflamed MKN45 tumour through ERY974-induced IFNγ and TNFα in T cells. We show that ERY974 with chemotherapy synergistically and reciprocally increases antitumour efficacy, eradicating non-inflamed tumours.","T-cell redirecting bispecific antibodies have emerged as therapeutic agents to promote T-cell mediated killing of tumor cells. Here the authors show that a combination of chemotherapy and ERY974, a bispecific antibody that targets glypican-3 and CD3, facilitates T cell infiltration and promotes anti-tumor responses also in non-inflamed tumors.",2022-09-07
286,Pushing the limits of remote RF sensing by reading lips under the face mask,"The problem of Lip-reading has become an important research challenge in recent years. The goal is to recognise speech from lip movements. Most of the Lip-reading technologies developed so far are camera-based, which require video recording of the target. However, these technologies have well-known limitations of occlusion and ambient lighting with serious privacy concerns. Furthermore, vision-based technologies are not useful for multi-modal hearing aids in the coronavirus (COVID-19) environment, where face masks have become a norm. This paper aims to solve the fundamental limitations of camera-based systems by proposing a radio frequency (RF) based Lip-reading framework, having an ability to read lips under face masks. The framework employs Wi-Fi and radar technologies as enablers of RF sensing based Lip-reading. A dataset comprising of vowels A, E, I, O, U and empty (static/closed lips) is collected using both technologies, with a face mask. The collected data is used to train machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. A high classification accuracy of 95% is achieved on the Wi-Fi data utilising neural network (NN) models. Moreover, similar accuracy is achieved by VGG16 deep learning model on the collected radar-based dataset.","This study aims to solve the fundamental limitations of camera-based systems by proposing a contactless and privacy-preserving radio frequency-based lip-reading framework, which can recognise lip movements under face masks.",2022-09-07
287,Circuit analysis reveals a neural pathway for light avoidance in Drosophila larvae,"Understanding how neural circuits underlie behaviour is challenging even in the connectome era because it requires a combination of anatomical and functional analyses. This is exemplified in the circuit underlying the light avoidance behaviour displayed by Drosophila melanogaster larvae. While this behaviour is robust and the nervous system relatively simple, the circuit is only partially delineated with some contradictions among studies. Here, we devise trans-Tango MkII, an offshoot of the transsynaptic circuit tracing tool trans-Tango, and implement it in anatomical tracing together with functional analysis. We use neuronal inhibition to test necessity of particular neuronal types in light avoidance and selective neuronal activation to examine sufficiency in rescuing light avoidance deficiencies exhibited by photoreceptor mutants. Our studies reveal a four-order circuit for light avoidance connecting the light-detecting photoreceptors with a pair of neuroendocrine cells via two types of clock neurons. This approach can be readily expanded to studying other circuits.","Studying neural circuits requires a multipronged approach. Here, the authors present a transsynaptic tracing tool in fruit fly larvae and combine it with neuronal inhibition and activation to study the circuit underlying light avoidance behaviour.",2022-09-07
288,Systematic analysis of low-affinity transcription factor binding site clusters in vitro and in vivo establishes their functional relevance,"Binding to binding site clusters has yet to be characterized in depth, and the functional relevance of low-affinity clusters remains uncertain. We characterized transcription factor binding to low-affinity clusters in vitro and found that transcription factors can bind concurrently to overlapping sites, challenging the notion of binding exclusivity. Furthermore, small clusters with binding sites an order of magnitude lower in affinity give rise to high mean occupancies at physiologically-relevant transcription factor concentrations. To assess whether the observed in vitro occupancies translate to transcriptional activation in vivo, we tested low-affinity binding site clusters in a synthetic and native gene regulatory network in S. cerevisiae. In both systems, clusters of low-affinity binding sites generated transcriptional output comparable to single or even multiple consensus sites. This systematic characterization demonstrates that clusters of low-affinity binding sites achieve substantial occupancies, and that this occupancy can drive expression in eukaryotic promoters.","Here the authors quantitatively characterize binding to transcription factor (TF) binding site clusters in vitro, followed by characterizing clusters in synthetic and native gene regulatory systems in yeast. They show low-affinity clusters achieve high TF occupancies in vitro and gene activation in vivo, suggesting occupancy rather than individual TF dwell times drive transcriptional activation.",2022-09-07
289,High performance polymerized small molecule acceptor by synergistic optimization on π-bridge linker and side chain,"The polymerized small-molecule acceptors have attracted great attention for application as polymer acceptor in all-polymer solar cells recently. The modification of small molecule acceptor building block and the π-bridge linker is an effective strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of the polymer acceptors. In this work, we synthesized a new polymer acceptor PG-IT2F which is a modification of the representative polymer acceptor PY-IT by replacing its upper linear alkyl side chains on the small molecule building block with branched alkyl chains and attaching difluorene substituents on its thiophene π-bridge linker. Through this synergistic optimization, PG-IT2F possesses more suitable phase separation, increased charge transportation, better exciton dissociation, lower bimolecular recombination, and longer charge transfer state lifetime than PY-IT in their polymer solar cells with PM6 as polymer donor. Therefore, the devices based on PM6:PG-IT2F demonstrated a high power conversion efficiency of 17.24%, which is one of the highest efficiency reported for the binary all polymer solar cells to date. This work indicates that the synergistic regulation of small molecule acceptor building block and π-bridge linker plays a key role in designing and developing highly efficient polymer acceptors.","The modification of small molecule acceptor building block and π−bridge linker is effective to improve photovoltaic performance. Here, the authors replace linear with branched alkyl chains and introduce difluorene-substituted linker to realise all-polymer solar cells with efficiency of 17.24%.",2022-09-07
290,Generalised optical printing of photocurable metal chalcogenides,"Optical three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques have attracted tremendous attention owing to their applicability to mask-less additive manufacturing, which enables the cost-effective and straightforward creation of patterned architectures. However, despite their potential use as alternatives to traditional lithography, the printable materials obtained from these methods are strictly limited to photocurable resins, thereby restricting the functionality of the printed objects and their application areas. Herein, we report a generalised direct optical printing technique to obtain functional metal chalcogenides via digital light processing. We developed universally applicable photocurable chalcogenidometallate inks that could be directly used to create 2D patterns or micrometre-thick 2.5D architectures of various sizes and shapes. Our process is applicable to a diverse range of functional metal chalcogenides for compound semiconductors and 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides. We then demonstrated the feasibility of our technique by fabricating and evaluating a micro-scale thermoelectric generator bearing tens of patterned semiconductors. Our approach shows potential for simple and cost-effective architecturing of functional inorganic materials.","Optical 3D printing techniques are low-cost mask-less patterning methods, but their application is limited by the number of printable materials. Here, the authors report a generalized optical method to print 2D or micrometre-thick 2.5D architectures based on metal chalcogenides inks, showing the realization of micro-scale thermoelectric generators.",2022-09-07
291,Transition metal migration and O2 formation underpin voltage hysteresis in oxygen-redox disordered rocksalt cathodes,"Lithium-rich disordered rocksalt cathodes display high capacities arising from redox chemistry on both transition-metal ions (TM-redox) and oxygen ions (O-redox), making them promising candidates for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, the atomic-scale mechanisms governing O-redox behaviour in disordered structures are not fully understood. Here we show that, at high states of charge in the disordered rocksalt Li2MnO2F, transition metal migration is necessary for the formation of molecular O2 trapped in the bulk. Density functional theory calculations reveal that O2 is thermodynamically favoured over other oxidised O species, which is confirmed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering data showing only O2 forms. When O-redox involves irreversible Mn migration, this mechanism results in a path-dependent voltage hysteresis between charge and discharge, commensurate with the hysteresis observed electrochemically. The implications are that irreversible transition metal migration should be suppressed to reduce the voltage hysteresis that afflicts O-redox disordered rocksalt cathodes.","The oxygen-redox mechanism in lithium-rich disordered rocksalt cathode materials is still not well understood. Here, the authors show that in Li2MnO2F, molecular oxygen forms in the bulk during charge and is re-incorporated into the structure as oxygen anions on discharge, but this process is associated with irreversible Mn migration, causing voltage hysteresis.",2022-09-07
292,"TENT2, TUT4, and TUT7 selectively regulate miRNA sequence and abundance","TENTs generate miRNA isoforms by 3’ tailing. However, little is known about how tailing regulates miRNA function. Here, we generate isogenic HEK293T cell lines in which TENT2, TUT4 and TUT7 are knocked out individually or in combination. Together with rescue experiments, we characterize TENT-specific effects by deep sequencing, Northern blot and in vitro assays. We find that 3’ tailing is not random but highly specific. In addition to its known adenylation, TENT2 contributes to guanylation and uridylation on mature miRNAs. TUT4 uridylates most miRNAs whereas TUT7 is dispensable. Removing adenylation has a marginal impact on miRNA levels. By contrast, abolishing uridylation leads to dysregulation of a set of miRNAs. Besides let-7, miR-181b and miR-222 are negatively regulated by TUT4/7 via distinct mechanisms while the miR-888 cluster is upregulated specifically by TUT7. Our results uncover the selective actions of TENTs in generating 3’ isomiRs and pave the way to investigate their functions.","The authors reveal insights into miRNA tailing specificity of TENTs and their effect on miRNA levels by combinatory KOs of TENT2, TUT4 and TUT7. They show uridylation is linked to TENT2 and identify non-redundant functions between TUT4 and TUT7.",2022-09-07
293,Beiging of perivascular adipose tissue regulates its inflammation and vascular remodeling,"Although inflammation plays critical roles in the development of atherosclerosis, its regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been reported to undergo inflammatory changes in response to vascular injury. Here, we show that vascular injury induces the beiging (brown adipose tissue-like phenotype change) of PVAT, which fine-tunes inflammatory response and thus vascular remodeling as a protective mechanism. In a mouse model of endovascular injury, macrophages accumulate in PVAT, causing beiging phenotype change. Inhibition of PVAT beiging by genetically silencing PRDM16, a key regulator to beiging, exacerbates inflammation and vascular remodeling following injury. Conversely, activation of PVAT beiging attenuates inflammation and pathological vascular remodeling. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that beige adipocytes abundantly express neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) which critically regulate alternative macrophage activation. Importantly, significant beiging is observed in the diseased aortic PVAT in patients with acute aortic dissection. Taken together, vascular injury induces the beiging of adjacent PVAT with macrophage accumulation, where NRG4 secreted from the beige PVAT facilitates alternative activation of macrophages, leading to the resolution of vascular inflammation. Our study demonstrates the pivotal roles of PVAT in vascular inflammation and remodeling and will open a new avenue for treating atherosclerosis.","Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been reported to undergo inflammatory changes in response to vascular injury.

294,devCellPy is a machine learning-enabled pipeline for automated annotation of complex multilayered single-cell transcriptomic data,"A major informatic challenge in single cell RNA-sequencing analysis is the precise annotation of datasets where cells exhibit complex multilayered identities or transitory states. Here, we present devCellPy a highly accurate and precise machine learning-enabled tool that enables automated prediction of cell types across complex annotation hierarchies. To demonstrate the power of devCellPy, we construct a murine cardiac developmental atlas from published datasets encompassing 104,199 cells from E6.5-E16.5 and train devCellPy to generate a cardiac prediction algorithm. Using this algorithm, we observe a high prediction accuracy (>90%) across multiple layers of annotation and across de novo murine developmental data. Furthermore, we conduct a cross-species prediction of cardiomyocyte subtypes from in vitro-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells and unexpectedly uncover a predominance of left ventricular (LV) identity that we confirmed by an LV-specific TBX5 lineage tracing system. Together, our results show devCellPy to be a useful tool for automated cell prediction across complex cellular hierarchies, species, and experimental systems.","A major informatic challenge in single cell RNA-sequencing analysis is the precise annotation of datasets where cells exhibit complex multilayered identities or transitory states.

295,Integrated cohort of esophageal squamous cell cancer reveals genomic features underlying clinical characteristics,"Esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) is the major pathologic type of esophageal cancer in Asian population. To systematically evaluate the mutational features underlying clinical characteristics, we establish the integrated dataset of ESCC-META that consists of 1930 ESCC genomes from 33 datasets. The data process pipelines lead to well homogeneity of this integrated cohort for further analysis. We identified 11 mutational signatures in ESCC, some of which are related to clinical features, and firstly detect the significant mutated hotspots in TGFBR2 and IRF2BPL. We screen the survival related mutational features and found some genes had different prognostic impacts between early and late stage, such as PIK3CA and NFE2L2. Based on the results, an applicable approach of mutational score is proposed and validated to predict prognosis in ESCC. As an open-sourced, quality-controlled and updating mutational landscape, the ESCC-META dataset could facilitate further genomic and translational study in this field.","The mutational landscape of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) remains poorly characterised. Here, the authors integrate multiple published datasets and systematically evaluate the mutational signatures and the related genomic and clinical features in ESCC.",2022-09-07
296,Drivers and distribution of global ocean heat uptake over the last half century,"Since the 1970s, the ocean has absorbed almost all of the additional energy in the Earth system due to greenhouse warming. However, sparse observations limit our knowledge of where ocean heat uptake (OHU) has occurred and where this heat is stored today. Here, we equilibrate a reanalysis-forced ocean-sea ice model, using a spin-up that improves on earlier approaches, to investigate recent OHU trends basin-by-basin and associated separately with surface wind trends, thermodynamic properties (temperature, humidity and radiation) or both. Wind and thermodynamic changes each explain ~ 50% of global OHU, while Southern Ocean forcing trends can account for almost all of the global OHU. This OHU is enabled by cool sea surface temperatures and sensible heat gain when atmospheric thermodynamic properties are held fixed, while downward longwave radiation dominates when winds are fixed. These results address long-standing limitations in multidecadal ocean-sea ice model simulations to reconcile estimates of OHU, transport and storage.","This study improves on limitations of the most commonly used spin-up approach for ocean-sea ice models. The authors find that, over the last 50 years, atmospheric changes over the Southern Ocean have driven almost all of the global ocean heat uptake.",2022-09-07
297,High p16 expression and heterozygous RB1 loss are biomarkers for CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance in ER+ breast cancer,"CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy have demonstrated higher antitumor activity than endocrine therapy alone for the treatment of advanced estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Some of these tumors are de novo resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors and others develop acquired resistance. Here, we show that p16 overexpression is associated with reduced antitumor activity of CDK4/6 inhibitors in patient-derived xenografts (n = 37) and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines, as well as reduced response of early and advanced breast cancer patients to CDK4/6 inhibitors (n = 89). We also identified heterozygous RB1 loss as biomarker of acquired resistance and poor clinical outcome. Combination of the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib with the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib showed antitumor activity in estrogen receptor-positive non-basal-like breast cancer patient-derived xenografts, independently of PIK3CA, ESR1 or RB1 mutation, also in drug de-escalation experiments or omitting endocrine therapy. Our results offer insights into predicting primary/acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors and post-progression therapeutic strategies.","CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance is common in breast cancer. Here, the authors show that p16 overexpression may be linked to reduced efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibition, and show that the combination with PI3K inhibitors may increase anti-tumour effects.",2022-09-07
298,Ultra-depleted hydrogen isotopes in hydrated glass record Late Cretaceous glaciation in Antarctica,"The Early Jurassic Butcher Ridge Igneous Complex (BRIC) in the Transantarctic Mountains contains abundant and variably hydrated silicic glass which has the potential to preserve a rich paleoclimate record. Here we present Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopic data that indicates BRIC glasses contain up to ~8 wt.% molecular water (H2Om), and low (<0.8 wt.%) hydroxyl (OH) component, interpreted as evidence for secondary hydration by meteoric water. BRIC glasses contain the most depleted hydrogen isotopes yet measured in terrestrial rocks, down to δD = −325 ‰. In situ 40Ar/39Ar geochronology of hydrated glasses with ultra-depleted δD values yield ages from 105 Ma to 72 Ma with a peak at c. 91.4 Ma. Combined, these data suggest hydration of BRIC glasses by polar glacial ice and melt water during the Late Cretaceous, contradicting paleoclimate reconstructions of this period that suggest Antarctica was ice-free and part of a global hot greenhouse.","Analysis of volcanic glass from the Transantarctic Mountains suggests that 90 Million years ago glaciation was widespread in Antarctica, a period in Earth’s history when the continent was considered to be ice-free and part of a global greenhouse.",2022-09-07
299,Microbial biofilms as living photoconductors due to ultrafast electron transfer in cytochrome OmcS nanowires,"Light-induced microbial electron transfer has potential for efficient production of value-added chemicals, biofuels and biodegradable materials owing to diversified metabolic pathways. However, most microbes lack photoactive proteins and require synthetic photosensitizers that suffer from photocorrosion, photodegradation, cytotoxicity, and generation of photoexcited radicals that are harmful to cells, thus severely limiting the catalytic performance. Therefore, there is a pressing need for biocompatible photoconductive materials for efficient electronic interface between microbes and electrodes. Here we show that living biofilms of Geobacter sulfurreducens use nanowires of cytochrome OmcS as intrinsic photoconductors. Photoconductive atomic force microscopy shows up to 100-fold increase in photocurrent in purified individual nanowires. Photocurrents respond rapidly (<100 ms) to the excitation and persist reversibly for hours. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum dynamics simulations reveal ultrafast (~200 fs) electron transfer between nanowire hemes upon photoexcitation, enhancing carrier density and mobility. Our work reveals a new class of natural photoconductors for whole-cell catalysis.","Despite enormous potential of solar-driven biocatalysis, most living systems lack photoactive proteins and require toxic and expensive synthetic materials limiting the performance. Here, a class of natural photoconductors is demonstrated through sub-picosecond heme-to-heme electron transfer in bacteria-produced protein nanowires.",2022-09-07
300,Multimodal single cell sequencing implicates chromatin accessibility and genetic background in diabetic kidney disease progression,"The proximal tubule is a key regulator of kidney function and glucose metabolism. Diabetic kidney disease leads to proximal tubule injury and changes in chromatin accessibility that modify the activity of transcription factors involved in glucose metabolism and inflammation. Here we use single nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to show that diabetic kidney disease leads to reduced accessibility of glucocorticoid receptor binding sites and an injury-associated expression signature in the proximal tubule. We hypothesize that chromatin accessibility is regulated by genetic background and closely-intertwined with metabolic memory, which pre-programs the proximal tubule to respond differently to external stimuli. Glucocorticoid excess has long been known to increase risk for type 2 diabetes, which raises the possibility that glucocorticoid receptor inhibition may mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of diabetic kidney disease.",Diabetic kidney disease leads to changes in glucose metabolism and inflammation. Here the authors use multimodal single cell sequencing to show that this disease leads to reduced accessibility of glucocorticoid receptor binding sites in the proximal tubule and increased gluconeogenesis.,2022-09-06
301,Dissecting the role of the human microbiome in COVID-19 via metagenome-assembled genomes,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily a respiratory disease caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is often accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms. However, little is known about the relation between the human microbiome and COVID-19, largely due to the fact that most previous studies fail to provide high taxonomic resolution to identify microbes that likely interact with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we used whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing data together with assembly and binning strategies to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 514 COVID-19 related nasopharyngeal and fecal samples in six independent cohorts. We reconstructed a total of 11,584 medium-and high-quality microbial MAGs and obtained 5403 non-redundant MAGs (nrMAGs) with strain-level resolution. We found that there is a significant reduction of strain richness for many species in the gut microbiome of COVID-19 patients. The gut microbiome signatures can accurately distinguish COVID-19 cases from healthy controls and predict the progression of COVID-19. Moreover, we identified a set of nrMAGs with a putative causal role in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and revealed their functional pathways that potentially interact with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we demonstrated that the main findings of our study can be largely validated in three independent cohorts. The presented results highlight the importance of incorporating the human gut microbiome in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease progression.","Here, using whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing data from patients with COVID-19 and controls, the authors reconstruct 11,584 microbial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) including 5,403 non-redundant MAGs, revealing microbiota and metabolic pathways associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection at strain-level resolution.",2022-09-06
302,Substrate multiplexed protein engineering facilitates promiscuous biocatalytic synthesis,"Enzymes with high activity are readily produced through protein engineering, but intentionally and efficiently engineering enzymes for an expanded substrate scope is a contemporary challenge. One approach to address this challenge is Substrate Multiplexed Screening (SUMS), where enzyme activity is measured on competing substrates. SUMS has long been used to rigorously quantitate native enzyme specificity, primarily for in vivo settings. SUMS has more recently found sporadic use as a protein engineering approach but has not been widely adopted by the field, despite its potential utility. Here, we develop principles of how to design and interpret SUMS assays to guide protein engineering. This rich information enables improving activity with multiple substrates simultaneously, identifies enzyme variants with altered scope, and indicates potential mutational hot-spots as sites for further engineering. These advances leverage common laboratory equipment and represent a highly accessible and customizable method for enzyme engineering.","Efficient engineering of enzymes for expanded substrate scope is currently challenging. Here, the authors develop simple principles of how to design and interpret Substrate Multiplexed Screening assays to guide protein engineering to enable activity improvements with simultaneously with multiple substrates.",2022-09-06
303,Long read genome assemblies complemented by single cell RNA-sequencing reveal genetic and cellular mechanisms underlying the adaptive evolution of yak,"Wild yak (Bos mutus) and domestic yak (Bos grunniens) are adapted to high altitude environment and have ecological, economic, and cultural significances on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Currently, the genetic and cellular bases underlying adaptations of yak to extreme conditions remains elusive. In the present study, we assembled two chromosome-level genomes, one each for wild yak and domestic yak, and screened structural variants (SVs) through the long-read data of yak and taurine cattle. The results revealed that 6733 genes contained high-FST SVs. 127 genes carrying special type of SVs were differentially expressed in lungs of the taurine cattle and yak. We then constructed the first single-cell gene expression atlas of yak and taurine cattle lung tissues and identified a yak-specific endothelial cell subtype. By integrating SVs and single-cell transcriptome data, we revealed that the endothelial cells expressed the highest proportion of marker genes carrying high-FST SVs in taurine cattle lungs. Furthermore, we identified pathways which were related to the medial thickness and formation of elastic fibers in yak lungs. These findings provide new insights into the high-altitude adaptation of yak and have important implications for understanding the physiological and pathological responses of large mammals and humans to hypoxia.","The genetic bases of yak adaptations to extreme conditions remains elusive. This study compares yak and cattle at a genomic and transcriptomic level, revealing a new type of endothelial cell and candidate genes related with elastic fiber formation in yak lungs that might contribute to high altitude adaptation.",2022-09-06
304,Near-infrared II plasmonic porous cubic nanoshells for in vivo noninvasive SERS visualization of sub-millimeter microtumors,"In vivo surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging allows non-invasive visualization of tumors for intraoperative guidance and clinical diagnostics. However, the in vivo utility of SERS is greatly hampered by the strong optical scattering and autofluorescence background of biological tissues and the lack of highly active plasmonic nanostructures. Herein, we report a class of porous nanostructures comprising a cubic AuAg alloy nanoshell and numerous nanopores. Such porous nanostructures exhibit excellent near-infrared II plasmonic properties tunable in a broad spectral range by varying the pore features while maintaining a small dimension. We demonstrate their exceptional near-infrared II SERS performance varying with the porous properties. Additionally, near-infrared II SERS probes created with porous cubic AuAg nanoshells are demonstrated with remarkable capability for in vivo visualization of sub-millimeter microtumors in a living mouse model. Our near-infrared II SERS probes hold great potentials for precise demarcation of tumor margins and identification of microscopic tumors.","In vivo surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging allows non-invasive visualization of tumours for biomedical applications. Here, the authors report porous cubic AuAg alloy nanoshells exhibiting plasmonic properties and porosity-dependant SERS in the second window of the near-infrared for in vivo tumour detection.",2022-09-06
305,Hydrogen production from the air,"Green hydrogen produced by water splitting using renewable energy is the most promising energy carrier of the low-carbon economy. However, the geographic mismatch between renewables distribution and freshwater availability poses a significant challenge to its production. Here, we demonstrate a method of direct hydrogen production from the air, namely, in situ capture of freshwater from the atmosphere using hygroscopic electrolyte and electrolysis powered by solar or wind with a current density up to 574 mA cm−2. A prototype of such has been established and operated for 12 consecutive days with a stable performance at a Faradaic efficiency around 95%. This so-called direct air electrolysis (DAE) module can work under a bone-dry environment with a relative humidity of 4%, overcoming water supply issues and producing green hydrogen sustainably with minimal impact to the environment. The DAE modules can be easily scaled to provide hydrogen to remote, (semi-) arid, and scattered areas.","While obtaining H2 from water splitting offers a promising strategy for renewable fuel production, current technologies rely on liquid freshwater. Here, authors use a hygroscopic electrolyte to achieve electrocatalytic water vapor splitting driven by renewable resources without liquid water.",2022-09-06
306,Fluorescence-based monitoring of the pressure-induced aggregation microenvironment evolution for an AIEgen under multiple excitation channels,"The development of organic solid-state luminescent materials, especially those sensitive to aggregation microenvironment, is critical for their applications in devices such as pressure-sensitive elements, sensors, and photoelectric devices. However, it still faces certain challenges and a deep understanding of the corresponding internal mechanisms is required. Here, we put forward an unconventional strategy to explore the pressure-induced evolution of the aggregation microenvironment, involving changes in molecular conformation, stacking mode, and intermolecular interaction, by monitoring the emission under multiple excitation channels based on a luminogen with aggregation-induced emission characteristics of di(p-methoxylphenyl)dibenzofulvene. Under three excitation wavelengths, the distinct emission behaviors have been interestingly observed to reveal the pressure-induced structural evolution, well consistent with the results from ultraviolet-visible absorption, high-pressure angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction, and infrared studies, which have rarely been reported before. This finding provides important insights into the design of organic solid luminescent materials and greatly promotes the development of stimulus-responsive luminescent materials.","The develop of organic functional materials requires the exploration of the pressure dependent emissive mechanisms of molecular structures, conformations and stacking modes. Here, Tong et al propose a strategy for monitoring the pressure-induced fluorescence under multiple excitation channels.",2022-09-06
307,Generation of an Escherichia coli strain growing on methanol via the ribulose monophosphate cycle,"Methanol is a liquid with high energy storage capacity that holds promise as an alternative substrate to replace sugars in the biotechnology industry. It can be produced from CO2 or methane and its use does not compete with food and animal feed production. However, there are currently only limited biotechnological options for the valorization of methanol, which hinders its widespread adoption. Here, we report the conversion of the industrial platform organism Escherichia coli into a synthetic methylotroph that assimilates methanol via the energy efficient ribulose monophosphate cycle. Methylotrophy is achieved after evolution of a methanol-dependent E. coli strain over 250 generations in continuous chemostat culture. We demonstrate growth on methanol and biomass formation exclusively from the one-carbon source by 13C isotopic tracer analysis. In line with computational modeling, the methylotrophic E. coli strain optimizes methanol oxidation by upregulation of an improved methanol dehydrogenase, increasing ribulose monophosphate cycle activity, channeling carbon flux through the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and downregulating tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. En route towards sustainable bioproduction processes, our work lays the foundation for the efficient utilization of methanol as the dominant carbon and energy resource.","Using one carbon compounds as feedstock is a promising approach in abating climate change. Here, the authors report the conversion of E. coli into a synthetic methylotroph that assimilates methanol via the ribulose monophosphate cycle and a set of distinctive mutations.",2022-09-06
308,Multiplexed mobilization and expression of biosynthetic gene clusters,"Bacterial genomes contain large reservoirs of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are predicted to encode unexplored natural products. Heterologous expression of previously unstudied BGCs should facilitate the discovery of additional therapeutically relevant bioactive molecules from bacterial culture collections, but the large-scale manipulation of BGCs remains cumbersome. Here, we describe a method to parallelize the identification, mobilization and heterologous expression of BGCs. Our solution simultaneously captures large numbers of BGCs by cloning the genomes of a strain collection in a large-insert library and uses the CONKAT-seq (co-occurrence network analysis of targeted sequences) sequencing pipeline to efficiently localize clones carrying intact BGCs which represent candidates for heterologous expression. Our discovery of several natural products, including an antibiotic that is active against multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, demonstrates the potential of leveraging economies of scale with this approach to systematically interrogate cryptic BGCs contained in strain collections.","Efficient mobilization and expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) into heterologous hosts is needed for microbial natural products discovery. Here, the authors improve the CONKAT-seq strategy by simultaneously capturing the BCGs into a single large insert library and demonstrate its ability to discover natural products with new structures and potent antibacterial activity.",2022-09-06
309,On the origin of elasticity and heat conduction anisotropy of liquid crystal elastomers at gigahertz frequencies,"Liquid crystal elastomers that offer exceptional load-deformation response at low frequencies often require consideration of the mechanical anisotropy only along the two symmetry directions. However, emerging applications operating at high frequencies require all five true elastic constants. Here, we utilize Brillouin light spectroscopy to obtain the engineering moduli and probe the strain dependence of the elasticity anisotropy at gigahertz frequencies. The Young’s modulus anisotropy, E||/E⊥~2.6, is unexpectedly lower than that measured by tensile testing, suggesting disparity between the local mesogenic orientation and the larger scale orientation of the network strands. Unprecedented is the robustness of E||/E⊥ to uniaxial load that it does not comply with continuously transformable director orientation observed in the tensile testing. Likewise, the heat conductivity is directional, κ||/κ⊥~3.0 with κ⊥ = 0.16 Wm−1K−1. Conceptually, this work reveals the different length scales involved in the thermoelastic anisotropy and provides insights for programming liquid crystal elastomers on-demand for high-frequency applications.","Elastic anisotropy of liquid crystals elastomers is typically measured at low frequencies for the applications such as soft robotics, actuators, and origami. Here the authors study the elastic anisotropy of LCE using Brillouin light spectroscopy at gigahertz frequencies such as radio frequencies or 5 G cellular networks.",2022-09-06
310,Extensive gut virome variation and its associations with host and environmental factors in a population-level cohort,"Indigenous bacteriophage communities (virome) in the human gut have a huge impact on the structure and function of gut bacterial communities (bacteriome), but virome variation at a population scale is not fully investigated yet. Here, we analyse the gut dsDNA virome in the Japanese 4D cohort of 4198 deeply phenotyped individuals. By assembling metagenomic reads, we discover thousands of high-quality phage genomes including previously uncharacterised phage clades with different bacterial hosts than known major ones. The distribution of host bacteria is a strong determinant for the distribution of phages in the gut, and virome diversity is highly correlated with anti-viral defence mechanisms of the bacteriome, such as CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification systems. We identify 97 various intrinsic/extrinsic factors that significantly affect the virome structure, including age, sex, lifestyle, and diet, most of which showed consistent associations with both phages and their predicted bacterial hosts. Among the metadata categories, disease and medication have the strongest effects on the virome structure. Overall, these results present a basis to understand the symbiotic communities of bacteria and their viruses in the human gut, which will facilitate the medical and industrial applications of indigenous viruses.","Here, Nishijima et al. perform a large-scale analysis of the human gut virome in the Japanese 4D cohort of 4198 deeply phenotyped individuals, revealing thousands of bacteriophage genomes, virus-bacteria interactions, and describing associations with various host and environmental factors.",2022-09-06
311,Ultrafast and hypersensitive phase imaging of propagating internodal current flows in myelinated axons and electromagnetic pulses in dielectrics,"Many ultrafast phenomena in biology and physics are fundamental to our scientific understanding but have not yet been visualized owing to the extreme speed and sensitivity requirements in imaging modalities. Two examples are the propagation of passive current flows through myelinated axons and electromagnetic pulses through dielectrics, which are both key to information processing in living organisms and electronic devices. Here, we demonstrate differentially enhanced compressed ultrafast photography (Diff-CUP) to directly visualize propagations of passive current flows at approximately 100 m/s along internodes, i.e., continuous myelinated axons between nodes of Ranvier, from Xenopus laevis sciatic nerves and of electromagnetic pulses at approximately 5 × 107 m/s through lithium niobate. The spatiotemporal dynamics of both propagation processes are consistent with the results from computational models, demonstrating that Diff-CUP can span these two extreme timescales while maintaining high phase sensitivity. With its ultrahigh speed (picosecond resolution), high sensitivity, and noninvasiveness, Diff-CUP provides a powerful tool for investigating ultrafast biological and physical phenomena.","The authors introduce differentially enhanced compressed ultrafast photography, a phase imaging platform that combines high speed and sensitivity. They visualise propagation of passive current flows along myelinated axons, and electromagnetic pulses in lithium niobate.",2022-09-06
312,"Neolithic culinary traditions revealed by cereal, milk and meat lipids in pottery from Scottish crannogs","Cereal cultivation in Britain dates back to ca. 4000 BCE, probably introduced by migrant farmers from continental Europe. Widespread evidence for livestock appears in the archaeozoological record, also reflected by ubiquitous dairy lipids in pottery organic residues. However, despite archaeobotanical evidence for domesticated plants (such as cereals), organic residue evidence has been near-absent. Our approach, targeting low-abundance cereal-specific markers, has now revealed evidence for cereals (indicating wheat) in Neolithic pottery from Scottish ‘crannogs’, dating to ca. 3600 – 3300 BCE. Their association with dairy products suggests cereals may have been regularly prepared together as a milk-based gruel. We also observed a strong association between the occurrence of dairy products and smaller-mouthed vessels. Here, we demonstrate that cereal-specific markers can survive in cooking pots for millennia, revealing the consumption of specific cereals (wheat) that are virtually absent from the archaeobotanical record for this region and illuminating culinary traditions among early farming communities.","Despite archaeobotanical evidence for domesticated cereals, organic residue evidence is scarce. Here, the authors identify cereal-specific markers in pottery from Scottish ‘crannogs’, revealing the presence of cereals in Neolithic pottery which might have been mixed with dairy products as a milk-based gruel.",2022-09-06
313,Ultrathin ferrite nanosheets for room-temperature two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors,"The discovery of magnetism in ultrathin crystals opens up opportunities to explore new physics and to develop next-generation spintronic devices. Nevertheless, two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors with Curie temperatures higher than room temperature have rarely been reported. Ferrites with strongly correlated d-orbital electrons may be alternative candidates offering two-dimensional high-temperature magnetic ordering. This prospect is, however, hindered by their inherent three-dimensional bonded nature. Here, we develop a confined-van der Waals epitaxial approach to synthesizing air-stable semiconducting cobalt ferrite nanosheets with thickness down to one unit cell using a facile chemical vapor deposition process. The hard magnetic behavior and magnetic domain evolution are demonstrated by means of vibrating sample magnetometry, magnetic force microscopy and magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, which shows high Curie temperature above 390 K and strong dimensionality effect. The addition of room-temperature magnetic semiconductors to two-dimensional material family provides possibilities for numerous novel applications in computing, sensing and information storage.","Van der Waals crystals allow for magnetism down to the monolayer limit, however, this magnetism, and frequently the material itself, is fragile. Ferrites, conversely, have robust material stability and magnetic order, but are three dimensional. Here the authors succeed in creating a single unit cell thickness of Cobalt Ferrite via chemical vapour deposition, with hard magnetic properties, and curie temperature exceeding room temperature.",2022-09-06
314,Parallel triplet formation pathways in a singlet fission material,"Harvesting long-lived free triplets in high yields by utilizing organic singlet fission materials can be the cornerstone for increasing photovoltaic efficiencies potentially. However, except for polyacenes, which are the most studied systems in the singlet fission field, spin-entangled correlated triplet pairs and free triplets born through singlet fission are relatively poorly characterized. By utilizing transient absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy in supramolecular aggregate thin films consisting of Hamilton-receptor-substituted diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives, we show that photoexcitation gives rise to the formation of spin-0 correlated triplet pair 1(TT) from the lower Frenkel exciton state. The existence of 1(TT) is proved through faint Herzberg-Teller emission that is enabled by vibronic coupling and correlated with an artifact-free triplet-state photoinduced absorption in the near-infrared. Surprisingly, transient electron paramagnetic resonance reveals that long-lived triplets are produced through classical intersystem crossing instead of 1(TT) dissociation, with the two pathways in competition. Moreover, comparison of the triplet-formation dynamics in J-like and H-like thin films with the same energetics reveals that spin-orbit coupling mediated intersystem crossing persists in both. However, 1(TT) only forms in the J-like film, pinpointing the huge impact of intermolecular coupling geometry on singlet fission dynamics.","The singlet fission mechanism is still not relatively well understood, except for polyacenes. Here, the authors demonstrate that in diketopyrrolopyrrole supramolecular assemblies, both singlet fission and intersystem crossing can simultaneously happen.",2022-09-06
315,PIM1 promotes hepatic conversion by suppressing reprogramming-induced ferroptosis and cell cycle arrest,"Protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation plays a critical role in many biological processes. However, the identification of key regulatory kinases is still a great challenge. Here, we develop a trans-omics-based method, central kinase inference, to predict potentially key kinases by integrating quantitative transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic data. Using known kinases associated with anti-cancer drug resistance, the accuracy of our method denoted by the area under the curve is 5.2% to 29.5% higher than Kinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis. We further use this method to analyze trans-omic data in hepatocyte maturation and hepatic reprogramming of human dermal fibroblasts, uncovering 5 kinases as regulators in the two processes. Further experiments reveal that a serine/threonine kinase, PIM1, promotes hepatic conversion and protects human dermal fibroblasts from reprogramming-induced ferroptosis and cell cycle arrest. This study not only reveals new regulatory kinases, but also provides a helpful method that might be extended to predict central kinases involved in other biological processes.","Protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation plays a critical role in many biological processes. Here the authors develop a trans-omics-based algorithm called Central Kinase Inference to integrate quantitative transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic data, finding that PIM1 promotes hepatic conversion by suppressing reprogramming-induced ferroptosis and cell cycle arrest.",2022-09-06
316,Molecular insights into antibody-mediated protection against the prototypic simian immunodeficiency virus,"SIVmac239 infection of macaques is a favored model of human HIV infection. However, the SIVmac239 envelope (Env) trimer structure, glycan occupancy, and the targets and ability of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to protect against SIVmac239 remain unknown. Here, we report the isolation of SIVmac239 nAbs that recognize a glycan hole and the V1/V4 loop. A high-resolution structure of a SIVmac239 Env trimer-nAb complex shows many similarities to HIV and SIVcpz Envs, but with distinct V4 features and an extended V1 loop. Moreover, SIVmac239 Env has a higher glycan shield density than HIV Env that may contribute to poor or delayed nAb responses in SIVmac239-infected macaques. Passive transfer of a nAb protects macaques from repeated intravenous SIVmac239 challenge at serum titers comparable to those described for protection of humans against HIV infection. Our results provide structural insights for vaccine design and shed light on antibody-mediated protection in the SIV model.","SIVmac239 infection of macaques is a favored model of human HIV infection, but antibody-mediated protection for SIVmac239 is insufficiently understood. Here, Zhao and Berndsen et al isolated nAbs and confirmed protection against SIVmac239 infection in passive transfer studies in macaques. The nAb was used to provide the first high-resolution structure of a rhesus SIV trimer by CryoEM. Analysis of the glycosylation pattern of this SIV trimer suggests a denser glycan shield on Env for rhesus SIV compared to chimpanzee SIV or HIV-1, which partially explains the poor nAb response of rhesus macaques to SIVmac239 infection.",2022-09-06
317,Multistability and anomalies in oscillator models of lossy power grids,"The analysis of dissipatively coupled oscillators is challenging and highly relevant in power grids. Standard mathematical methods are not applicable, due to the lack of network symmetry induced by dissipative couplings. Here we demonstrate a close correspondence between stable synchronous states in dissipatively coupled oscillators, and the winding partition of their state space, a geometric notion induced by the network topology. Leveraging this winding partition, we accompany this article with an algorithms to compute all synchronous solutions of complex networks of dissipatively coupled oscillators. These geometric and computational tools allow us to identify anomalous behaviors of lossy networked systems. Counterintuitively, we show that loop flows and dissipation can increase the system’s transfer capacity, and that dissipation can promote multistability. We apply our geometric framework to compute power flows on the IEEE RTS-96 test system, where we identify two high voltage solutions with distinct loop flows.","Dissipatively coupled oscillators, describing lossy flows in power grids, are challenging to analyze due to asymmetry of couplings. Here, Delabays et al. reveal counterintuitive behaviours of increased capacity and increased stability in a network of lossy oscillators.",2022-09-06
318,Lactate increases stemness of CD8 + T cells to augment anti-tumor immunity,"Lactate is a key metabolite produced from glycolytic metabolism of glucose molecules, yet it also serves as a primary carbon fuel source for many cell types. In the tumor-immune microenvironment, effect of lactate on cancer and immune cells can be highly complex and hard to decipher, which is further confounded by acidic protons, a co-product of glycolysis. Here we show that lactate is able to increase stemness of CD8+ T cells and augments anti-tumor immunity. Subcutaneous administration of sodium lactate but not glucose to mice bearing transplanted MC38 tumors results in CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor growth inhibition. Single cell transcriptomics analysis reveals increased proportion of stem-like TCF-1-expressing CD8+ T cells among intra-tumoral CD3+ cells, a phenotype validated by in vitro lactate treatment of T cells. Mechanistically, lactate inhibits histone deacetylase activity, which results in increased acetylation at H3K27 of the Tcf7 super enhancer locus, leading to increased Tcf7 gene expression. CD8+ T cells in vitro pre-treated with lactate efficiently inhibit tumor growth upon adoptive transfer to tumor-bearing mice. Our results provide evidence for an intrinsic role of lactate in anti-tumor immunity independent of the pH-dependent effect of lactic acid, and might advance cancer immune therapy.","Lactic acid from glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells has been associated with immune suppressive functions. Here authors show that lactate, when depart from the acidic protons, inhibits histone deacetylases in CD8 + T cells, which turns them into potent anti-tumour immune cells.",2022-09-06
319,Accounting for small variations in the tracrRNA sequence improves sgRNA activity predictions for CRISPR screening,"CRISPR technology is a powerful tool for studying genome function. To aid in picking sgRNAs that have maximal efficacy against a target of interest from many possible options, several groups have developed models that predict sgRNA on-target activity. Although multiple tracrRNA variants are commonly used for screening, no existing models account for this feature when nominating sgRNAs. Here we develop an on-target model, Rule Set 3, that makes optimal predictions for multiple tracrRNA variants. We validate Rule Set 3 on a new dataset of sgRNAs tiling essential and non-essential genes, demonstrating substantial improvement over prior prediction models. By analyzing the differences in sgRNA activity between tracrRNA variants, we show that Pol III transcription termination is a strong determinant of sgRNA activity. We expect these results to improve the performance of CRISPR screening and inform future research on tracrRNA engineering and sgRNA modeling.","Existing methods for generating sgRNA predictions do not account for the tracrRNA sequence. Here the authors report an on-target model, Rule Set 3, to generate optimal predictions for multiple tracrRNA variants, and validate this on a new dataset of sgRNAs showing improvement over prior prediction models.",2022-09-06
320,Changes in limiting factors for forager population dynamics in Europe across the last glacial-interglacial transition,"Population dynamics set the framework for human genetic and cultural evolution. For foragers, demographic and environmental changes correlate strongly, although the causal relations between different environmental variables and human responses through time and space likely varied. Building on the notion of limiting factors, namely that at any one time, the scarcest resource caps population size, we present a statistical approach to identify the dominant climatic constraints for hunter-gatherer population densities and then hindcast their changing dynamics in Europe for the period between 21,000 to 8000 years ago. Limiting factors shifted from temperature-related variables (effective temperature) during the Pleistocene to a regional mosaic of limiting factors in the Holocene dominated by temperature seasonality and annual precipitation. This spatiotemporal variation suggests that hunter-gatherers needed to overcome very different adaptive challenges in different parts of Europe and that these challenges varied over time. The signatures of these changing adaptations may be visible archaeologically. In addition, the spatial disaggregation of limiting factors from the Pleistocene to the Holocene coincided with and may partly explain the diversification of the cultural geography at this time.","Here, the authors use climate and resource availability, to statistically model the limiting factors in the dynamics of hunter-gatherer population densities in Europe between 21,000 and 8,000 years ago. They find that limiting factors varied spatiotemporally and the effects of these may be visible in the archaeological record.",2022-09-06
321,MVsim is a toolset for quantifying and designing multivalent interactions,"Arising through multiple binding elements, multivalency can specify the avidity, duration, cooperativity, and selectivity of biomolecular interactions, but quantitative prediction and design of these properties has remained challenging. Here we present MVsim, an application suite built around a configurational network model of multivalency to facilitate the quantification, design, and mechanistic evaluation of multivalent binding phenomena through a simple graphical user interface. To demonstrate the utility and versatility of MVsim, we first show that both monospecific and multispecific multivalent ligand-receptor interactions, with their noncanonical binding kinetics, can be accurately simulated. Further, to illustrate the conceptual insights into multivalent systems that MVsim can provide, we apply it to quantitatively predict the ultrasensitivity and performance of multivalent-encoded protein logic gates, evaluate the inherent programmability of multispecificity for selective receptor targeting, and extract rate constants of conformational switching for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and model its binding to ACE2 as well as multivalent inhibitors of this interaction. MVsim and instructional tutorials are freely available at https://sarkarlab.github.io/MVsim/.","Arising through multiple binding elements, multivalency can specify the avidity, duration, cooperativity, and selectivity of biomolecular interactions, but quantitative prediction and design of these properties has remained challenging.

322,Signal processing and generation of bioactive nitric oxide in a model prototissue,"The design and construction of synthetic prototissues from integrated assemblies of artificial protocells is an important challenge for synthetic biology and bioengineering. Here we spatially segregate chemically communicating populations of enzyme-decorated phospholipid-enveloped polymer/DNA coacervate protocells in hydrogel modules to construct a tubular prototissue-like vessel capable of modulating the output of bioactive nitric oxide (NO). By decorating the protocells with glucose oxidase, horseradish peroxidase or catalase and arranging different modules concentrically, a glucose/hydroxyurea dual input leads to logic-gate signal processing under reaction-diffusion conditions, which results in a distinct NO output in the internal lumen of the model prototissue. The NO output is exploited to inhibit platelet activation and blood clot formation in samples of plasma and whole blood located in the internal channel of the device, thereby demonstrating proof-of-concept use of the prototissue-like vessel for anticoagulation applications. Our results highlight opportunities for the development of spatially organized synthetic prototissue modules from assemblages of artificial protocells and provide a step towards the organization of biochemical processes in integrated micro-compartmentalized media, micro-reactor technology and soft functional materials.","A challenge for synthetic biology is the design and construction of prototissue.

323,The mutational signatures of formalin fixation on the human genome,"Clinical archives of patient material near-exclusively consist of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks. The ability to precisely characterise mutational signatures from FFPE-derived DNA has tremendous translational potential. However, sequencing of DNA derived from FFPE material is known to be riddled with artefacts. Here we derive genome-wide mutational signatures caused by formalin fixation. We show that the FFPE-signature is highly similar to signature 30 (the signature of Base Excision Repair deficiency due to NTHL1 mutations), and chemical repair of DNA lesions leads to a signature highly similar to signature 1 (clock-like signature due to spontaneous deamination of methylcytosine). We demonstrate that using uncorrected mutational catalogues of FFPE samples leads to major mis-assignment of signature activities. To correct for this, we introduce FFPEsig, a computational algorithm to rectify the formalin-induced artefacts in the mutational catalogue. We demonstrate that FFPEsig enables accurate mutational signature analysis both in simulated and whole-genome sequenced FFPE cancer samples. FFPEsig thus provides an opportunity to unlock additional clinical potential of archival patient tissues.","Many archived tumour samples are stored as formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, but this treatment can impact downstream genomics analyses. Here, the authors derive the mutational signatures of formalin on the cancer genome, and present FFPEsig, an algorithm that can distinguish and correct FFPE mutational signatures in archived cancer samples.",2022-09-06
324,Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants on a university campus,"Novel variants continue to emerge in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. University testing programs may provide timely epidemiologic and genomic surveillance data to inform public health responses. We conducted testing from September 2021 to February 2022 in a university population under vaccination and indoor mask mandates. A total of 3,048 of 24,393 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR; whole genome sequencing identified 209 Delta and 1,730 Omicron genomes of the 1,939 total sequenced. Compared to Delta, Omicron had a shorter median serial interval between genetically identical, symptomatic infections within households (2 versus 6 days, P = 0.021). Omicron also demonstrated a greater peak reproductive number (2.4 versus 1.8), and a 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 0.58, 1.57; P < 0.0001) higher mean cycle threshold value. Despite near universal vaccination and stringent mitigation measures, Omicron rapidly displaced the Delta variant to become the predominant viral strain and led to a surge in cases in a university population.","This study presents results from a SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance study at a university campus in which ~2,000 samples were sequenced over five months.

Here, investigate HLA-A*24:02-restricted CD8+ T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2-derived spike (S) epitopes in individuals immunized with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. T cells specific for the S-QI9 and S-NF9 immunodominant epitopes have higher ability to recognize epitopes than other epitope-specific T cell populations. This higher recognition of S-QI9-specific T cells is due to the high stability of the S-QI9 peptide for HLA-A*24:02, whereas that of S-NF9-specific T cells results from the high affinity of T cell receptor. T cells specific for S-QI9 and S-NF9 are detectable >30 weeks after the second vaccination, indicating that the vaccine induces long-term memory T cells specific for these epitopes. Because the S-QI9 epitope is highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2 variants, S-QI9-specific T cells may help prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants.","mRNA vaccines have been shown to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce hospitalization and mortality rates. Here, the authors show evidence of long-term memory CD8 + T cells in individuals who received the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.",2022-09-06
326,The human thalamus orchestrates neocortical oscillations during NREM sleep,"A hallmark of non-rapid eye movement sleep is the coordinated interplay of slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles. Traditionally, a cortico-thalamo-cortical loop is suggested to coordinate these rhythms: neocortically-generated SOs trigger spindles in the thalamus that are projected back to neocortex. Here, we used intrathalamic recordings from human epilepsy patients to test this canonical interplay. We show that SOs in the anterior thalamus precede neocortical SOs (peak −50 ms), whereas concurrently-recorded SOs in the mediodorsal thalamus are led by neocortical SOs (peak +50 ms). Sleep spindles, detected in both thalamic nuclei, preceded their neocortical counterparts (peak −100 ms) and were initiated during early phases of thalamic SOs. Our findings indicate an active role of the anterior thalamus in organizing sleep rhythms in the neocortex and highlight the functional diversity of thalamic nuclei in humans. The thalamic coordination of sleep oscillations could have broad implications for the mechanisms underlying memory consolidation.","Slow oscillations, which are instrumental to memory consolidation, have been assumed to be solely generated in neocortex. Here, the authors show that the anterior thalamus might play a fundamental role in organizing slow oscillations in human sleep.",2022-09-05
327,Distinct ankyrin repeat subdomains control VAPYRIN locations and intracellular accommodation functions during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis,"Over 70% of vascular flowering plants engage in endosymbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. VAPYRIN (VPY) is a plant protein that is required for intracellular accommodation of AM fungi but how it functions is still unclear. VPY has a large ankyrin repeat domain with potential for interactions with multiple proteins. Here we show that overexpression of the ankyrin repeat domain results in a vpy-like phenotype, consistent with the sequestration of interacting proteins. We identify distinct ankyrin repeats that are essential for intracellular accommodation of arbuscules and reveal that VPY functions in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. VPY interacts with two kinases, including DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS3 (DMI3), a nuclear-localized symbiosis signaling kinase. Overexpression of VPY in a symbiosis-attenuated genetic background results in a dmi3 -like phenotype suggesting that VPY negatively influences DMI3 function. Overall, the data indicate a requirement for VPY in the nucleus and cytoplasm where it may coordinate signaling and cellular accommodation processes.",VAPYRIN is a plant protein required for symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Here the authors identify VAPYRIN domains that control subcellular targeting and protein-protein interactions and propose that VAPYRIN acts in the nucleus and cytoplasm to coordinate signaling and intracellular arbuscule accommodation.,2022-09-05
328,A Cryptochrome adopts distinct moon- and sunlight states and functions as sun- versus moonlight interpreter in monthly oscillator entrainment,"The moon’s monthly cycle synchronizes reproduction in countless marine organisms. The mass-spawning bristle worm Platynereis dumerilii uses an endogenous monthly oscillator set by full moon to phase reproduction to specific days. But how do organisms recognize specific moon phases? We uncover that the light receptor L-Cryptochrome (L-Cry) discriminates between different moonlight durations, as well as between sun- and moonlight. A biochemical characterization of purified L-Cry protein, exposed to naturalistic sun- or moonlight, reveals the formation of distinct sun- and moonlight states characterized by different photoreduction- and recovery kinetics of L-Cry’s co-factor Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide. In Platynereis, L-Cry’s sun- versus moonlight states correlate with distinct subcellular localizations, indicating different signaling. In contrast, r-Opsin1, the most abundant ocular opsin, is not required for monthly oscillator entrainment. Our work reveals a photo-ecological concept for natural light interpretation involving a “valence interpreter” that provides entraining photoreceptor(s) with light source and moon phase information.","Reproduction in numerous marine organisms is timed to specific moon phases, but the mechanisms for sensing moon phases are incompletely understood. Here the authors report that an ancient, light-sensitive protein L-Cryptochrome in a marine bristle worm can discriminate between sun- and moonlight, enabling the animals to properly decode moon phases.",2022-09-05
329,O-GlcNAcylation enhances CPS1 catalytic efficiency for ammonia and promotes ureagenesis,"Life-threatening hyperammonemia occurs in both inherited and acquired liver diseases affecting ureagenesis, the main pathway for detoxification of neurotoxic ammonia in mammals. Protein O-GlcNAcylation is a reversible and nutrient-sensitive post-translational modification using as substrate UDP-GlcNAc, the end-product of hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. Here we show that increased liver UDP-GlcNAc during hyperammonemia increases protein O-GlcNAcylation and enhances ureagenesis. Mechanistically, O-GlcNAcylation on specific threonine residues increased the catalytic efficiency for ammonia of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), the rate-limiting enzyme in ureagenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of O-GlcNAcase, the enzyme removing O-GlcNAc from proteins, resulted in clinically relevant reductions of systemic ammonia in both genetic (hypomorphic mouse model of propionic acidemia) and acquired (thioacetamide-induced acute liver failure) mouse models of liver diseases. In conclusion, by fine-tuned control of ammonia entry into ureagenesis, hepatic O-GlcNAcylation of CPS1 increases ammonia detoxification and is a novel target for therapy of hyperammonemia in both genetic and acquired diseases.","Hyperammonemia occurs in liver diseases affecting ureagenesis, and is life-threatening. Here, the authors show that liver UDP-GlcNAc is increased during hyperammonemia, leading to O-GlcNAcylation of the rate-limiting ureagenesis enzyme CPS1, that enhanced ureagenesis and ammonia detoxification. They also showed that pharmacological increase of protein O-GlcNAcylation reduces hyperammonemia in mouse models of liver disease.",2022-09-05
330,Adipocyte-derived lactate is a signalling metabolite that potentiates adipose macrophage inflammation via targeting PHD2,"Adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) inflammation is involved with meta-inflammation and pathology of metabolic complications. Here we report that in adipocytes, elevated lactate production, previously regarded as the waste product of glycolysis, serves as a danger signal to promote ATM polarization to an inflammatory state in the context of obesity. Adipocyte-selective deletion of lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha), the enzyme converting pyruvate to lactate, protects mice from obesity-associated glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, accompanied by a lower percentage of inflammatory ATM and reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β). Mechanistically, lactate, at its physiological concentration, fosters the activation of inflammatory macrophages by directly binding to the catalytic domain of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing 2 (PHD2) in a competitive manner with α-ketoglutarate and stabilizes hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α). Lactate-induced IL-1β was abolished in PHD2-deficient macrophages. Human adipose lactate level is positively linked with local inflammatory features and insulin resistance index independent of the body mass index (BMI). Our study shows a critical function of adipocyte-derived lactate in promoting the pro-inflammatory microenvironment in adipose and identifies PHD2 as a direct sensor of lactate, which functions to connect chronic inflammation and energy metabolism.",Adipocyte tissue macrophages (ATM) are recruited and activated in obesity. The authors show that adipocytes release lactate as a signal of inflammation and that this metabolite can enhance obesity associated inflammation through stimulation of ATM by direct binding with PHD2.,2022-09-05
331,Spin-selected electron transfer in liquid–solid contact electrification,"Electron transfer has been proven the dominant charge carrier during contact electrification at the liquid–solid interface. However, the effect of electron spin in contact electrification remains to be investigated. This study examines the charge transfer between different liquids and ferrimagnetic solids in a magnetic field, focusing on the contribution of O2 molecules to the liquid–solid contact electrification. The findings reveal that magnetic fields promote electron transfer at the O2-containing liquid–solid interfaces. Moreover, magnetic field-induced electron transfer increases at higher O2 concentrations in the liquids and decreases at elevated temperatures. The results indicate spin-selected electron transfer at liquid–solid interface. External magnetic fields can modulate the spin conversion of the radical pairs at the O2-containing liquid and ferrimagnetic solid interfaces due to the Zeeman interaction, promoting electron transfer. A spin-selected electron transfer model for liquid–solid contact electrification is further proposed based on the radical pair mechanism, in which the HO2 molecules and the free unpaired electrons from the ferrimagnetic solids are considered radical pairs. The spin conversion of the [HO2• •e−] pairs is affected by magnetic fields, rendering the electron transfer magnetic field-sensitive.","Electron transfer has been shown to contribute to contact electrification at liquid–solid interface. Here, authors investigate the magnetic field effect on the liquid–solid electron transfer and propose a spin conversion model for the liquid–solid contact electrification.",2022-09-05
332,Allosteric inhibition of HTRA1 activity by a conformational lock mechanism to treat age-related macular degeneration,"The trimeric serine protease HTRA1 is a genetic risk factor associated with geographic atrophy (GA), a currently untreatable form of age-related macular degeneration. Here, we describe the allosteric inhibition mechanism of HTRA1 by a clinical Fab fragment, currently being evaluated for GA treatment. Using cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays we identify the exposed LoopA of HTRA1 as the sole Fab epitope, which is approximately 30 Å away from the active site. The cryo-EM structure of the HTRA1:Fab complex in combination with molecular dynamics simulations revealed that Fab binding to LoopA locks HTRA1 in a non-competent conformational state, incapable of supporting catalysis. Moreover, grafting the HTRA1-LoopA epitope onto HTRA2 and HTRA3 transferred the allosteric inhibition mechanism. This suggests a conserved conformational lock mechanism across the HTRA family and a critical role of LoopA for catalysis, which was supported by the reduced activity of HTRA1-3 upon LoopA deletion or perturbation. This study reveals the long-range inhibition mechanism of the clinical Fab and identifies an essential function of the exposed LoopA for activity of HTRA family proteases.","The protease HTRA1 is a genetic risk factor for geographic atrophy. Here, Gerhardy et al. describe its inhibition by a clinical Fab, whose binding locks it in an inactive state. The mechanism identifies an essential function of LoopA with this protease family.",2022-09-05
333,High-density electrode recordings reveal strong and specific connections between retinal ganglion cells and midbrain neurons,"The superior colliculus is a midbrain structure that plays important roles in visually guided behaviors in mammals. Neurons in the superior colliculus receive inputs from retinal ganglion cells but how these inputs are integrated in vivo is unknown. Here, we discovered that high-density electrodes simultaneously capture the activity of retinal axons and their postsynaptic target neurons in the superior colliculus, in vivo. We show that retinal ganglion cell axons in the mouse provide a single cell precise representation of the retina as input to superior colliculus. This isomorphic mapping builds the scaffold for precise retinotopic wiring and functionally specific connection strength. Our methods are broadly applicable, which we demonstrate by recording retinal inputs in the optic tectum in zebra finches. We find common wiring rules in mice and zebra finches that provide a precise representation of the visual world encoded in retinal ganglion cells connections to neurons in retinorecipient areas.","The superior colliculus receives visual information from retinal ganglion cells, but it remains unclear how this information is organized and integrated in vivo. Here the authors describe how high-density electrodes can simultaneously capture the activity of incoming axons and target neurons in the superior colliculus, and demonstrate isomorphic mapping and strong and specific connections in mice and zebrafinches.",2022-09-05
334,Reversible electrical percolation in a stretchable and self-healable silver-gradient nanocomposite bilayer,"The reversibly stable formation and rupture processes of electrical percolative pathways in organic and inorganic insulating materials are essential prerequisites for operating non-volatile resistive memory devices. However, such resistive switching has not yet been reported for dynamically cross-linked polymers capable of intrinsic stretchability and self-healing. This is attributable to the uncontrollable interplay between the conducting filler and the polymer. Herein, we present the development of the self-healing, stretchable, and reconfigurable resistive random-access memory. The device was fabricated via the self-assembly of a silver-gradient nanocomposite bilayer which is capable of easily forming the metal-insulator-metal structure. To realize stable resistive switching in dynamic molecular networks, our device features the following properties: i) self-reconstruction of nanoscale conducting fillers in dynamic hydrogen bonding for self-healing and reconfiguration and ii) stronger interaction among the conducting fillers than with polymers for the formation of robust percolation paths. Based on these unique features, we successfully demonstrated stable data storage of cardiac signals, damage-reliable memory triggering system using a triboelectric energy-harvesting device, and touch sensing via pressure-induced resistive switching.","Smart healthcare devices, which interacts with the human body by recording, analyzing and processing physiological signals, need soft and biocompatible electronics. Here, Son et al. report a self-healable and stretchable resistive switching random-access memory made of a Ag-gradient nanocomposite.",2022-09-05
335,Structural basis for recognition of N-formyl peptides as pathogen-associated molecular patterns,"The formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) is primarily responsible for detection of short peptides bearing N-formylated methionine (fMet) that are characteristic of protein synthesis in bacteria and mitochondria. As a result, FPR1 is critical to phagocyte migration and activation in bacterial infection, tissue injury and inflammation. How FPR1 distinguishes between formyl peptides and non-formyl peptides remains elusive. Here we report cryo-EM structures of human FPR1-Gi protein complex bound to S. aureus-derived peptide fMet-Ile-Phe-Leu (fMIFL) and E. coli-derived peptide fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLF). Both structures of FPR1 adopt an active conformation and exhibit a binding pocket containing the R2015.38XXXR2055.42 (RGIIR) motif for formyl group interaction and receptor activation. This motif works together with D1063.33 for hydrogen bond formation with the N-formyl group and with fMet, a model supported by MD simulation and functional assays of mutant receptors with key residues for recognition substituted by alanine. The cryo-EM model of agonist-bound FPR1 provides a structural basis for recognition of bacteria-derived chemotactic peptides with potential applications in developing FPR1-targeting agents.","Detection of invading bacteria is key to immunity. Here, the authors report cryo-electron microscopy structures of agonist-bound formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), that reveal structural basis for recognition of bacteria-derived formyl peptides.",2022-09-05
336,Small-molecule ionic liquid-based adhesive with strong room-temperature adhesion promoted by electrostatic interaction,"Low-molecular-weight adhesives (LMWAs) possess many unique features compared to polymer adhesives. However, fabricating LMWAs with adhesion strengths higher than those of polymeric materials is a significant challenge, mainly because of the relatively weak and unbalanced cohesion and interfacial adhesion. Herein, an ionic liquid (IL)-based adhesive with high adhesion strength is demonstrated by introducing an IL moiety into a Y-shaped molecule replete with hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) interactions. The IL moieties not only destroyed the rigid and ordered H-bonding networks, releasing more free groups to form hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) at the substrate/adhesive interface, but also provided electrostatic interactions that improved the cohesion energy. The synthesized IL-based adhesive, Tri-HT, could directly form thin coatings on various substrates, with high adhesion strengths of up to 12.20 MPa. Advanced adhesives with electrical conductivity, self-healing behavior, and electrically-controlled adhesion could also be fabricated by combining Tri-HT with carbon nanotubes.","Low-molecular-weight adhesives (LMWAs) possess many unique features compared to polymer adhesives but fabrication of LMWAs with adhesion strengths higher exceeding those of polymeric materials is a significant challenge. Here, the authors propose an ionic liquid based thin coating adhesive with high adhesion strength.",2022-09-05
337,MTG8 interacts with LHX6 to specify cortical interneuron subtype identity,"Cortical interneurons originating in the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) diverge into a range of different subtypes found in the adult mouse cerebral cortex. The mechanisms underlying this divergence and the timing when subtype identity is set up remain unclear. We identify the highly conserved transcriptional co-factor MTG8 as being pivotal in the development of a large subset of MGE cortical interneurons that co-expresses Somatostatin (SST) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY). MTG8 interacts with the pan-MGE transcription factor LHX6 and together the two factors are sufficient to promote expression of critical cortical interneuron subtype identity genes. The SST-NPY cortical interneuron fate is initiated early, well before interneurons migrate into the cortex, demonstrating an early onset specification program. Our findings suggest that transcriptional co-factors and modifiers of generic lineage specification programs may hold the key to the emergence of cortical interneuron heterogeneity from the embryonic telencephalic germinal zones.","There is a large diversity of inhibitory interneurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex. How this emerges during embryogenesis remains unclear. Here, the authors identify MTG8 as a co-factor of LHX6 and a new regulator of cortical interneuron development.",2022-09-05
338,Spatiotemporal dynamics of self-organized branching in pancreas-derived organoids,"The development dynamics and self-organization of glandular branched epithelia is of utmost importance for our understanding of diverse processes ranging from normal tissue growth to the growth of cancerous tissues. Using single primary murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells embedded in a collagen matrix and adapted media supplementation, we generate organoids that self-organize into highly branched structures displaying a seamless lumen connecting terminal end buds, replicating in vivo PDAC architecture. We identify distinct morphogenesis phases, each characterized by a unique pattern of cell invasion, matrix deformation, protein expression, and respective molecular dependencies. We propose a minimal theoretical model of a branching and proliferating tissue, capturing the dynamics of the first phases. Observing the interaction of morphogenesis, mechanical environment and gene expression in vitro sets a benchmark for the understanding of self-organization processes governing complex organoid structure formation processes and branching morphogenesis.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) exhibit complex morphologies challenging to capture in organoid models. Here, the authors develop PDAC organoids that can recreate branched structures and, with the use of a minimal mathematical model, shed light to pathways and processes directing the dynamics of self-organization and branching morphogenesis.",2022-09-05
339,HIF-1 stabilization in T cells hampers the control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection,"The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) regulate the main transcriptional pathway of response to hypoxia in T cells and are negatively regulated by von Hippel-Lindau factor (VHL). But the role of HIFs in the regulation of CD4 T cell responses during infection with M. tuberculosis isn’t well understood. Here we show that mice lacking VHL in T cells (Vhl cKO) are highly susceptible to infection with M. tuberculosis, which is associated with a low accumulation of mycobacteria-specific T cells in the lungs that display reduced proliferation, altered differentiation and enhanced expression of inhibitory receptors. In contrast, HIF-1 deficiency in T cells is redundant for M. tuberculosis control. Vhl cKO mice also show reduced responses to vaccination. Further, VHL promotes proper MYC-activation, cell-growth responses, DNA synthesis, proliferation and survival of CD4 T cells after TCR activation. The VHL-deficient T cell responses are rescued by the loss of HIF-1α, indicating that the increased susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection and the impaired responses of Vhl-deficient T cells are HIF-1-dependent.","The role of hypoxia inducible factors in infection and immune response is unclear. Here, the authors study their impact on the regulation of T cells responses during Mycobacteria tuberculosis infection using transcriptomics, flow cytometry and in vivo infection.",2022-09-05
340,Neuromorphic device based on silicon nanosheets,"Silicon is vital for its high abundance, vast production, and perfect compatibility with the well-established CMOS processing industry. Recently, artificially stacked layered 2D structures have gained tremendous attention via fine-tuning properties for electronic devices. This article presents neuromorphic devices based on silicon nanosheets that are chemically exfoliated and surface-modified, enabling self-assembly into hierarchical stacking structures. The device functionality can be switched between a unipolar memristor and a feasibly reset-able synaptic device. The memory function of the device is based on the charge storage in the partially oxidized SiNS stacks followed by the discharge activated by the electric field at the Au-Si Schottky interface, as verified in both experimental and theoretical means. This work further inspired elegant neuromorphic computation models for digit recognition and noise filtration. Ultimately, it brings silicon - the most established semiconductor - back to the forefront for next-generation computations.","Silicon is an abundant element on earth and is perfectly compatible with the well-established CMOS processing industry. Here, Sun et al. demonstrate multifunctional neuromorphic devices based on silicon nanosheet stacks, bringing silicon back as a potential material for neuromorphic devices.",2022-09-05
341,Molecular basis for polysaccharide recognition and modulated ATP hydrolysis by the O antigen ABC transporter,"O antigens are ubiquitous protective extensions of lipopolysaccharides in the extracellular leaflet of the Gram-negative outer membrane. Following biosynthesis in the cytosol, the lipid-linked polysaccharide is transported to the periplasm by the WzmWzt ABC transporter. Often, O antigen secretion requires the chemical modification of its elongating terminus, which the transporter recognizes via a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD). Here, using components from A. aeolicus, we identify the O antigen structure with methylated mannose or rhamnose as its cap. Crystal and cryo electron microscopy structures reveal how WzmWzt recognizes this cap between its carbohydrate and nucleotide-binding domains in a nucleotide-free state. ATP binding induces drastic conformational changes of its CBD, terminating interactions with the O antigen. ATPase assays and site directed mutagenesis reveal reduced hydrolytic activity upon O antigen binding, likely to facilitate polymer loading into the ABC transporter. Our results elucidate critical steps in the recognition and translocation of polysaccharides by ABC transporters.","Gram negative microbes strategically equip lipopolysaccharides with O antigens to expand the extracellular envelope. Here, the authors examine how the O antigen is captured by a special class of ABC transporters containing a carbohydrate-binding module accessory.",2022-09-05
342,Augmented tactile-perception and haptic-feedback rings as human-machine interfaces aiming for immersive interactions,"Advancements of virtual reality technology pave the way for developing wearable devices to enable somatosensory sensation, which can bring more comprehensive perception and feedback in the metaverse-based virtual society. Here, we propose augmented tactile-perception and haptic-feedback rings with multimodal sensing and feedback capabilities. This highly integrated ring consists of triboelectric and pyroelectric sensors for tactile and temperature perception, and vibrators and nichrome heaters for vibro- and thermo-haptic feedback. All these components integrated on the ring can be directly driven by a custom wireless platform of low power consumption for wearable/portable scenarios. With voltage integration processing, high-resolution continuous finger motion tracking is achieved via the triboelectric tactile sensor, which also contributes to superior performance in gesture/object recognition with artificial intelligence analysis. By fusing the multimodal sensing and feedback functions, an interactive metaverse platform with cross-space perception capability is successfully achieved, giving people a face-to-face like immersive virtual social experience.","Current wearable solutions for Virtual Reality (VR) have limitations of complicated structures and large driven power.

343,Msx1+ stem cells recruited by bioactive tissue engineering graft for bone regeneration,"Critical-sized bone defects often lead to non-union and full-thickness defects of the calvarium specifically still present reconstructive challenges. In this study, we show that neurotrophic supplements induce robust in vitro expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells, and in situ transplantation of neurotrophic supplements-incorporated 3D-printed hydrogel grafts promote full-thickness regeneration of critical-sized bone defects. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that a unique atlas of in situ stem/progenitor cells is generated during the calvarial bone healing in vivo. Notably, we find a local expansion of resident Msx1+ skeletal stem cells after transplantation of the in situ cell culture system. Moreover, the enhanced calvarial bone regeneration is accompanied by an increased endochondral ossification that closely correlates to the Msx1+ skeletal stem cells. Our findings illustrate the time-saving and regenerative efficacy of in situ cell culture systems targeting major cell subpopulations in vivo for rapid bone tissue regeneration.","Critical-sized bone defects still present clinical challenges.

344,Structure and activity of particulate methane monooxygenase arrays in methanotrophs,"Methane-oxidizing bacteria play a central role in greenhouse gas mitigation and have potential applications in biomanufacturing. Their primary metabolic enzyme, particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), is housed in copper-induced intracytoplasmic membranes (ICMs), of which the function and biogenesis are not known. We show by serial cryo-focused ion beam (cryoFIB) milling/scanning electron microscope (SEM) volume imaging and lamellae-based cellular cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) that these ICMs are derived from the inner cell membrane. The pMMO trimer, resolved by cryoET and subtomogram averaging to 4.8 Å in the ICM, forms higher-order hexagonal arrays in intact cells. Array formation correlates with increased enzymatic activity, highlighting the importance of studying the enzyme in its native environment. These findings also demonstrate the power of cryoET to structurally characterize native membrane enzymes in the cellular context.","Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) is the main enzyme used by methanotrophs.

345,In-sensor image memorization and encoding via optical neurons for bio-stimulus domain reduction toward visual cognitive processing,"As machine vision technology generates large amounts of data from sensors, it requires efficient computational systems for visual cognitive processing. Recently, in-sensor computing systems have emerged as a potential solution for reducing unnecessary data transfer and realizing fast and energy-efficient visual cognitive processing. However, they still lack the capability to process stored images directly within the sensor. Here, we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated 1-photodiode and 1 memristor (1P-1R) crossbar for in-sensor visual cognitive processing, emulating a mammalian image encoding process to extract features from the input images. Unlike other neuromorphic vision processes, the trained weight values are applied as an input voltage to the image-saved crossbar array instead of storing the weight value in the memristors, realizing the in-sensor computing paradigm. We believe the heterogeneously integrated in-sensor computing platform provides an advanced architecture for real-time and data-intensive machine-vision applications via bio-stimulus domain reduction.","Designing in-sensor computing systems remains a challenge. Here, the authors demonstrate artificial optical neurons based on the in-sensor computing architecture that fuses sensory and computing nodes into a single platform capable of reducing data transfer time and energy for encoding and classification.",2022-09-05
346,NETosis and thrombosis in vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare yet serious adverse effect of the adenoviral vector vaccines ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) against COVID-19. The mechanisms involved in clot formation and thrombocytopenia in VITT are yet to be fully determined. Here we show neutrophils undergoing NETosis and confirm expression markers of NETs in VITT patients. VITT antibodies directly stimulate neutrophils to release NETs and induce thrombus formation containing abundant platelets, neutrophils, fibrin, extracellular DNA and citrullinated histone H3 in a flow microfluidics system and in vivo. Inhibition of NETosis prevents VITT-induced thrombosis in mice but not thrombocytopenia. In contrast, in vivo blockage of FcγRIIa abrogates both thrombosis and thrombocytopenia suggesting these are distinct processes. Our findings indicate that anti-PF4 antibodies activate blood cells via FcγRIIa and are responsible for thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in VITT. Future development of NETosis and FcγRIIa inhibitors are needed to treat VITT and similar immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia conditions more effectively, leading to better patient outcomes.","The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) remain unclear. Here the authors show that anti-PF4 antibodies are responsible for the activation of platelets and neutrophils, and blockage of FcγRIIa or NETosis in vivo can prevent thrombosis.",2022-09-05
347,Neutralization of hepatitis B virus with vaccine-escape mutations by hepatitis B vaccine with large-HBs antigen,"Although the current hepatitis B (HB) vaccine comprising small-HBs antigen (Ag) is potent and safe, attenuated prophylaxis against hepatitis B virus (HBV) with vaccine-escape mutations (VEMs) has been reported. We investigate an HB vaccine consisting of large-HBsAg that overcomes the shortcomings of the current HB vaccine. Yeast-derived large-HBsAg is immunized into rhesus macaques, and the neutralizing activities of the induced antibodies are compared with those of the current HB vaccine. Although the antibodies induced by the current HB vaccine cannot prevent HBV infection with VEMs, the large-HBsAg vaccine-induced antibodies neutralize those infections. The HBV genotypes that exhibited attenuated neutralization via these vaccines are different. Here, we show that the HB vaccine consisting of large-HBsAg is useful to compensate for the shortcomings of the current HB vaccine. The combined use of these HB vaccines may induce antibodies that can neutralize HBV strains with VEMs or multiple HBV genotypes.","The hepatitis B vaccine is recognised as the most effective approach in reducing hepatitis-B-related morbidity; vaccine-escape mutations are however capable of infecting vaccinated individuals. In this work, authors aim to establish a hepatitis B vaccine candidate, which they assess in rhesus macaques in terms of efficacy and safety.",2022-09-05
348,Rhodium nanocrystals on porous graphdiyne for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution from saline water,The realization of the efficient hydrogen conversion with large current densities at low overpotentials represents the development trend of this field. Here we report the atomic active sites tailoring through a facile synthetic method to yield well-defined Rhodium nanocrystals in aqueous solution using formic acid as the reducing agent and graphdiyne as the stabilizing support. High-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning-transmission electron microscopy images show the high-density atomic steps on the faces of hexahedral Rh nanocrystals. Experimental results reveal the formation of stable sp–C~Rh bonds can stabilize Rh nanocrystals and further improve charge transfer ability in the system. Experimental and density functional theory calculation results solidly demonstrate the exposed high active stepped surfaces and various metal atomic sites affect the electronic structure of the catalyst to reduce the overpotential resulting in the large-current hydrogen production from saline water. This exciting result demonstrates unmatched electrocatalytic performance and highly stable saline water electrolysis.,"While water electrolysis represents a promising means for renewable hydrogen production, the catalysts needed must be efficient at high current densities. Here, authors show rhodium nanocrystals on graphdiyne to efficiently evolve hydrogen from saline water.",2022-09-05
349,In vivo adenine base editing reverts C282Y and improves iron metabolism in hemochromatosis mice,"Hemochromatosis is one of the most common inherited metabolic diseases among white populations and predominantly originates from a homozygous C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. The G > A transition at position c.845 of the gene causes misfolding of the HFE protein, ultimately resulting in its absence at the cell membrane. Consequently, the lack of interaction with the transferrin receptors 1 and 2 leads to systemic iron overload. We screened potential gRNAs in a highly precise cell culture assay and applied an AAV8 split-vector expressing the adenine base editor ABE7.10 and our candidate gRNA in 129-Hfetm.1.1Nca mice. Here we show that a single injection of our therapeutic vector leads to a gene correction rate of >10% and improved iron metabolism in the liver. Our study presents a proof-of-concept for a targeted gene correction therapy for one of the most frequent hereditary diseases affecting humans.","Hemochromatosis is a metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the HFE gene. Here, the authors show that a single administration of AAV8 vectors expressing an Adenine Base Editor facilitates efficient in vivo gene correction in hepatocytes and leads to improvement of iron-specific parameters in the liver and the blood in mouse models of the disease.",2022-09-05

However, they suffer from a low photon-to-charge conversion efficiencies and utilize spectral narrowing techniques which strongly rely on the used material or on a nano-photonic device architecture. Here, we demonstrate a general and facile approach towards wavelength-selective near-infrared phtotodetection through intentionally n-doping 500–600 nm-thick nonfullerene blends. We show that an electron-donating amine-interlayer can induce n-doping, resulting in a localized electric field near the anode and selective collection of photo-generated carriers in this region. As only weakly absorbed photons reach this region, the devices have a narrowband response at wavelengths close to the absorption onset of the blends with a high spectral rejection ratio. These spectrally selective photodetectors exhibit zero-bias external quantum efficiencies of ~20–30% at wavelengths of 900–1100 nm, with a full-width-at-half-maximum of ≤50 nm, as well as detectivities of >1012 Jones.","Fabrication of efficient narrowband near-infrared photodetectors remains a challenge. Here, Liu et al. show a facile and general approach for achieving a sub-50 nm response by intentionally n-doping an optically-thick nonfullerene photodiode using an electron-donating amine-interlayer.",2022-09-03
351,Self-sorting in macroscopic supramolecular self-assembly via additive effects of capillary and magnetic forces,"Supramolecular self-assembly of μm-to-mm sized components is essential to construct complex supramolecular systems. However, the selective assembly to form designated structures at this length scale is challenging because the short-ranged molecular recognition could hardly direct the assembly of macroscopic components. Here we demonstrate a self-sorting mechanism to automatically identify the surface chemistry of μm-to-mm components (A: polycations; B: polyanions) based on the A-B attraction and the A-A repulsion, which is realized by the additivity and the competence between long-ranged magnetic/capillary forces, respectively. Mechanistic studies of the correlation between the magnetic/capillary forces and the interactive distance have revealed the energy landscape of each assembly pattern to support the self-sorting results. By applying this mechanism, the assembly yield of ABA trimers has been increased from 30%~40% under conventional conditions to 100% with self-sorting. Moreover, we have demonstrated rapid and spontaneous self-assembly of advanced chain-like structures with alternate surface chemistry.","The selective assembly of μm-to-mm sized components is challenging because of the short-ranged molecular recognition. Here, the authors demonstrate a self-sorting mechanism to automatically identify the surface chemistry via additivity and competence between long-ranged magnetic/capillary forces.",2022-09-03
352,Taz protects hematopoietic stem cells from an aging-dependent decrease in PU.1 activity,"Specific functions of the immune system are essential to protect us from infections caused by pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. However, as we age, the immune system shows a functional decline that can be attributed in large part to age-associated defects in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)—the cells at the apex of the immune cell hierarchy. Here, we find that the Hippo pathway coactivator TAZ is potently induced in old HSCs and protects these cells from functional decline. We identify Clca3a1 as a TAZ-induced gene that allows us to trace TAZ activity in vivo. Using CLCA3A1 as a marker, we can isolate “young-like” HSCs from old mice. Mechanistically, Taz acts as coactivator of PU.1 and to some extent counteracts the gradual loss of PU.1 expression during HSC aging. Our work thus uncovers an essential role for Taz in a previously undescribed fail-safe mechanism in aging HSCs.","Immune system function declines with age, a consequence of defects in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here the authors show that TAZ buffers age-related loss of PU.1 activity to maintain HSC functionality and identify the surface protein Clca3a1 as a marker of “young-like” HSCs, even in old mice.",2022-09-03
353,Determination of topological edge quantum numbers of fractional quantum Hall phases by thermal conductance measurements,"To determine the topological quantum numbers of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states hosting counter-propagating (CP) downstream (Nd) and upstream (Nu) edge modes, it is pivotal to study quantized transport both in the presence and absence of edge mode equilibration. While reaching the non-equilibrated regime is challenging for charge transport, we target here the thermal Hall conductance GQ, which is purely governed by edge quantum numbers Nd and Nu. Our experimental setup is realized with a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulated graphite gated single layer graphene device. For temperatures up to 35 mK, our measured GQ at ν = 2/3 and 3/5 (with CP modes) match the quantized values of non-equilibrated regime (Nd + Nu)κ0T, where κ0T is a quanta of GQ. With increasing temperature, GQ decreases and eventually takes the value of the equilibrated regime ∣Nd − Nu∣κ0T. By contrast, at ν = 1/3 and 2/5 (without CP modes), GQ remains robustly quantized at Ndκ0T independent of the temperature. Thus, measuring the quantized values of GQ in two regimes, we determine the edge quantum numbers, which opens a new route for finding the topological order of exotic non-Abelian FQH states.",The knowledge of quantum numbers of the edge modes is essential for understanding fractional Hall states containing counter-propagating downstream and upstream modes. Here the authors identify the edge quantum numbers by probing a crossover from non-equilibrated to equilibrated edge mode regime in thermal conductance.,2022-09-03
354,The TFEB-TGIF1 axis regulates EMT in mouse epicardial cells,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex and pivotal process involved in organogenesis and is related to several pathological processes, including cancer and fibrosis. During heart development, EMT mediates the conversion of epicardial cells into vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac interstitial fibroblasts. Here, we show that the oncogenic transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a key regulator of EMT in epicardial cells and that its genetic overexpression in mouse epicardium is lethal due to heart defects linked to impaired EMT. TFEB specifically orchestrates the EMT-promoting function of transforming growth factor (TGF) β, and this effect results from activated transcription of thymine-guanine-interacting factor (TGIF)1, a TGFβ/Smad pathway repressor. The Tgif1 promoter is activated by TFEB, and in vitro and in vivo findings demonstrate its increased expression when Tfeb is overexpressed. Furthermore, Tfeb overexpression in vitro prevents TGFβ-induced EMT, and this effect is abolished by Tgif1 silencing. Tfeb loss of function, similar to that of Tgif1, sensitizes cells to TGFβ, inducing an EMT response to low doses of TGFβ. Together, our findings reveal an unexpected function of TFEB in regulating EMT, which might provide insights into injured heart repair and control of cancer progression.","Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex process involved in organogenesis. Here, the authors show that the transcription factor EB (TFEB) regulates EMT in epicardium during heart development by tuning sensitivity to TGFβ signaling.",2022-09-03
355,Deglacial Subantarctic CO2 outgassing driven by a weakened solubility pump,"The Subantarctic Southern Ocean has long been thought to be an important contributor to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) during glacial-interglacial transitions. Extensive studies suggest that a weakened biological pump, a process associated with nutrient utilization efficiency, drove up surface-water pCO2 in this region during deglaciations. By contrast, regional influences of the solubility pump, a process mainly linked to temperature variations, have been largely overlooked. Here, we evaluate relative roles of the biological and solubility pumps in determining surface-water pCO2 variabilities in the Subantarctic Southern Ocean during the last deglaciation, based on paired reconstructions of surface-water pCO2, temperature, and nutrient utilization efficiency. We show that compared to the biological pump, the solubility pump imposed a strong impact on deglacial Subantarctic surface-water pCO2 variabilities. Our findings therefore reveal a previously underappreciated role of the solubility pump in modulating deglacial Subantarctic CO2 release and possibly past atmospheric pCO2 fluctuations.","Using paired reconstructions of seawater pCO2, temperature, and nutrient utilization, Dai et al. show underappreciated influences of the solubility pump on deglacial Subantarctic surface-water pCO2 variabilities compared to the biological pump.",2022-09-03
356,Cell type-specific calcium imaging of central sensitization in mouse dorsal horn,"Allodynia is a state in which pain is elicited by innocuous stimuli. Capsaicin applied to the skin results in an allodynia that extends to a broad region beyond the application site. This sensitization is thought to be mediated by spinal networks; however, we do not have a clear picture of which spinal neurons mediate this phenomenon. To address this gap, we used two-photon calcium imaging of excitatory interneurons and spinal projection neurons in the mouse spinal dorsal horn. To distinguish among neuronal subtypes, we developed CICADA, a cell profiling approach to identify cell types during calcium imaging. We then identified capsaicin-responsive and capsaicin-sensitized neuronal populations. Capsaicin-sensitized neurons showed emergent responses to innocuous input and increased receptive field sizes consistent with psychophysical reports. Finally, we identified spinal output neurons that showed enhanced responses from innocuous input. These experiments provide a population-level view of central sensitization and a framework with which to model somatosensory integration in the dorsal horn.","Altered mechanosensation by application of capsaicin to the skin is thought to be spinally mediated. Here, the authors use Ca2+ imaging in spinal neurons and develop a cell profiling approach to identify populations involved in central sensitization.",2022-09-03
357,Expanding the terpene biosynthetic code with non-canonical 16 carbon atom building blocks,"Humankind relies on specialized metabolites for medicines, flavors, fragrances, and numerous other valuable biomaterials. However, the chemical space occupied by specialized metabolites, and, thus, their application potential, is limited because their biosynthesis is based on only a handful of building blocks. Engineering organisms to synthesize alternative building blocks will bypass this limitation and enable the sustainable production of molecules with non-canonical chemical structures, expanding the possible applications. Herein, we focus on isoprenoids and combine synthetic biology with protein engineering to construct yeast cells that synthesize 10 non-canonical isoprenoid building blocks with 16 carbon atoms. We identify suitable terpene synthases to convert these building blocks into C16 scaffolds and a cytochrome P450 to decorate the terpene scaffolds and produce different oxygenated compounds. Thus, we reconstruct the modular structure of terpene biosynthesis on 16-carbon backbones, synthesizing 28 different non-canonical terpenes, some of which have interesting odorant properties.","Establishing methods to access the chemical space that lies beyond canonical terpenoid biosynthesis will increase the applications of isoprenoids. Here, the authors reconstruct the modular structure of terpene biosynthesis on 16-carbon backbones by engineered yeast and synthesize 28 different unique terpenes.",2022-09-03
358,Sirtuin 6 maintains epithelial STAT6 activity to support intestinal tuft cell development and type 2 immunity,"Dynamic regulation of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) differentiation is crucial for both homeostasis and the response to helminth infection. SIRT6 belongs to the NAD+-dependent deacetylases and has established diverse roles in aging, metabolism and disease. Here, we report that IEC Sirt6 deletion leads to impaired tuft cell development and type 2 immunity in response to helminth infection, thereby resulting in compromised worm expulsion. Conversely, after helminth infection, IEC SIRT6 transgenic mice exhibit enhanced epithelial remodeling process and more efficient worm clearance. Mechanistically, Sirt6 ablation causes elevated Socs3 expression, and subsequently attenuated tyrosine 641 phosphorylation of STAT6 in IECs. Notably, intestinal epithelial overexpression of constitutively activated STAT6 (STAT6vt) in mice is sufficient to induce the expansion of tuft and goblet cell linage. Furthermore, epithelial STAT6vt overexpression remarkedly reverses the defects in intestinal epithelial remodeling caused by Sirt6 ablation. Our results reveal a novel function of SIRT6 in regulating intestinal epithelial remodeling and mucosal type 2 immunity in response to helminth infection.","Host defense against helminth infection is mediated by mucosal type 2 immunity. Using gain- and loss-of-function mouse models, and mouse intestinal organoids, Xiong et al. show that SIRT6 modulates tuft and goblet cell expansion in intestinal epithelium by activating STAT6 to maintain type 2 mucosal immunity in response to helminth infection.",2022-09-03
359,The genus Serratia revisited by genomics,"The genus Serratia has been studied for over a century and includes clinically-important and diverse environmental members. Despite this, there is a paucity of genomic information across the genus and a robust whole genome-based phylogenetic framework is lacking. Here, we have assembled and analysed a representative set of 664 genomes from across the genus, including 215 historic isolates originally used in defining the genus. Phylogenomic analysis of the genus reveals a clearly-defined population structure which displays deep divisions and aligns with ecological niche, as well as striking congruence between historical biochemical phenotyping data and contemporary genomics data. We highlight the genomic, phenotypic and plasmid diversity of Serratia, and provide evidence of different patterns of gene flow across the genus. Our work provides a framework for understanding the emergence of clinical and other lineages of Serratia.","The genus Serratia includes clinically-important and diverse environmental bacteria. Here, Williams et al. assemble and analyse a representative set of 664 genomes from across the genus, including historic isolates, to provide a genome-based phylogenetic framework for a better understanding of the emergence of clinical and environmental lineages of Serratia.",2022-09-03
360,Suppression of ACE2 SUMOylation protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection through TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagy,"In addition to investigating the virology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), discovering the host–virus dependencies are essential to identify and design effective antiviral therapy strategy. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, ACE2, conjugates with small ubiquitin-like modifier 3 (SUMO3) and provide evidence indicating that prevention of ACE2 SUMOylation can block SARS-CoV-2 infection. E3 SUMO ligase PIAS4 prompts the SUMOylation and stabilization of ACE2, whereas deSUMOylation enzyme SENP3 reverses this process. Conjugation of SUMO3 with ACE2 at lysine (K) 187 hampers the K48-linked ubiquitination of ACE2, thus suppressing its subsequent cargo receptor TOLLIP-dependent autophagic degradation. TOLLIP deficiency results in the stabilization of ACE2 and elevated SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, our findings suggest selective autophagic degradation of ACE2 orchestrated by SUMOylation and ubiquitination as a potential way to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","SARS- CoV-2 hijacks ACE2 for cell entry. Here, the authors report that dynamic SUMOylation modulates the TOLLIP-directed selective autophagic degradation of ACE2 and suggest SUMOylation inhibition as a potential intervention against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2022-09-03
361,Attosecond dynamics of multi-channel single photon ionization,"Photoionization of atoms and molecules is one of the fastest processes in nature. The understanding of the ultrafast temporal dynamics of this process often requires the characterization of the different angular momentum channels over a broad energy range. Using a two-photon interferometry technique based on extreme ultraviolet and infrared ultrashort pulses, we measure the phase and amplitude of the individual angular momentum channels as a function of kinetic energy in the outer-shell photoionization of neon. This allows us to unravel the influence of channel interference as well as the effect of the short-range, Coulomb and centrifugal potentials, on the dynamics of the photoionization process.","Understanding of photoionization dynamics, one of the fastest processes in nature, requires the characterization of all underlying ionization channels. Here the authors use an interferometry technique based on attosecond pulses to measure the phase and amplitude of the individual angular momentum channels in the photoionization of neon.",2022-09-03
362,The nucleolus is the site for inflammatory RNA decay during infection,"Inflammatory cytokines are key signaling molecules that can promote an immune response, thus their RNA turnover must be tightly controlled during infection. Most studies investigate the RNA decay pathways in the cytosol or nucleoplasm but never focused on the nucleolus. Although this organelle has well-studied roles in ribosome biogenesis and cellular stress sensing, the mechanism of RNA decay within the nucleolus is not completely understood. Here, we report that the nucleolus is an essential site of inflammatory pre-mRNA instability during infection. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that not only do inflammatory genes have higher intronic read densities compared with non-inflammatory genes, but their pre-mRNAs are highly enriched in nucleoli during infection. Notably, nucleolin (NCL) acts as a guide factor for recruiting cytosine or uracil (C/U)-rich sequence-containing inflammatory pre-mRNAs and the Rrp6-exosome complex to the nucleolus through a physical interaction, thereby enabling targeted RNA delivery to Rrp6-exosomes and subsequent degradation. Consequently, Ncl depletion causes aberrant hyperinflammation, resulting in a severe lethality in response to LPS. Importantly, the dynamics of NCL post-translational modifications determine its functional activity in phases of LPS. This process represents a nucleolus-dependent pathway for maintaining inflammatory gene expression integrity and immunological homeostasis during infection.","The nucleolus is the traditional site for ribosomal RNA biogenesis. Here, the authors find that the nucleolus is a site of inflammatory pre-mRNA turnover and elucidated how immune homeostasis can be maintained by controlling inflammatory gene expression.",2022-09-03
363,Observation of formation and local structures of metal-organic layers via complementary electron microscopy techniques,"Metal-organic layers (MOLs) are highly attractive for application in catalysis, separation, sensing and biomedicine, owing to their tunable framework structure. However, it is challenging to obtain comprehensive information about the formation and local structures of MOLs using standard electron microscopy methods due to serious damage under electron beam irradiation. Here, we investigate the growth processes and local structures of MOLs utilizing a combination of liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy, cryogenic electron microscopy and electron ptychography. Our results show a multistep formation process, where precursor clusters first form in solution, then they are complexed with ligands to form non-crystalline solids, followed by the arrangement of the cluster-ligand complex into crystalline sheets, with additional possible growth by the addition of clusters to surface edges. Moreover, high-resolution imaging allows us to identify missing clusters, dislocations, loop and flat surface terminations and ligand connectors in the MOLs. Our observations provide insights into controllable MOL crystal morphology, defect engineering, and surface modification, thus assisting novel MOL design and synthesis.","Obtaining information about the structure of metal-organic layers (MOLs) using standard electron microscopy methods is challenging due to damage under electron beam irradiation.

364,Identification of risk loci for primary aldosteronism in genome-wide association studies,"Primary aldosteronism affects up to 10% of hypertensive patients and is responsible for treatment resistance and increased cardiovascular risk. Here we perform a genome-wide association study in a discovery cohort of 562 cases and 950 controls and identify three main loci on chromosomes 1, 13 and X; associations on chromosome 1 and 13 are replicated in a second cohort and confirmed by a meta-analysis involving 1162 cases and 3296 controls. The association on chromosome 13 is specific to men and stronger in bilateral adrenal hyperplasia than aldosterone producing adenoma. Candidate genes located within the two loci, CASZ1 and RXFP2, are expressed in human and mouse adrenals in different cell clusters. Their overexpression in adrenocortical cells suppresses mineralocorticoid output under basal and stimulated conditions, without affecting cortisol biosynthesis. Our study identifies the first risk loci for primary aldosteronism and highlights new mechanisms for the development of aldosterone excess.","Detection of primary aldosteronism, the most common form of secondary arterial hypertension, is essential for targeted management and prevention of cardiovascular complications. Here, the authors identify genetic loci associated with primary aldosteronism, suggesting new mechanisms of disease.",2022-09-03
365,Stereoretentive cross-coupling of chiral amino acid chlorides and hydrocarbons through mechanistically controlled Ni/Ir photoredox catalysis,"The direct modification of naturally occurring chiral amino acids to their amino ketone analogs is a significant synthetic challenge. Here, an efficient and robust cross-coupling reaction between chiral amino acid chlorides and unactivated C(sp3)–H hydrocarbons is achieved by a mechanistically designed Ni/Ir photoredox catalysis. This reaction, which proceeds under mild conditions, enables modular access to a wide variety of chiral amino ketones that retain the stereochemistry of the starting amino acids. In-depth mechanistic analysis reveals that the strategic generation of an N-acyllutidinium intermediate is critical for the success of this reaction. The barrierless reduction of the N-acyllutidinium intermediate facilitates the delivery of chiral amino ketones with retention of stereochemistry. This pathway avoids the formation of a detrimental nickel intermediate, which could be responsible for undesirable decarbonylation and transmetalation reactions that limit the utility of previously reported methods.","Chiral α-amino ketones are privileged motifs in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. Here, the authors develop an efficient method to synthesize these structures via stereoretentive direct cross-coupling of amino acid chlorides with simple aliphatic substrates.",2022-09-03
366,Spermidine-mediated hypusination of translation factor EIF5A improves mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and prevents non-alcoholic steatohepatitis progression,"Spermidine is a natural polyamine that has health benefits and extends life span in several species. Deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) are key enzymes that utilize spermidine to catalyze the post-translational hypusination of the translation factor EIF5A (EIF5AH). Here, we have found that hepatic DOHH mRNA expression is decreased in patients and mice with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and hepatic cells treated with fatty acids. The mouse and cell culture models of NASH have concomitant decreases in Eif5aH and mitochondrial protein synthesis which leads to lower mitochondrial activity and fatty acid β-oxidation. Spermidine treatment restores EIF5AH, partially restores protein synthesis and mitochondrial function in NASH, and prevents NASH progression in vivo. Thus, the disrupted DHPS-DOHH-EIF5AH pathway during NASH represents a therapeutic target to increase hepatic protein synthesis and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and prevent NASH progression.","Spermidine, a polyamine reported to extend lifespan and reduce the risk of age-related diseases, serves as a substrate for the post-translational modification hypusination. Here the authors report that EIF5A hypusination, which regulates mitochondrial protein synthesis, is reduced during non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can be prevented by spermidine to inhibit the progression of NASH in mice.",2022-09-03
367,Electronic modulation of metal-support interactions improves polypropylene hydrogenolysis over ruthenium catalysts,"Ruthenium (Ru) is the one of the most promising catalysts for polyolefin hydrogenolysis. Its performance varies widely with the support, but the reasons remain unknown. Here, we introduce a simple synthetic strategy (using ammonia as a modulator) to tune metal-support interactions and apply it to Ru deposited on titania (TiO2). We demonstrate that combining deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with temperature variation and density functional theory can reveal the complex nature, binding strength, and H amount. H2 activation occurs heterolytically, leading to a hydride on Ru, an H+ on the nearest oxygen, and a partially positively charged Ru. This leads to partial reduction of TiO2 and high coverages of H for spillover, showcasing a threefold increase in hydrogenolysis rates. This result points to the key role of the surface hydrogen coverage in improving hydrogenolysis catalyst performance.",Catalytic pathways of plastic waste valorization to lubricants are attractive avenues to foster circular economy. Tuning of catalyst electronic properties allows to significantly improve its activity due to boosted hydrogen storage on the surface.,2022-09-03
368,X-ray crystallographic characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease polyprotein cleavage sites essential for viral processing and maturation,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes COVID-19, produces polyproteins 1a and 1ab that contain, respectively, 11 or 16 non-structural proteins (nsp). Nsp5 is the main protease (Mpro) responsible for cleavage at eleven positions along these polyproteins, including at its own N- and C-terminal boundaries, representing essential processing events for viral assembly and maturation. Using C-terminally substituted Mpro chimeras, we have determined X-ray crystallographic structures of Mpro in complex with 10 of its 11 viral cleavage sites, bound at full occupancy intermolecularly in trans, within the active site of either the native enzyme and/or a catalytic mutant (C145A). Capture of both acyl-enzyme intermediate and product-like complex forms of a P2(Leu) substrate in the native active site provides direct comparative characterization of these mechanistic steps as well as further informs the basis for enhanced product release of Mpro’s own unique C-terminal P2(Phe) cleavage site to prevent autoinhibition. We characterize the underlying noncovalent interactions governing binding and specificity for this diverse set of substrates, showing remarkable plasticity for subsites beyond the anchoring P1(Gln)-P2(Leu/Val/Phe), representing together a near complete analysis of a multiprocessing viral protease. Collectively, these crystallographic snapshots provide valuable mechanistic and structural insights for antiviral therapeutic development.","The SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro is essential for viral replication. Here, the authors have determined the structures of Mpro in complex with 10 of the 11 viral cleavage sequences including a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate, providing mechanistic and structural insights for antiviral development.",2022-09-03
369,Controllable synthesis of conjugated microporous polymer films for ultrasensitive detection of chemical warfare agents,"Nerve agents, one of the most toxic chemical warfare agents, seriously threaten human life and public security. The high toxicity of nerve agents makes the development of fluorescence sensors with suitable limit of detection challenging. Here, we propose a sensor design based on a conjugated microporous polymer film for the detection of diethyl chlorophosphate, a substitute of Sarin, with low detection limit of 2.5 ppt. This is due to the synergy of the susceptible on-off effect of hybridization and de-hybridization of hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) materials and the microporous structure of CMP films facilitating the inward diffusion of DCP vapors, and the extended π-conjugated structure. This strategy provides a new idea for the future development of gas sensors. In addition, a portable sensor is successfully integrated based on TCzP-CMP films that enables wireless, remote, ultrasensitive, and real-time detection of DCP vapors.","The high toxicity of nerve agents makes the development of fluorescence sensors with suitable limit of detection challenging.

370,Interrupted-time-series analysis of the immediate impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on preterm birth in China,"Preliminary evidence from China and other countries has suggested that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation measures have caused a decline in preterm births, but evidence is conflicting. Utilising a national representative data of 11,714,947 pregnant women in China, we explored the immediate changes in preterm birth rates during the COVID-19 mitigation period using an interrupted-time-series analysis. We defined the period prior to February 1, 2020 as the baseline, followed by the COVID-19 mitigation stage. In the first month of the COVID-19 mitigation, a significant absolute decrease in preterm birth rates of 0.68% (95%CI:−1.10% to −0.26%) in singleton, and of 2.80% (95%CI:−4.51% to −1.09%) in multiple births was noted. This immediate decline in Wuhan was greater than that at the national level among singleton births [−2.21% (95%CI:−4.09% to −0.34% vs. −0.68%)]. Here we report an immediate impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on preterm birth in China.","The broader impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures may include changes in the incidence of preterm birth.

371,Mapping autophagosome contents identifies interleukin-7 receptor-α as a key cargo modulating CD4+ T cell proliferation,"CD4+ T cells are pivotal cells playing roles in the orchestration of humoral and cytotoxic immune responses. It is known that CD4+ T cell proliferation relies on autophagy, but identification of the autophagosomal cargo involved is missing. Here we create a transgenic mouse model, to enable direct mapping of the proteinaceous content of autophagosomes in primary cells by LC3 proximity labelling. Interleukin-7 receptor-α, a cytokine receptor mostly found in naïve and memory T cells, is reproducibly detected in autophagosomes of activated CD4+ T cells. Consistently, CD4+ T cells lacking autophagy show increased interleukin-7 receptor-α surface expression, while no defect in internalisation is observed. Mechanistically, excessive surface interleukin-7 receptor-α sequestrates the common gamma chain, impairing the interleukin-2 receptor assembly and downstream signalling crucial for T cell proliferation. This study shows that key autophagy substrates can be reliably identified in this mouse model and help mechanistically unravel autophagy’s contribution to healthy physiology and disease.",Autophagy is known to impact CD4+ T cell proliferation but the identity of autophagosomal components remain unclear. Here the authors leverage a transgenic mouse model to assess the autophagosomal compartment and identify interleukin-7 receptor-α as a key cargo in proliferating CD4+ T cells.,2022-09-02
372,Active learning of reactive Bayesian force fields applied to heterogeneous catalysis dynamics of H/Pt,"Atomistic modeling of chemically reactive systems has so far relied on either expensive ab initio methods or bond-order force fields requiring arduous parametrization. Here, we describe a Bayesian active learning framework for autonomous “on-the-fly” training of fast and accurate reactive many-body force fields during molecular dynamics simulations. At each time-step, predictive uncertainties of a sparse Gaussian process are evaluated to automatically determine whether additional ab initio training data are needed. We introduce a general method for mapping trained kernel models onto equivalent polynomial models whose prediction cost is much lower and independent of the training set size. As a demonstration, we perform direct two-phase simulations of heterogeneous H2 turnover on the Pt(111) catalyst surface at chemical accuracy. The model trains itself in three days and performs at twice the speed of a ReaxFF model, while maintaining much higher fidelity to DFT and excellent agreement with experiment.",Uncertainty-aware machine learning models are used to automate the training of reactive force fields.

However, it remains unclear how non-canonical sequence motifs collectively control transcription rates. Here, we combine massively parallel assays, biophysics, and machine learning to develop a 346-parameter model that predicts site-specific transcription initiation rates for any σ70 promoter sequence, validated across 22132 bacterial promoters with diverse sequences. We apply the model to predict genetic context effects, design σ70 promoters with desired transcription rates, and identify undesired promoters inside engineered genetic systems. The model provides a biophysical basis for understanding gene regulation in natural genetic systems and precise transcriptional control for engineering synthetic genetic systems.","Transcription rates are regulated by the interactions between RNA polymerase, sigma factor, and promoter DNA sequences in bacteria.

374,Optical-Tweezers-integrating-Differential-Dynamic-Microscopy maps the spatiotemporal propagation of nonlinear strains in polymer blends and composites,"How local stresses propagate through polymeric fluids, and, more generally, how macromolecular dynamics give rise to viscoelasticity are open questions vital to wide-ranging scientific and industrial fields. Here, to unambiguously connect polymer dynamics to force response, and map the deformation fields that arise in macromolecular materials, we present Optical-Tweezers-integrating-Differential -Dynamic-Microscopy (OpTiDMM) that simultaneously imposes local strains, measures resistive forces, and analyzes the motion of the surrounding polymers. Our measurements with blends of ring and linear polymers (DNA) and their composites with stiff polymers (microtubules) uncover an unexpected resonant response, in which strain alignment, superdiffusivity, and elasticity are maximized when the strain rate is comparable to the entanglement rate. Microtubules suppress this resonance, while substantially increasing elastic storage, due to varying degrees to which the polymers buildup, stretch and flow along the strain path, and configurationally relax induced stress. More broadly, the rich multi-scale coupling of mechanics and dynamics afforded by OpTiDDM, empowers its interdisciplinary use to elucidate non-trivial phenomena that sculpt stress propagation dynamics–critical to commercial applications and cell mechanics alike.","The authors present an approach to connect polymer dynamics to force response by integrating optical tweezers with differential dynamic microscopy.

However, the development of monolithic nanoporous intermetallics, with ample active sites and sufficient electrocatalytic activity, remains a challenge. Here we report the fabrication of nanoporous Co7Mo6 and Fe7Mo6 intermetallic compounds via liquid metal dealloying. Along with the development of three-dimensional bicontinuous open porosity, high-temperature dealloying overcomes the kinetic energy barrier, enabling the direct formation of chemically ordered intermetallic phases. Unprecedented small characteristic lengths are observed for the nanoporous intermetallic compounds, resulting from an intermetallic effect whereby the chemical ordering during nanopore formation lowers surface diffusivity and significantly suppresses the thermal coarsening of dealloyed nanostructure. The resulting ultrafine nanoporous Co7Mo6 exhibits high catalytic activity and durability in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reactions. This study sheds light on the previously unexplored intermetallic effect in dealloying and facilitates the development of advanced intermetallic catalysts for energy applications.",Nanoscale intermetallic compounds are promising catalysts but the synthesis remains a challenge. The authors develop a dealloying technique to fabricate nanoporous intermetallic electrocatalysts with fine structures for efficient hydrogen production.,2022-09-02
376,Early warning signal for a tipping point suggested by a millennial Atlantic Multidecadal Variability reconstruction,"Atlantic multidecadal variability is a coherent mode of natural climate variability occurring in the North Atlantic Ocean, with strong impacts on human societies and ecosystems worldwide. However, its periodicity and drivers are widely debated due to the short temporal extent of instrumental observations and competing effects of both internal and external climate factors acting on North Atlantic surface temperature variability. Here, we use a paleoclimate database and an advanced statistical framework to generate, evaluate, and compare 312 reconstructions of the Atlantic multidecadal variability over the past millennium, based on different indices and regression methods. From this process, the best reconstruction is obtained with the random forest method, and its robustness is checked using climate model outputs and independent oceanic paleoclimate data. This reconstruction shows that memory in variations of Atlantic multidecadal variability have strongly increased recently—a potential early warning signal for the approach of a North Atlantic tipping point.",This study presents a last millennium reconstruction of Atlantic Multidecadal Variability fluctuations. This sufficiently long and validated reconstruction suggests the potential approach of a tipping point in the North Atlantic current system.,2022-09-02
377,The Holocene temperature conundrum answered by mollusk records from East Asia,"Seasonal biases (the warm-season contribution) of Holocene mean annual temperature (MAT) reconstructions from geological records were proposed as a possible cause of the mismatch with climate simulated temperature. Here we analyze terrestrial mollusk assemblages that best reflect seasonal signals and provide quantitative MAT and four-season temperature records for northern China during the past 20,000 years. The MAT estimated from the seasonal temperatures of a four-season-mean based on mollusks shows a peak during ~9000–4000 years ago, followed by a cooling trend. In general, the contribution of summer and winter temperature to MAT is significantly greater than that of spring and autumn temperatures. The relative contribution of each season varies over time and corresponds roughly with the seasonal insolation in each season. This independent evidence from mollusk records from the mid-latitudes of East Asia does not support the Holocene long-term warming trend observed in climate simulations and the seasonal bias explanation.","Scientists have been puzzled by the disparity between climate simulations of the past 12,000 years and geological records. Dong et al. reconstructed past annual and seasonal temperatures from land snail records to examine the potential seasonal bias.",2022-09-02
378,Structural basis for Gemin5 decamer-mediated mRNA binding,"Gemin5 in the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) complex serves as the RNA-binding protein to deliver small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) to the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein Sm complex via its N-terminal WD40 domain. Additionally, the C-terminal region plays an important role in regulating RNA translation by directly binding to viral RNAs and cellular mRNAs. Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of the Gemin5 C-terminal region, which adopts a homodecamer architecture comprised of a dimer of pentamers. By structural analysis, mutagenesis, and RNA-binding assays, we find that the intact pentamer/decamer is critical for the Gemin5 C-terminal region to bind cognate RNA ligands and to regulate mRNA translation. The Gemin5 high-order architecture is assembled via pentamerization, allowing binding to RNA ligands in a coordinated manner. We propose a model depicting the regulatory role of Gemin5 in selective RNA binding and translation. Therefore, our work provides insights into the SMN complex-independent function of Gemin5.","Structural biology, complemented by biochemistry experiments and RNA-binding assays show that the Gemin5 C-terminal region adopts a decamer architecture. Gemin5 decamerization is essential for its role in regulating mRNA translation.",2022-09-02
379,Marine phosphate availability and the chemical origins of life on Earth,"Prebiotic systems chemistry suggests that high phosphate concentrations were necessary to synthesise molecular building blocks and sustain primitive cellular systems. However, current understanding of mineral solubility predicts negligible phosphate concentrations for most natural waters, yet the role of Fe2+, ubiquitous on early Earth, is poorly quantified. Here we determine the solubility of Fe(II)-phosphate in synthetic seawater as a function of pH and ionic strength, integrate these observations into a thermodynamic model that predicts phosphate concentrations across a range of aquatic conditions, and validate these predictions against modern anoxic sediment pore waters. Experiments and models show that Fe2+ significantly increases the solubility of all phosphate minerals in anoxic systems, suggesting that Hadean and Archean seawater featured phosphate concentrations ~103–104 times higher than currently estimated. This suggests that seawater readily met the phosphorus requirements of emergent cellular systems and early microbial life, perhaps fueling primary production during the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis.","Phosphate is critical for all life on Earth but its origins have remained enigmatic. Experiments indicate that phosphate may have been abundant in ancient Fe-rich seawater, providing a crucial ingredient for the origins of life on Earth.",2022-09-02
380,Fabrication of Salvinia-inspired surfaces for hydrodynamic drag reduction by capillary-force-induced clustering,"For decades, bioinspired functional materials have been attracting the interest of many researchers for their remarkable characteristics. In particular, some plant leaves are well known for their inherent superhydrophobic nature. Salvinia molesta, a free-floating aquatic fern, has egg-beater-shaped hierarchical trichomes on its surface of leaves. Due to the unique structure and complex wettability of the hairs, this plant has the ability to maintain a stable thick air layer upon the structure when it is submerged underwater. Often referred to as the “Salvinia Effect,” this property is expected to be suitable for use in hydrodynamic drag reduction. However, due to the complex shape of the trichome, currently applied fabrication methods are using a three-dimensional printing system, which is not applicable to mass production because of its severely limited productivity. In this work, artificial Salvinia leaf inspired by S. molesta was fabricated using a conventional soft lithography method assisted with capillary-force-induced clustering of micropillar array. The fabrication method suggested in this work proposes a promising strategy for the manufacturing of Salvinia-inspired hydrodynamic drag reduction surfaces.","Salvinia molesta plant has the ability to maintain a stable air layer when submerged underwater due to its specific form. The authors propose here a soft lithography fabrication method of artificial Salvinia leaf assisted with capillary-force induced clustering of micropillar array, for hydrodynamic drag reduction.",2022-09-02
381,Proton-driven alternating access in a spinster lipid transporter,"Spinster (Spns) lipid transporters are critical for transporting sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) across cellular membranes. In humans, Spns2 functions as the main S1P transporter in endothelial cells, making it a potential drug target for modulating S1P signaling. Here, we employed an integrated approach in lipid membranes to identify unknown conformational states of a bacterial Spns from Hyphomonas neptunium (HnSpns) and to define its proton- and substrate-coupled conformational dynamics. Our systematic study reveals conserved residues critical for protonation steps and their regulation, and how sequential protonation of these proton switches coordinates the conformational transitions in the context of a noncanonical ligand-dependent alternating access. A conserved periplasmic salt bridge (Asp60TM2:Arg289TM7) keeps the transporter in a closed conformation, while proton-dependent conformational dynamics are significantly enhanced on the periplasmic side, providing a pathway for ligand exchange.","The Spns lipid transporters use ion gradients to drive substrate transport, including bioactive sphingolipids. Here, Dastvan et al. investigated how binding of protons powers the conformational changes that enable broad transport by a bacterial Spns.",2022-09-02
382,Collective total synthesis of C4-oxygenated securinine-type alkaloids via stereocontrolled diversifications on the piperidine core,"Securinega alkaloids have fascinated the synthetic chemical community for over six decades. Historically, major research foci in securinega alkaloid synthesis have been on the efficient construction of the fused tetracyclic framework that bears a butenolide moiety and tertiary amine-based heterocycles. These “basic” securinega alkaloids have evolved to undergo biosynthetic oxidative diversifications, especially on the piperidine core. However, a general synthetic solution to access these high-oxidation state securinega alkaloids is lacking. In this study, we have completed the total synthesis of various C4-oxygenated securinine-type alkaloids including securingines A, C, D, securitinine, secu’amamine D, phyllanthine, and 4-epi-phyllanthine. Our synthetic strategy features stereocontrolled oxidation, rearrangement, and epimerization at N1 and C2–C4 positions of the piperidine core within (neo)securinane scaffolds. Our discoveries provide a fundamental synthetic solution to all known securinine-type natural products with various oxidative and stereochemical variations around the central piperidine ring.","A general synthetic solution toward high-oxidation state securinega alkaloids could be useful for systematic biological studies. Here, the authors report a divergent synthesis of C4-oxygenated securinega alkaloids via stereocontrolled diversifications on the piperidine core.",2022-09-02
383,"Fast, efficient, and accurate neuro-imaging denoising via supervised deep learning","Volumetric functional imaging is widely used for recording neuron activities in vivo, but there exist tradeoffs between the quality of the extracted calcium traces, imaging speed, and laser power. While deep-learning methods have recently been applied to denoise images, their applications to downstream analyses, such as recovering high-SNR calcium traces, have been limited. Further, these methods require temporally-sequential pre-registered data acquired at ultrafast rates. Here, we demonstrate a supervised deep-denoising method to circumvent these tradeoffs for several applications, including whole-brain imaging, large-field-of-view imaging in freely moving animals, and recovering complex neurite structures in C. elegans. Our framework has 30× smaller memory footprint, and is fast in training and inference (50–70 ms); it is highly accurate and generalizable, and further, trained with only small, non-temporally-sequential, independently-acquired training datasets (∼500 pairs of images). We envision that the framework will enable faster and long-term imaging experiments necessary to study neuronal mechanisms of many behaviors.","Volumetric functional imaging is widely used for recording neuron activities in vivo for many experimental organisms. Here the authors report supervised deep-denoising methods for improved whole-brain imaging, large field-of-view imaging in freely moving animals, and recovering complex neurite structures in C. elegans.",2022-09-02
384,Identification of a cross-neutralizing antibody that targets the receptor binding site of H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses,"Influenza A viruses pose a significant threat globally each year, underscoring the need for a vaccine- or antiviral-based broad-protection strategy. Here, we describe a chimeric monoclonal antibody, C12H5, that offers neutralization against seasonal and pandemic H1N1 viruses, and cross-protection against some H5N1 viruses. Notably, C12H5 mAb offers broad neutralizing activity against H1N1 and H5N1 viruses by controlling virus entry and egress, and offers protection against H1N1 and H5N1 viral challenge in vivo. Through structural analyses, we show that C12H5 engages hemagglutinin (HA), the major surface glycoprotein on influenza, at a distinct epitope overlapping the receptor binding site and covering the 140-loop. We identified eight highly conserved (~90%) residues that are essential for broad H1N1 recognition, with evidence of tolerance for Asp or Glu at position 190; this site is a molecular determinant for human or avian host-specific recognition and this tolerance endows C12H5 with cross-neutralization potential. Our results could benefit the development of antiviral drugs and the design of broad-protection influenza vaccines.","Circulating subtypes of Influenza viruses seasonally change and therefore vaccines need to be matched to these strains each year, which is why there is a need for next-generation vaccines that can elicit broad and cross-type protection. Here, Li et al. generate a human-mouse chimeric antibody with broad neutralizing activity against seasonal and pandemic H1N1 and some H5N1 viruses in vivo and identify residues on hemagglutinin relevant for its broad neutralization activity.",2022-09-02
385,Momentum-selective orbital hybridisation,"When a molecule interacts chemically with a metal surface, the orbitals of the molecule hybridise with metal states to form the new eigenstates of the coupled system. Spatial overlap and energy matching are determining parameters of the hybridisation. However, since every molecular orbital does not only have a characteristic spatial shape, but also a specific momentum distribution, one may additionally expect a momentum matching condition; after all, each hybridising wave function of the metal has a defined wave vector, too. Here, we report photoemission orbital tomography measurements of hybrid orbitals that emerge from molecular orbitals at a molecule-on-metal interface. We find that in the hybrid orbitals only those partial waves of the original orbital survive which match the metal band structure. Moreover, we find that the conversion of the metal’s surface state into a hybrid interface state is also governed by momentum matching constraints. Our experiments demonstrate the possibility to measure hybridisation momentum-selectively, thereby enabling deep insights into the complicated interplay of bulk states, surface states, and molecular orbitals in the formation of the electronic interface structure at molecule-on-metal hybrid interfaces.","When a molecule interacts chemically with a metal, its orbitals hybridise with metal states to form the new eigenstates of the coupled system. Here, the authors show that in addition to overlap in real space and energy, hybridizing states must fulfil a momentum-matching condition.",2022-09-02
386,Isoform-specific and ubiquitination dependent recruitment of Tet1 to replicating heterochromatin modulates methylcytosine oxidation,"Oxidation of the epigenetic DNA mark 5-methylcytosine by Tet dioxygenases is an established route to diversify the epigenetic information, modulate gene expression and overall cellular (patho-)physiology. Here, we demonstrate that Tet1 and its short isoform Tet1s exhibit distinct nuclear localization during DNA replication resulting in aberrant cytosine modification levels in human and mouse cells. We show that Tet1 is tethered away from heterochromatin via its zinc finger domain, which is missing in Tet1s allowing its targeting to these regions. We find that Tet1s interacts with and is ubiquitinated by CRL4(VprBP). The ubiquitinated Tet1s is then recognized by Uhrf1 and recruited to late replicating heterochromatin. This leads to spreading of 5-methylcytosine oxidation to heterochromatin regions, LINE 1 activation and chromatin decondensation. In summary, we elucidate a dual regulation mechanism of Tet1, contributing to the understanding of how epigenetic information can be diversified by spatio-temporal directed Tet1 catalytic activity.","A short isoform of the Tet1 enzyme (Tet1s) that oxidizes the DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) mark is overexpressed in tumors. Here the authors show Tet1s, but not full length Tet1, changes localization over the cell cycle upon ubiquitination and Uhrf1 interaction and is targeted to heterochromatin during S-phase. This leads to 5mC oxidation and loss of DNA methylation in heterochromatin.",2022-09-02
387,"Small, correlated changes in synaptic connectivity may facilitate rapid motor learning","Animals rapidly adapt their movements to external perturbations, a process paralleled by changes in neural activity in the motor cortex. Experimental studies suggest that these changes originate from altered inputs (Hinput) rather than from changes in local connectivity (Hlocal), as neural covariance is largely preserved during adaptation. Since measuring synaptic changes in vivo remains very challenging, we used a modular recurrent neural network to qualitatively test this interpretation. As expected, Hinput resulted in small activity changes and largely preserved covariance. Surprisingly given the presumed dependence of stable covariance on preserved circuit connectivity, Hlocal led to only slightly larger changes in activity and covariance, still within the range of experimental recordings. This similarity is due to Hlocal only requiring small, correlated connectivity changes for successful adaptation. Simulations of tasks that impose increasingly larger behavioural changes revealed a growing difference between Hinput and Hlocal, which could be exploited when designing future experiments.","How animals are able to rapidly adapt their behaviour to changing environmental demands remains poorly understood. Here, the authors use a modelling approach to show that synaptic plasticity in motor cortex may underlie rapid motor learning, demonstrating that small, correlated connectivity changes that preserve neural covariance are highly effective in driving behavioural adaptation.",2022-09-02
388,Distinct metabolic states guide maturation of inflammatory and tolerogenic dendritic cells,"Cellular metabolism underpins immune cell functionality, yet our understanding of metabolic influences in human dendritic cell biology and their ability to orchestrate immune responses is poorly developed. Here, we map single-cell metabolic states and immune profiles of inflammatory and tolerogenic monocytic dendritic cells using recently developed multiparametric approaches. Single-cell metabolic pathway activation scores reveal simultaneous engagement of multiple metabolic pathways in distinct monocytic dendritic cell differentiation stages. GM-CSF/IL4-induce rapid reprogramming of glycolytic monocytes and transient co-activation of mitochondrial pathways followed by TLR4-dependent maturation of dendritic cells. Skewing of the mTOR:AMPK phosphorylation balance and upregulation of OXPHOS, glycolytic and fatty acid oxidation metabolism underpin metabolic hyperactivity and an immunosuppressive phenotype of tolerogenic dendritic cells, which exhibit maturation-resistance and a de-differentiated immune phenotype marked by unique immunoregulatory receptor signatures. This single-cell dataset provides important insights into metabolic pathways impacting the immune profiles of human dendritic cells.","Assessing metabolic activity within single cells rather than at a population level has a number of advantages. Here, the authors use a flow and mass cytometry based approach that assess the metabolic differences between populations of human immune stimulatory and tolerogenic dendritic cells.",2022-09-02
389,Metamaterial-based real-time communication with high information density by multipath twisting of acoustic wave,"Speeding up the transmission of information carried by waves is of fundamental interest for wave physics, with pivotal significance for underwater communications. To overcome the current limitations in information transfer capacity, here we propose and experimentally validate a mechanism using multipath sound twisting to realize real-time high-capacity communication free of signal-processing or sensor-scanning. The undesired channel crosstalk, conventionally reduced via time-consuming postprocessing, is virtually suppressed by using a metamaterial layer as purely-passive demultiplexer with high spatial selectivity. Furthermore, the compactness of system ensures high information density crucial for acoustics-based applications. A distinct example of complicated image transmission is experimentally demonstrated, showing as many independent channels as the path number multiplied by vortex mode number and an extremely-low bit error rate nearly 1/10 of the forward error correction limit. Our strategy opens an avenue to metamaterial-based high-capacity communication paradigm compatible with the conventional multiplexing mechanisms, with far-reaching impact on acoustics and other domains.","Here, the authors demonstrate multipath twisting of acoustic waves with a thin metamaterial layer enabling high-speed transfer of information with no time-consuming post-processing or sensor scanning, showing important application potential in underwater communication.",2022-09-02
390,Rtt105 regulates RPA function by configurationally stapling the flexible domains,"Replication Protein A (RPA) is a heterotrimeric complex that binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and recruits over three dozen RPA-interacting proteins to coordinate multiple aspects of DNA metabolism including DNA replication, repair, and recombination. Rtt105 is a molecular chaperone that regulates nuclear localization of RPA. Here, we show that Rtt105 binds to multiple DNA binding and protein-interaction domains of RPA and configurationally staples the complex. In the absence of ssDNA, Rtt105 inhibits RPA binding to Rad52, thus preventing spurious binding to RPA-interacting proteins. When ssDNA is available, Rtt105 promotes formation of high-density RPA nucleoprotein filaments and dissociates during this process. Free Rtt105 further stabilizes the RPA-ssDNA filaments by inhibiting the facilitated exchange activity of RPA. Collectively, our data suggest that Rtt105 sequesters free RPA in the nucleus to prevent untimely binding to RPA-interacting proteins, while stabilizing RPA-ssDNA filaments at DNA lesion sites.","The single stranded DNA binding protein RPA coordinates DNA metabolism using multiple protein and DNA interaction domains. Here, the authors show that the chaperone-like protein Rtt105 staples RPA domains to prevent untimely protein interactions.",2022-09-02
391,Wireless charging-mediated angiogenesis and nerve repair by adaptable microporous hydrogels from conductive building blocks,"Traumatic brain injury causes inflammation and glial scarring that impede brain tissue repair, so stimulating angiogenesis and recovery of brain function remain challenging. Here we present an adaptable conductive microporous hydrogel consisting of gold nanoyarn balls-coated injectable building blocks possessing interconnected pores to improve angiogenesis and recovery of brain function in traumatic brain injury. We show that following minimally invasive implantation, the adaptable hydrogel is able to fill defects with complex shapes and regulate the traumatic brain injury environment in a mouse model. We find that placement of this injectable hydrogel at peri-trauma regions enhances mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor by 180% and improves angiogenesis by 250% in vivo within 2 weeks after electromagnetized stimulation, and that these effects facilitate neuron survival and motor function recovery by 50%. We use blood oxygenation level-dependent functional neuroimaging to reveal the successful restoration of functional brain connectivity in the corticostriatal and corticolimbic circuits.","Traumatic brain injury can cause long-term disability and thus constitutes a substantial healthcare burden worldwide.

392,Spatiotemporal control of signal-driven enzymatic reaction in artificial cell-like polymersomes,"Living cells can spatiotemporally control biochemical reactions to dynamically assemble membraneless organelles and remodel cytoskeleton. Herein, we present a microfluidic approach to prepare semi-permeable polymersomes comprising of amphiphilic triblock copolymer to achieve external signal-driven complex coacervation as well as biophysical reconstitution of cytoskeleton within the polymersomes. We also show that the microfluidic synthesis of polymersomes enables precise control over size, efficient encapsulation of enzymes as well as regulation of substrates without the use of biopores. Moreover, we demonstrate that the resulting triblock copolymer-based membrane in polymersomes is size-selective, allowing phosphoenol pyruvate to readily diffuse through the membrane and induce enzymatic reaction and successive coacervation or actin polymerization in the presence of pyruvate kinase and adenosine diphosphate inside the polymersomes. We envision that the Pluronic-based polymersomes presented in this work will shed light in the design of in vitro enzymatic reactions in artificial cell-like vesicles.","Researchers have been trying to mimick the cellular spatiotemporal control in normal cells with different approaches.

393,Evolution of tropical land temperature across the last glacial termination,"The tropical West Pacific hosts the warmest part of the surface ocean and has a considerable impact on the global climate system. Reconstructions of past temperature in this region can elucidate climate connections between the tropics and poles and the sensitivity of tropical temperature to greenhouse forcing. However, existing data are equivocal and reliable information from terrestrial archives is particularly sparse. Here we constrain the magnitude and timing of land temperature change in the tropical West Pacific across the last deglaciation using an exceptionally precise paleothermometer applied to a well-dated stalagmite from Northern Borneo. We show that the cave temperature increased by 4.4 ± 0.3 °C (2 SEM) from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene, amounting to 3.6 ± 0.3 °C (2 SEM) when correcting for sea-level induced cave altitude change. The warming closely follows atmospheric CO2 and Southern Hemisphere warming. This contrasts with hydroclimate, as reflected by drip water δ18O, which responds to Northern Hemisphere cooling events in the form of prominent drying, while temperature was rising. Our results thus show a close response of tropical temperature to greenhouse forcing, independent of shifts in the tropical circulation patterns.","Ancient drip water in a Borneo stalagmite reveals a strong land temperature rise across the last glacial termination in close correspondence with atmospheric CO2, and an intriguing decoupling between tropical temperature and hydroclimate.",2022-09-02
394,"Biodiversity, environmental drivers, and sustainability of the global deep-sea sponge microbiome","In the deep ocean symbioses between microbes and invertebrates are emerging as key drivers of ecosystem health and services. We present a large-scale analysis of microbial diversity in deep-sea sponges (Porifera) from scales of sponge individuals to ocean basins, covering 52 locations, 1077 host individuals translating into 169 sponge species (including understudied glass sponges), and 469 reference samples, collected anew during 21 ship-based expeditions. We demonstrate the impacts of the sponge microbial abundance status, geographic distance, sponge phylogeny, and the physical-biogeochemical environment as drivers of microbiome composition, in descending order of relevance. Our study further discloses that fundamental concepts of sponge microbiology apply robustly to sponges from the deep-sea across distances of >10,000 km. Deep-sea sponge microbiomes are less complex, yet more heterogeneous, than their shallow-water counterparts. Our analysis underscores the uniqueness of each deep-sea sponge ground based on which we provide critical knowledge for conservation of these vulnerable ecosystems.","This study presents a large-scale analysis of microbial diversity in deep-sea sponges.

395,All-fluorescence white organic light-emitting diodes with record-beating power efficiencies over 130 lm W‒1 and small roll-offs,"Improving power efficiency (PE) and reducing roll-off are of significant importance for the commercialization of white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) in consideration of energy conservation. Herein, record-beating PE of 130.7 lm W−1 and outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 31.1% are achieved in all-fluorescence two-color WOLEDs based on a simple sandwich configuration of emitting layer consisting of sky-blue and orange delayed fluorescence materials. By introducing a red fluorescence dopant, all-fluorescence three-color WOLEDs with high color rendering index are constructed based on an interlayer sensitization configuration, furnishing ultrahigh PE of 110.7 lm W−1 and EQE of 30.8%. More importantly, both two-color and three-color WOLEDs maintain excellent PEs at operating luminance with smaller roll-offs than the reported state-of-the-art WOLEDs, and further device optimization realizes outstanding comprehensive performances of low driving voltages, large luminance, high PEs and long operational lifetimes. The underlying mechanisms of the impressive device performances are elucidated by host-tuning effect and electron-trapping effect, providing useful guidance for the development of energy-conserving all-fluorescence WOLEDs.","High power efficiency and low roll-off values are essential to the commercialization of white organic light-emitting diodes.

396,Super-resolution laser probing of integrated circuits using algorithmic methods,"Laser probing remains invaluable to the semiconductor industry for isolating and diagnosing defects in silicon transistors in integrated circuits during electrical stress tests. However, continuous device miniaturization below the 20 nm technology node has crammed multiple transistors within the focal spot of the laser beam, resulting in signal crosstalk, poor beam positioning accuracy and degraded fault isolation capabilities. The challenge is analogous to focusing attention to a single speaker in a crowd despite the multiple simultaneous conversations in the background. Through algorithms introduced in this patented work, consisting of cross-correlations, clustering, and our previously developed combinational logic analysis, we achieved beam positioning accuracy to better than 10 nm, extracted electrooptic waveforms from a node of a group of transistors (~18 times beyond the optical resolution limit), and applied this to isolate and identify an actual fault on a defective device. While problems associated with probing with shorter wavelength lasers continue to be addressed, our approach enhances and enables the continued probing of ICs using sub-bandgap photon energies without hardware modification to existing technology at semiconductor technology nodes below 10 nm.","Laser probing of integrated circuits using sub-bandgap photon energies remains a challenge.

397,Protein import motor complex reacts to mitochondrial misfolding by reducing protein import and activating mitophagy,"Mitophagy is essential to maintain mitochondrial function and prevent diseases. It activates upon mitochondria depolarization, which causes PINK1 stabilization on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Strikingly, a number of conditions, including mitochondrial protein misfolding, can induce mitophagy without a loss in membrane potential. The underlying molecular details remain unclear. Here, we report that a loss of mitochondrial protein import, mediated by the pre-sequence translocase-associated motor complex PAM, is sufficient to induce mitophagy in polarized mitochondria. A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen for mitophagy inducers identifies components of the PAM complex. Protein import defects are able to induce mitophagy without a need for depolarization. Upon mitochondrial protein misfolding, PAM dissociates from the import machinery resulting in decreased protein import and mitophagy induction. Our findings extend the current mitophagy model to explain mitophagy induction upon conditions that do not affect membrane polarization, such as mitochondrial protein misfolding.","Mitophagy activation is mediated by mitochondrial depolarization. Here, the authors show that mitochondrial protein misfolding can activate mitophagy in a depolarization-independent manner mediated by a protein import reduction.",2022-09-02
398,Chimeric natural products derived from medermycin and the nature-inspired construction of their polycyclic skeletons,"Medermycin, produced by Streptomyces species, represents a family of antibiotics with significant activity against Gram-positive pathogens. The biosynthesis of this family of natural products has been studied, and new skeletons related to medermycin have rarely been reported until recently. Herein, we report eight chimeric medermycin-type natural products with unusual polycyclic skeletons. The formation of these compounds features some key nonenzymatic steps, which inspired us to construct complex polycyclic skeletons via three efficient one-step reactions under mild conditions. This strategy was further developed to efficiently synthesize analogues for biological activity studies. The synthetic compounds, chimedermycins L and M, and sekgranaticin B, show potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. This work paves the way for understanding the nonenzymatic formation of complex natural products and using it to synthesize natural product derivatives.","Nonenzymatic reactions play an important part in the formation of some natural products possessing complex skeletons.

399,Earlier ice loss accelerates lake warming in the Northern Hemisphere,"How lake temperatures across large geographic regions are responding to widespread alterations in ice phenology (i.e., the timing of seasonal ice formation and loss) remains unclear. Here, we analyse satellite data and global-scale simulations to investigate the contribution of long-term variations in the seasonality of lake ice to surface water temperature trends across the Northern Hemisphere. Our analysis suggests a widespread excess lake surface warming during the months of ice-off which is, on average, 1.4 times that calculated during the open-water season. This excess warming is influenced predominantly by an 8-day advancement in the average timing of ice break-up from 1979 to 2020. Until the permanent loss of lake ice in the future, excess lake warming may be further amplified due to projected future alterations in lake ice phenology. Excess lake warming will likely alter within-lake physical and biogeochemical processes with numerous implications for lake ecosystems.",How lake temperatures are responding to widespread changes in lake ice remains unclear. Here the authors show the excess lake warming during the ice-off and ice-on month due to earlier ice loss and later ice formation across the Northern Hemisphere.,2022-09-02
400,Microspectroscopic visualization of how biochar lifts the soil organic carbon ceiling,"The soil carbon (C) saturation concept suggests an upper limit to the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC). It is set by the mechanisms that protect soil organic matter from mineralization. Biochar has the capacity to protect new C, including rhizodeposits and microbial necromass. However, the decadal-scale mechanisms by which biochar influences the molecular diversity, spatial heterogeneity, and temporal changes in SOC persistence, remain unresolved. Here we show that the soil C storage ceiling of a Ferralsol under subtropical pasture was raised by a second application of Eucalyptus saligna biochar 8.2 years after the first application—the first application raised the soil C storage ceiling by 9.3 Mg new C ha−1 and the second application raised this by another 2.3 Mg new C ha−1. Linking direct visual evidence from one-, two-, and three-dimensional analyses with SOC quantification, we found high spatial heterogeneity of C functional groups that resulted in the retention of rhizodeposits and microbial necromass in microaggregates (53–250 µm) and the mineral fraction (<53 µm). Microbial C-use efficiency was concomitantly increased by lowering specific enzyme activities, contributing to the decreased mineralization of native SOC by 18%. We suggest that the SOC ceiling can be lifted using biochar in (sub)tropical grasslands globally.",A decadal-scale field trial revealed 1.01 Mg of rhizodeposit and necromass C was stored in soil microaggregate and mineral fractions per Mg biochar-C applied.

In this scenario, atomically thin materials are appealing because of their sensitivity to electric and magnetic gating, as well as to interlayer hybridization. Here, we introduce a radically different approach to material engineering relying on the image interaction experienced by electrons in a two-dimensional material when placed in proximity of an electrically neutral structure. We theoretically show that electrons in a semiconductor atomic layer acquire a quantum phase resulting from the image potential induced by the presence of a neighboring periodic array of conducting ribbons, which in turn modifies the optical, electrical, and thermal properties of the monolayer, giving rise to additional interband optical absorption, plasmon hybridization, and metal-insulator transitions. Beyond its fundamental interest, material engineering based on the image interaction represents a disruptive approach to tailor the properties of atomic layers for application in nanodevices.","Existing approaches to modulating the properties of 2D materials typically involve heterostructuring or exposure to external fields. Here, the authors propose a gate-free non-contact approach to tuning the properties of a 2D semiconductor via the image interaction due to proximity to a neutral patterned structure.",2022-09-02
402,Critical ionic transport across an oxygen-vacancy ordering transition,"Phase transition points can be used to critically reduce the ionic migration activation energy, which is important for realizing high-performance electrolytes at low temperatures. Here, we demonstrate a route toward low-temperature thermionic conduction in solids, by exploiting the critically lowered activation energy associated with oxygen transport in Ca-substituted bismuth ferrite (Bi1-xCaxFeO3-δ) films. Our demonstration relies on the finding that a compositional phase transition occurs by varying Ca doping ratio across xCa ≃ 0.45 between two structural phases with oxygen-vacancy channel ordering along <100> or <110> crystal axis, respectively. Regardless of the atomic-scale irregularity in defect distribution at the doping ratio, the activation energy is largely suppressed to 0.43 eV, compared with ~0.9 eV measured in otherwise rigid phases. From first-principles calculations, we propose that the effective short-range attraction between two positively charged oxygen vacancies sharing lattice deformation not only forms the defect orders but also suppresses the activation energy through concerted hopping.","Phase transition points can be used to reduce the ionic migration activation energy. Here, the authors find a lowered activation energy associated with oxygen transport at a compositional phase transition point in Ca-doped bismuth ferrite films.",2022-09-01
403,A functional vulnerability framework for biodiversity conservation,"Setting appropriate conservation strategies in a multi-threat world is a challenging goal, especially because of natural complexity and budget limitations that prevent effective management of all ecosystems. Safeguarding the most threatened ecosystems requires accurate and integrative quantification of their vulnerability and their functioning, particularly the potential loss of species trait diversity which imperils their functioning. However, the magnitude of threats and associated biological responses both have high uncertainties. Additionally, a major difficulty is the recurrent lack of reference conditions for a fair and operational measurement of vulnerability. Here, we present a functional vulnerability framework that incorporates uncertainty and reference conditions into a generalizable tool. Through in silico simulations of disturbances, our framework allows us to quantify the vulnerability of communities to a wide range of threats. We demonstrate the relevance and operationality of our framework, and its global, scalable and quantitative comparability, through three case studies on marine fishes and mammals. We show that functional vulnerability has marked geographic and temporal patterns. We underline contrasting contributions of species richness and functional redundancy to the level of vulnerability among case studies, indicating that our integrative assessment can also identify the drivers of vulnerability in a world where uncertainty is omnipresent.","At a time when protecting the environment is urgent, dealing with inherent uncertainties in the responses of biodiversity to disturbances is essential. This study promotes a promising tool to assess the vulnerability of species assemblages to guide protection efforts even if species response and disturbance regimes are poorly documented.",2022-09-01
404,Heterogeneity and transcriptome changes of human CD8+ T cells across nine decades of life,"The decline of CD8+ T cell functions contributes to deteriorating health with aging, but the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon are not well understood. We use single-cell RNA sequencing with both cross-sectional and longitudinal samples to assess how human CD8+ T cell heterogeneity and transcriptomes change over nine decades of life. Eleven subpopulations of CD8+ T cells and their dynamic changes with age are identified. Age-related changes in gene expression result from changes in the percentage of cells expressing a given transcript, quantitative changes in the transcript level, or a combination of these two. We develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the age of individual cells based on their transcriptomic features, which are closely associated with their differentiation and mutation burden. Finally, we validate this model in two separate contexts of CD8+ T cell aging: HIV infection and CAR T cell expansion in vivo.",The characterisation of T cells during aging is important to predict functional outcomes in vaccination or infection. Here the authors use flow cytometry and scRNA sequencing to transcriptionally age CD8 T cells and then use a machine learning model to interpret cell age from transcriptional profiles.,2022-09-01
405,"A compendium of 32,277 metagenome-assembled genomes and over 80 million genes from the early-life human gut microbiome","Age-specific reference genomes of the human gut microbiome can provide higher resolution for metagenomic analyses including taxonomic classification, strain-level genomic investigation and functional characterization. We present the Early-Life Gut Genomes (ELGG) catalog with 32,277 genomes representing 2172 species from 6122 fecal metagenomes collected from children under 3 years old spanning delivery mode, gestational age, feeding pattern, and geography. The ELGG substantially expanded the phylogenetic diversity by 38% over the isolate microbial genomes, and the genomic landscape of the early-life microbiome by increasing recruitment of metagenomic reads to 82.8%. More than 60% of the ELGG species lack an isolate representative. The conspecific genomes of the most abundant species from children differed in gene diversity and functions compared to adults. The ELGG genomes encode over 80 million protein sequences, forming the Early-Life Gut Proteins (ELGP) catalog with over four million protein clusters, 29.5% of which lacked functional annotations. The ELGG and ELGP references provided new insights into the early-life human gut microbiome and will facilitate studies to understand the development and mechanisms of disturbances of the human gut microbiome in early life.","Here the authors present a large-scale resource of the early-life human gut microbiome from children under three years old, which comprises 32,277 metagenome-assembled gut genomes, representing 2172 species, and more than 80 million gut proteins representing >4 million protein clusters, spanning multiple clinical factors including age, delivery mode, gestational age, and feeding patterns.",2022-09-01
406,Step-by-step state-selective tracking of fragmentation dynamics of water dications by momentum imaging,"The double photoionization of a molecule by one photon ejects two electrons and typically creates an unstable dication. Observing the subsequent fragmentation products in coincidence can reveal a surprisingly detailed picture of the dynamics. Determining the time evolution and quantum mechanical states involved leads to deeper understanding of molecular dynamics. Here in a combined experimental and theoretical study, we unambiguously separate the sequential breakup via D+ + OD+ intermediates, from other processes leading to the same D+ + D+ + O final products of double ionization of water by a single photon. Moreover, we experimentally identify, separate, and follow step by step, two pathways involving the b 1Σ+ and a 1Δ electronic states of the intermediate OD+ ion. Our classical trajectory calculations on the relevant potential energy surfaces reproduce well the measured data and, combined with the experiment, enable the determination of the internal energy and angular momentum distribution of the OD+ intermediate.","Determining the time evolution of reactions at the quantum mechanical level improves our understanding of molecular dynamics. Here, authors separate the breakup of water, one bond at a time, from other processes leading to the same final products and experimentally identify, separate, and follow step by step two breakup paths of the transient OD+ fragment.",2022-09-01
407,Proximity-magnetized quantum spin Hall insulator: monolayer 1 T’ WTe2/Cr2Ge2Te6,"Van der Waals heterostructures offer great versatility to tailor unique interactions at the atomically flat interfaces between dissimilar layered materials and induce novel physical phenomena. By bringing monolayer 1 T’ WTe2, a two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator, and few-layer Cr2Ge2Te6, an insulating ferromagnet, into close proximity in an heterostructure, we introduce a ferromagnetic order in the former via the interfacial exchange interaction. The ferromagnetism in WTe2 manifests in the anomalous Nernst effect, anomalous Hall effect as well as anisotropic magnetoresistance effect. Using local electrodes, we identify separate transport contributions from the metallic edge and insulating bulk. When driven by an AC current, the second harmonic voltage responses closely resemble the anomalous Nernst responses to AC temperature gradient generated by nonlocal heater, which appear as nonreciprocal signals with respect to the induced magnetization orientation. Our results from different electrodes reveal spin-polarized edge states in the magnetized quantum spin Hall insulator.","Van der Waals heterostructures allow for the integration of several materials with different properties in the one heterostructure. Here, Li et al combine a quantum spin hall insulator, WTe2, with an insulating ferromagnet, Cr2Ge2Te6, in a van der Waals heterostructure, with resulting proximity-induced magnetism in the WTe2 layer leading to an anomalous Hall and Nernst effect.",2022-09-01
408,Global patterns of vascular plant alpha diversity,"Global patterns of regional (gamma) plant diversity are relatively well known, but whether these patterns hold for local communities, and the dependence on spatial grain, remain controversial. Using data on 170,272 georeferenced local plant assemblages, we created global maps of alpha diversity (local species richness) for vascular plants at three different spatial grains, for forests and non-forests. We show that alpha diversity is consistently high across grains in some regions (for example, Andean-Amazonian foothills), but regional ‘scaling anomalies’ (deviations from the positive correlation) exist elsewhere, particularly in Eurasian temperate forests with disproportionally higher fine-grained richness and many African tropical forests with disproportionally higher coarse-grained richness. The influence of different climatic, topographic and biogeographical variables on alpha diversity also varies across grains. Our multi-grain maps return a nuanced understanding of vascular plant biodiversity patterns that complements classic maps of biodiversity hotspots and will improve predictions of global change effects on biodiversity.","Global patterns of regional plant diversity are relatively well known, but whether they hold for local communities is debated. This study created multi-grain global maps of alpha diversity for vascular plants to provide a nuanced understanding of plant diversity hotspots and improve predictions of global change effects on biodiversity.",2022-09-01
409,WAVY GROWTH Arabidopsis E3 ubiquitin ligases affect apical PIN sorting decisions,"Directionality in the intercellular transport of the plant hormone auxin is determined by polar plasma membrane localization of PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin transport proteins. However, apart from PIN phosphorylation at conserved motifs, no further determinants explicitly controlling polar PIN sorting decisions have been identified. Here we present Arabidopsis WAVY GROWTH 3 (WAV3) and closely related RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligases, whose loss-of-function mutants show a striking apical-to-basal polarity switch in PIN2 localization in root meristem cells. WAV3 E3 ligases function as essential determinants for PIN polarity, acting independently from PINOID/WAG-dependent PIN phosphorylation. They antagonize ectopic deposition of de novo synthesized PIN proteins already immediately following completion of cell division, presumably via preventing PIN sorting into basal, ARF GEF-mediated trafficking. Our findings reveal an involvement of E3 ligases in the selective targeting of apically localized PINs in higher plants.",Directionality of auxin transport is determined by polar localization of PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins. Here the authors show that Arabidopsis WAV3 E3 ubiquitin ligases contribute to PIN polarity by selectively antagonizing ectopic deposition of de novo synthesized PIN proteins following cell division.,2022-09-01
410,Microspheres from light—a sustainable materials platform,"Driven by the demand for highly specialized polymeric materials via milder, safer, and sustainable processes, we herein introduce a powerful, purely light driven platform for microsphere synthesis – including facile synthesis by sunlight. Our light-induced step-growth precipitation polymerization produces monodisperse particles (0.4–2.4 μm) at ambient temperature without any initiator, surfactant, additive or heating, constituting an unconventional approach compared to the classically thermally driven synthesis of particles. The microspheres are formed via the Diels-Alder cycloaddition of a photoactive monomer (2-methylisophthaldialdehyde, MIA) and a suitable electron deficient dienophile (bismaleimide). The particles are stable in the dry state as well as in solution and their surface can be further functionalized to produce fluorescent particles or alter their hydrophilicity. The simplicity and versatility of our approach introduces a fresh opportunity for particle synthesis, opening access to a yet unknown material class.","Photopolymerization provides a safe and mild fabrication pathway towards polymeric particles but the implementation of photochemistry from solution to dispersed media to produce particles is far from trivial. Here, the authors demonstrate an additive-free step-growth photopolymerization with sunlight, exploiting the photoinduced Diels-Alder to fabricate micrometer sized polymeric particles.",2022-09-01
411,A compact cold-atom interferometer with a high data-rate grating magneto-optical trap and a photonic-integrated-circuit-compatible laser system,"The extreme miniaturization of a cold-atom interferometer accelerometer requires the development of novel technologies and architectures for the interferometer subsystems. Here, we describe several component technologies and a laser system architecture to enable a path to such miniaturization. We developed a custom, compact titanium vacuum package containing a microfabricated grating chip for a tetrahedral grating magneto-optical trap (GMOT) using a single cooling beam. In addition, we designed a multi-channel photonic-integrated-circuit-compatible laser system implemented with a single seed laser and single sideband modulators in a time-multiplexed manner, reducing the number of optical channels connected to the sensor head. In a compact sensor head containing the vacuum package, sub-Doppler cooling in the GMOT produces 15 μK temperatures, and the GMOT can operate at a 20 Hz data rate. We validated the atomic coherence with Ramsey interferometry using microwave spectroscopy, then demonstrated a light-pulse atom interferometer in a gravimeter configuration for a 10 Hz measurement data rate and T = 0–4.5 ms interrogation time, resulting in Δg/g = 2.0 × 10−6. This work represents a significant step towards deployable cold-atom inertial sensors under large amplitude motional dynamics.",Cold-atom interferometers have been miniaturized towards fieldable quantum inertial sensing applications.

412,A gene cluster in Ginkgo biloba encodes unique multifunctional cytochrome P450s that initiate ginkgolide biosynthesis,"The ginkgo tree (Ginkgo biloba) is considered a living fossil due to its 200 million year’s history under morphological stasis. Its resilience is partly attributed to its unique set of specialized metabolites, in particular, ginkgolides and bilobalide, which are chemically complex terpene trilactones. Here, we use a gene cluster-guided mining approach in combination with co-expression analysis to reveal the primary steps in ginkgolide biosynthesis. We show that five multifunctional cytochrome P450s with atypical catalytic activities generate the tert-butyl group and one of the lactone rings, characteristic of all G. biloba trilactone terpenoids. The reactions include scarless C–C bond cleavage as well as carbon skeleton rearrangement (NIH shift) occurring on a previously unsuspected intermediate. The cytochrome P450s belong to CYP families that diversifies in pre-seed plants and gymnosperms, but are not preserved in angiosperms. Our work uncovers the early ginkgolide pathway and offers a glance into the biosynthesis of terpenoids of the Mesozoic Era.","Although ginkgo terpenoids have been studied extensively for their pharmaceutical properties, knowledge on their biosynthesis remains limited. Here, the authors identify five multifunctional cytochrome P450s that catalyze the generation of the tert-butyl group and one of the lactone rings towards the biosynthesis of ginkgolides.",2022-09-01
413,Deep learning for twelve hour precipitation forecasts,"Existing weather forecasting models are based on physics and use supercomputers to evolve the atmosphere into the future. Better physics-based forecasts require improved atmospheric models, which can be difficult to discover and develop, or increasing the resolution underlying the simulation, which can be computationally prohibitive. An emerging class of weather models based on neural networks overcome these limitations by learning the required transformations from data instead of relying on hand-coded physics and by running efficiently in parallel. Here we present a neural network capable of predicting precipitation at a high resolution up to 12 h ahead. The model predicts raw precipitation targets and outperforms for up to 12 h of lead time state-of-the-art physics-based models currently operating in the Continental United States. The results represent a substantial step towards validating the new class of neural weather models.",Can AI learn from atmospheric data and improve weather forecasting?

414,SARS-CoV-2 vaccination induces mucosal antibody responses in previously infected individuals,"Immune responses at the respiratory mucosal interface are critical to prevent respiratory infections but it is unclear to what extent antigen specific mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA) antibodies are induced by mRNA vaccination in humans. Here we analyze paired serum and saliva samples from patients with and without prior coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at multiple time points pre and post severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccination. Our results suggest mucosal SIgA responses induced by mRNA vaccination are impacted by pre-existing immunity. Indeed, vaccination induced a minimal mucosal SIgA response in individuals without pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 while SIgA induction after vaccination was more efficient in patients with a history of COVID-19.",Prior exposure to infectious agents can impact the vaccination induced immune response. Here the authors show prior SARS-CoV-2 infection results in more efficient induction of mucosal SARS-CoV-2 secretory IgA antibody following mRNA vaccination.,2022-09-01
415,Context-dependent function of TSLP and IL-1β in skin allergic sensitization and atopic march,"Atopic diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma, affect a large proportion of the population, with increasing prevalence worldwide. AD often precedes the development of asthma, known as the atopic march. Allergen sensitization developed through the barrier-defective skin of AD has been recognized to be a critical step leading to asthma, in which thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) was previously shown to be critical. In this study, using a laser-assistant microporation system to disrupt targeted skin layers for generating micropores at a precise anatomic depth of mouse skin, we model allergen exposure superficially or deeply in the skin, leading to epicutaneous sensitization or dermacutaneous sensitization that is associated with a different cytokine microenvironment. Our work shows a differential requirement for TSLP in these two contexts, and identifies an important function for IL-1β, which is independent of TSLP, in promoting allergen sensitization and subsequent allergic asthma.","Allergic sensitisation in the skin can lead to allergic dermatitis and further to airway asthma in a process of atopic march. Here the authors examine the difference between superficial or deep skin sensitisation, characterise the immune cells generated and show differential TSLP and IL-1β involvement.",2022-09-01
416,Bacteria loaded with glucose polymer and photosensitive ICG silicon-nanoparticles for glioblastoma photothermal immunotherapy,"Bacteria can bypass the blood-brain barrier (BBB), suggesting the possibility of employment of bacteria for combating central nervous system diseases. Herein, we develop a bacteria-based drug delivery system for glioblastoma (GBM) photothermal immunotherapy. The system, which we name as ‘Trojan bacteria’, consists of bacteria loaded with glucose polymer and photosensitive ICG silicon-nanoparticles. In an orthotopic GBM mouse model, we demonstrate that the intravenously injected bacteria bypass the BBB, targeting and penetrating GBM tissues. Upon 808 nm-laser irradiation, the photothermal effects produced by ICG allow the destruction of bacterial cells and the adjacent tumour cells. Furthermore, the bacterial debris as well as the tumour-associated antigens promote antitumor immune responses that prolong the survival of GBM-bearing mice. Moreover, we demonstrate the residual bacteria are effectively eliminated from the body, supporting the potential therapeutic use of this system.","Different blood-brain barrier permeable systems, such as bacteria loaded with chemotherapy, have been proposed to treat glioblastoma. Here, the authors generate bacteria loaded with glucose polymer and photosensitive ICG silicon-nanoparticles to eliminate bacteria-infected glioblastoma cells and induce an anti-tumour immune response upon photothermal therapy.",2022-09-01
417,Decoding the olfactory map through targeted transcriptomics links murine olfactory receptors to glomeruli,"Sensory processing in olfactory systems is organized across olfactory bulb glomeruli, wherein axons of peripheral sensory neurons expressing the same olfactory receptor co-terminate to transmit receptor-specific activity to central neurons. Understanding how receptors map to glomeruli is therefore critical to understanding olfaction. High-throughput spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly advancing field, but low-abundance olfactory receptor expression within glomeruli has previously precluded high-throughput mapping of receptors to glomeruli in the mouse. Here we combined sequential sectioning along the anteroposterior, dorsoventral, and mediolateral axes with target capture enrichment sequencing to overcome low-abundance target expression. This strategy allowed us to spatially map 86% of olfactory receptors across the olfactory bulb and uncover a relationship between OR sequence and glomerular position.","Targeted spatial transcriptomics mapped olfactory receptor mRNAs to sections of the murine olfactory bulb to generate an interactive, statistical, 3D model of glomeruli locations and identify an ultra-sensitive receptor-odorant relationship.",2022-09-01
418,Climate and land management accelerate the Brazilian water cycle,"Increasing floods and droughts are raising concerns of an accelerating water cycle, however, the relative contributions to streamflow changes from climate and land management have not been assessed at the continental scale. We analyze streamflow data in major South American tropical river basins and show that water use and deforestation have amplified climate change effects on streamflow extremes over the past four decades. Drying (fewer floods and more droughts) is aligned with decreasing rainfall and increasing water use in agricultural zones and occurs in 42% of the study area. Acceleration (both more severe floods and droughts) is related to more extreme rainfall and deforestation and occurs in 29% of the study area, including southern Amazonia. The regionally accelerating water cycle may have adverse global impacts on carbon sequestration and food security.","Increasing floods and droughts are raising concerns of an accelerating water cycle. A new study shows that the terrestrial water cycle in Brazil has been mostly drying or accelerating, aligned with changes in rainfall, water use, and forest cover.",2022-09-01
419,Percolation transition prescribes protein size-specific barrier to passive transport through the nuclear pore complex,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) control biomolecular transport in and out of the nucleus. Disordered nucleoporins in the complex’s pore form a permeation barrier, preventing unassisted transport of large biomolecules. Here, we combine coarse-grained simulations of experimentally derived NPC structures with a theoretical model to determine the microscopic mechanism of passive transport. Brute-force simulations of protein transport reveal telegraph-like behavior, where prolonged diffusion on one side of the NPC is interrupted by rapid crossings to the other. We rationalize this behavior using a theoretical model that reproduces the energetics and kinetics of permeation solely from statistics of transient voids within the disordered mesh. As the protein size increases, the mesh transforms from a soft to a hard barrier, enabling orders-of-magnitude reduction in permeation rate for proteins beyond the percolation size threshold. Our model enables exploration of alternative NPC architectures and sets the stage for uncovering molecular mechanisms of facilitated nuclear transport.","Combining realistic coarse-grained simulations with a percolation transition theory, this study elucidates the microscopic mechanism that governs the selectivity of passive, unassisted transport through the nuclear pore complex.",2022-09-01
420,Crosstalk between SUMOylation and ubiquitylation controls DNA end resection by maintaining MRE11 homeostasis on chromatin,"DNA end resection is delicately regulated through various types of post-translational modifications to initiate homologous recombination, but the involvement of SUMOylation in this process remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that MRE11 requires SUMOylation to shield it from ubiquitin-mediated degradation when resecting damaged chromatin. Upon DSB induction, PIAS1 promotes MRE11 SUMOylation on chromatin to initiate DNA end resection. Then, MRE11 is deSUMOylated by SENP3 mainly after it has moved away from DSB sites. SENP3 deficiency results in MRE11 degradation failure and accumulation on chromatin, causing genome instability. We further show that cancer-related MRE11 mutants with impaired SUMOylation exhibit compromised DNA repair ability. Thus, we demonstrate that MRE11 SUMOylation in coordination with ubiquitylation is dynamically controlled by PIAS1 and SENP3 to facilitate DNA end resection and maintain genome stability.","DNA end resection initiating DNA repair by homologous recombination needs to be delicately regulated. This study shows the interplay between SUMOylation and ubiquitylation maintains MRE11 homeostasis on chromatin, thus facilitating genome stability.",2022-09-01
421,Genetic analyses of the electrocardiographic QT interval and its components identify additional loci and pathways,"The QT interval is an electrocardiographic measure representing the sum of ventricular depolarization and repolarization, estimated by QRS duration and JT interval, respectively. QT interval abnormalities are associated with potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Using genome-wide multi-ancestry analyses (>250,000 individuals) we identify 177, 156 and 121 independent loci for QT, JT and QRS, respectively, including a male-specific X-chromosome locus. Using gene-based rare-variant methods, we identify associations with Mendelian disease genes. Enrichments are observed in established pathways for QT and JT, and previously unreported genes indicated in insulin-receptor signalling and cardiac energy metabolism. In contrast for QRS, connective tissue components and processes for cell growth and extracellular matrix interactions are significantly enriched. We demonstrate polygenic risk score associations with atrial fibrillation, conduction disease and sudden cardiac death. Prioritization of druggable genes highlight potential therapeutic targets for arrhythmia. Together, these results substantially advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of ventricular depolarization and repolarization.","The QT interval is a heritable electrocardiographic measure associated with arrhythmia risk when prolonged. Here, the authors used a series of genetic analyses to identify genetic loci, pathways, therapeutic targets, and relationships with cardiovascular disease.",2022-09-01
422,Reproducibility of real-world evidence studies using clinical practice data to inform regulatory and coverage decisions,"Studies that generate real-world evidence on the effects of medical products through analysis of digital data collected in clinical practice provide key insights for regulators, payers, and other healthcare decision-makers. Ensuring reproducibility of such findings is fundamental to effective evidence-based decision-making. We reproduce results for 150 studies published in peer-reviewed journals using the same healthcare databases as original investigators and evaluate the completeness of reporting for 250. Original and reproduction effect sizes were positively correlated (Pearson’s correlation = 0.85), a strong relationship with some room for improvement. The median and interquartile range for the relative magnitude of effect (e.g., hazard ratiooriginal/hazard ratioreproduction) is 1.0 [0.9, 1.1], range [0.3, 2.1]. While the majority of results are closely reproduced, a subset are not. The latter can be explained by incomplete reporting and updated data. Greater methodological transparency aligned with new guidance may further improve reproducibility and validity assessment, thus facilitating evidence-based decision-making. Study registration number: EUPAS19636.","Analyses of real-world evidence from digital clinical practice data provide important insights for healthcare decision makers.

423,Smart low interfacial toughness coatings for on-demand de-icing without melting,"Ice accretion causes problems in vital industries and has been addressed over the past decades with either passive or active de-icing systems. This work presents a smart, hybrid (passive and active) de-icing system through the combination of a low interfacial toughness coating, printed circuit board heaters, and an ice-detecting microwave sensor. The coating’s interfacial toughness with ice is found to be temperature dependent and can be modulated using the embedded heaters. Accordingly, de-icing is realized without melting the interface. The synergistic combination of the low interfacial toughness coating and periodic heaters results in a greater de-icing power density than a full-coverage heater system. The hybrid de-icing system also shows durability towards repeated icing/de-icing, mechanical abrasion, outdoor exposure, and chemical contamination. A non-contact planar microwave resonator sensor is additionally designed and implemented to precisely detect the presence or absence of water or ice on the surface while operating beneath the coating, further enhancing the system’s energy efficiency. Scalability of the smart coating is demonstrated using large (up to 1 m) iced interfaces. Overall, the smart hybrid system designed here offers a paradigm shift in de-icing that can efficiently render a surface ice-free without the need for energetically expensive interface melting.","Removing ice from surfaces typically requires melting. Nonetheless, authors demonstrate a smart low interfacial toughness coating integrated with underlying heaters and ice-detecting microwave sensors that enable energy efficient smart large-scale de-icing without melting.",2022-08-31
424,Structural basis of ion uptake in copper-transporting P1B-type ATPases,"Copper is essential for living cells, yet toxic at elevated concentrations. Class 1B P-type (P1B-) ATPases are present in all kingdoms of life, facilitating cellular export of transition metals including copper. P-type ATPases follow an alternating access mechanism, with inward-facing E1 and outward-facing E2 conformations. Nevertheless, no structural information on E1 states is available for P1B-ATPases, hampering mechanistic understanding. Here, we present structures that reach 2.7 Å resolution of a copper-specific P1B-ATPase in an E1 conformation, with complementing data and analyses. Our efforts reveal a domain arrangement that generates space for interaction with ion donating chaperones, and suggest a direct Cu+ transfer to the transmembrane core. A methionine serves a key role by assisting the release of the chaperone-bound ion and forming a cargo entry site together with the cysteines of the CPC signature motif. Collectively, the findings provide insights into P1B-mediated transport, likely applicable also to human P1B-members.","P1B-type ATPases export excess transition metals from cells.

425,Structural and mechanistic basis for recognition of alternative tRNA precursor substrates by bacterial ribonuclease P,"Binding of precursor tRNAs (ptRNAs) by bacterial ribonuclease P (RNase P) involves an encounter complex (ES) that isomerizes to a catalytic conformation (ES*). However, the structures of intermediates and the conformational changes that occur during binding are poorly understood. Here, we show that pairing between the 5′ leader and 3′RCCA extending the acceptor stem of ptRNA inhibits ES* formation. Cryo-electron microscopy single particle analysis reveals a dynamic enzyme that becomes ordered upon formation of ES* in which extended acceptor stem pairing is unwound. Comparisons of structures with alternative ptRNAs reveals that once unwinding is completed RNase P primarily uses stacking interactions and shape complementarity to accommodate alternative sequences at its cleavage site. Our study reveals active site interactions and conformational changes that drive molecular recognition by RNase P and lays the foundation for understanding how binding interactions are linked to helix unwinding and catalysis.","Ribonuclease P efficiently processes all tRNA precursors despite sequence variation at the site of cleavage. Here, authors use high-throughput enzymology and cryoEM to reveal conformational changes that drive recognition by bacterial RNase P.",2022-08-31
426,The emerging role of drought as a regulator of dissolved organic carbon in boreal landscapes,"One likely consequence of global climate change is an increased frequency and intensity of droughts at high latitudes. Here we use a 17-year record from 13 nested boreal streams to examine direct and lagged effects of summer drought on the quantity and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) inputs from catchment soils. Protracted periods of drought reduced DOC concentrations in all catchments but also led to large stream DOC pulses upon rewetting. Concurrent changes in DOC optical properties and chemical character suggest that seasonal drying and rewetting trigger soil processes that alter the forms of carbon supplied to streams. Contrary to expectations, clearest drought effects were observed in larger watersheds, whereas responses were most muted in smaller, peatland-dominated catchments. Collectively, our results indicate that summer drought causes a fundamental shift in the seasonal distribution of DOC concentrations and character, which together operate as primary controls over the ecological and biogeochemical functioning of northern aquatic ecosystems.",Long-term records from boreal streams indicate strong seasonal redistributions of dissolved organic carbon concentrations and quality linked to the severity of summer drought conditions,2022-08-31
427,OXTRHigh stroma fibroblasts control the invasion pattern of oral squamous cell carcinoma via ERK5 signaling,"The Pattern Of Invasion (POI) of tumor cells into adjacent normal tissues clinically predicts postoperative tumor metastasis/recurrence of early oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), but the mechanisms underlying the development of these subtypes remain unclear. Focusing on the highest score of POIs (Worst POI, WPOI) present within each tumor, we observe a disease progression-driven shift of WPOI towards the high-risk type 4/5, associated with a mesenchymal phenotype in advanced OSCC. WPOI 4-5-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFsWPOI4-5), characterized by high oxytocin receptor expression (OXTRHigh), contribute to local-regional metastasis. OXTRHigh CAFs induce a desmoplastic stroma and CCL26 is required for the invasive phenotype of CCR3+ tumors. Mechanistically, OXTR activates nuclear ERK5 transcription signaling via Gαq and CDC37 to maintain high levels of OXTR and CCL26. ERK5 ablation reprograms the pro-invasive phenotype of OXTRHigh CAFs. Therefore, targeting ERK5 signaling in OXTRHigh CAFs is a potential therapeutic strategy for OSCC patients with WPOI 4-5.",Worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) is a parameter used to quantify tumor invasiveness of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Here the authors show that a fibroblast subset characterized by the expression of the oxytocin receptor is enriched in highly invasive WPOI 4-5 OSCC tumors and can be targeted to reduce the desmoplastic stroma and tumor metastasis.,2022-08-31
428,Enhanced polarization and abnormal flexural deformation in bent freestanding perovskite oxides,"Recent realizations of ultrathin freestanding perovskite oxides offer a unique platform to probe novel properties in two-dimensional oxides. Here, we observe a giant flexoelectric response in freestanding BiFeO3 and SrTiO3 in their bent state arising from strain gradients up to 3.5 × 107 m−1, suggesting a promising approach for realizing ultra-large polarizations. Additionally, a substantial change in membrane thickness is discovered in bent freestanding BiFeO3, which implies an unusual bending-expansion/shrinkage effect in the ferroelectric membrane that has never been seen before in crystalline materials. Our theoretical model reveals that this unprecedented flexural deformation within the membrane is attributable to a flexoelectricity–piezoelectricity interplay. The finding unveils intriguing nanoscale electromechanical properties and provides guidance for their practical applications in flexible nanoelectromechanical systems.","Freestanding perovskite oxides pave the way to novel flexural properties. Here, the authors observe the nanoscale strain gradient induced flexoelectric polarization with an unusual flexo-expansion/shrinkage effect in freestanding ferroelectric oxide.",2022-08-31
429,Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to alcohols by modulating the molecular geometry and Cu coordination in bicentric copper complexes,"Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into alcohols of high economic value offers a promising route to realize resourceful CO2 utilization. In this study, we choose three model bicentric copper complexes based on the expanded and fluorinated porphyrin structure, but different spatial and coordination geometry, to unravel their structure-property-performance correlation in catalyzing electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions. We show that the complexes with higher intramolecular tension and coordination asymmetry manifests a lower electrochemical stability and thus more active Cu centers, which can be reduced during electrolysis to form Cu clusters accompanied by partially-reduced or fragmented ligands. We demonstrate the hybrid structure of Cu cluster and partially reduced O-containing hexaphyrin ligand is highly potent in converting CO2 into alcohols, up to 32.5% ethanol and 18.3% n-propanol in Faradaic efficiencies that have been rarely reported. More importantly, we uncover an interplay between the inorganic and organic phases to synergistically produce alcohols, of which the intermediates are stabilized by a confined space to afford extra O-Cu bonding. This study underlines the exploitation of structure-dependent electrochemical property to steer the CO2 reduction pathway, as well as a potential generic tactic to target alcohol synthesis by constructing organic/inorganic Cu hybrids.",Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into multi-carbon alcohols of high economic merit offers an effective means to close the carbon cycle. Here the authors show the synergy between inorganic and organic phases derived from rationally designed molecular precursors to produce alcohols in high efficiency.,2022-08-31
430,Large contribution of fossil-derived components to aqueous secondary organic aerosols in China,"Incomplete understanding of the sources of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) leads to large uncertainty in both air quality management and in climate change assessment. Chemical reactions occurring in the atmospheric aqueous phase represent an important source of SOA mass, yet, the effects of anthropogenic emissions on the aqueous SOA (aqSOA) are not well constrained. Here we use compound-specific dual-carbon isotopic fingerprints (δ13C and Δ14C) of dominant aqSOA molecules, such as oxalic acid, to track the precursor sources and formation mechanisms of aqSOA. Substantial stable carbon isotope fractionation of aqSOA molecules provides robust evidence for extensive aqueous-phase processing. Contrary to the paradigm that these aqSOA compounds are largely biogenic, radiocarbon-based source apportionments show that fossil precursors produced over one-half of the aqSOA molecules. Large fractions of fossil-derived aqSOA contribute substantially to the total water-soluble organic aerosol load and hence impact projections of both air quality and anthropogenic radiative forcing. Our findings reveal the importance of fossil emissions for aqSOA with effects on climate and air quality.","Isotope fingerprinting is used to track precursor sources and formation pathways of aqueous SOA, such as oxalic acid, finding that fossil fuel precursors contributions have largely been underestimated.",2022-08-31
431,PD-L2 controls peripherally induced regulatory T cells by maintaining metabolic activity and Foxp3 stability,"Regulatory T (Treg) cells are central to limit immune responses to allergens. Here we show that PD-L2 deficiency prevents the induction of tolerance to ovalbumin and control of airway hyperreactivity, in particular by limiting pTreg numbers and function. In vitro, PD-1/PD-L2 interactions increase iTreg numbers and stability. In mice lacking PD-L2 we find lower numbers of splenic pTregs at steady state, producing less IL-10 upon activation and with reduced suppressive activity. Remarkably, the numbers of splenic pTregs are restored by adoptively transferring PD-L2high dendritic cells to PD-L2KO mice. Functionally, activated pTregs lacking PD-L2 show lower Foxp3 expression, higher methylation of the Treg-Specific Demethylation Region (TSDR) and a decreased Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle associated with a defect in mitochondrial function and ATP production. Consequently, pyruvate treatment of PD-L2KO mice partially restores IL-10 production and airway tolerance. Together, our study highlights the importance of the PD-1/PD-L2 axis in the control of metabolic pathways regulating pTreg Foxp3 stability and suppressive functions, opening up avenues to further improve mucosal immunotherapy.","Regulatory T (Treg) cells have been implicated in the induction of airway tolerance and amelioration of respiratory duct inflammation. Here the authors show, using PD-L2 deficient mice, that the immune suppression signal from PD-L2 is important for modulating Treg cell metabolism and function for proper induction of respiratory tolerance in mice.",2022-08-31
432,Coherent terahertz radiation with 2.8-octave tunability through chip-scale photomixed microresonator optical parametric oscillation,"High-spectral-purity frequency-agile room-temperature sources in the terahertz spectrum are foundational elements for imaging, sensing, metrology, and communications. Here we present a chip-scale optical parametric oscillator based on an integrated nonlinear microresonator that provides broadly tunable single-frequency and multi-frequency oscillators in the terahertz regime. Through optical-to-terahertz down-conversion using a plasmonic nanoantenna array, coherent terahertz radiation spanning 2.8-octaves is achieved from 330 GHz to 2.3 THz, with ≈20 GHz cavity-mode-limited frequency tuning step and ≈10 MHz intracavity-mode continuous frequency tuning range at each step. By controlling the microresonator intracavity power and pump-resonance detuning, tunable multi-frequency terahertz oscillators are also realized. Furthermore, by stabilizing the microresonator pump power and wavelength, sub-100 Hz linewidth of the terahertz radiation with 10−15 residual frequency instability is demonstrated. The room-temperature generation of both single-frequency, frequency-agile terahertz radiation and multi-frequency terahertz oscillators in the chip-scale platform offers unique capabilities in metrology, sensing, imaging and communications.","High-spectral-purity frequency-agile room-temperature THz sources are foundational elements for imaging, sensing, metrology, and communications. Here a parametric oscillator-photomixer chip with coherent 2.8-octave tunable THz radiation is achieved.",2022-08-31
433,Structured sonic tube with carbon nanotube-like topological edge states,"A single-wall carbon nanotube can be viewed as a one-dimensional material created by rolling up a sheet of graphene. Its electronic band structure depends on the chirality, i.e., how the sheet has been rolled up, yet synthesizing the symmetry at will is rather challenging. We structure an artificial honeycomb lattice in both a zigzag and an armchair tube and explore their topological features for sound. Our findings reveal how armchair tubes remain gapless, whereas the zigzag counterparts host nontrivial edge states of non-zero quantized Zak phase, which are dictated by the circumferential number of units. Unlike man-made planar lattices whose underling symmetry must be broken to harvest quantum Hall and pseudospin phases, interestingly, the structured tubular lattice symmetry remains intact, while its nontrivial phase alone is governed by the chirality and the tube diameter. We foresee that our results, not only for sound, but also in photonics, mechanics and electronics will broaden future avenues for fundamental and applied sciences.","Single-wall carbon nanotubes are made of carbon with diameters less than 100 nanometers. Here, the authors engineer an analogue tube with a diameter 1,000,000 times larger with the aim to explore topological properties including unusual acoustic edge states.",2022-08-30
434,Double-crowned 2D semiconductor nanoplatelets with bicolor power-tunable emission,"Nanocrystals (NCs) are now established building blocks for optoelectronics and their use as down converters for large gamut displays has been their first mass market. NC integration relies on a combination of green and red NCs into a blend, which rises post-growth formulation issues. A careful engineering of the NCs may enable dual emissions from a single NC population which violates Kasha’s rule, which stipulates that emission should occur at the band edge. Thus, in addition to an attentive control of band alignment to obtain green and red signals, non-radiative decay paths also have to be carefully slowed down to enable emission away from the ground state. Here, we demonstrate that core/crown/crown 2D nanoplatelets (NPLs), made of CdSe/CdTe/CdSe, can combine a large volume and a type-II band alignment enabling simultaneously red and narrow green emissions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the ratio of the two emissions can be tuned by the incident power, which results in a saturation of the red emission due to non-radiative Auger recombination that affects this emission much stronger than the green one. Finally, we also show that dual-color, power tunable, emission can be obtained through an electrical excitation.","Nanocrystals are desirable light sources for advanced display technologies. Here, the authors report on double-crowned 2D semiconductor nanoplatelets as light downconverters that offer both green and red emissions to achieve a wide color gamut.",2022-08-30
435,Comprehensive structural assignment of glycosaminoglycan oligo- and polysaccharides by protein nanopore,"Glycosaminoglycans are highly anionic functional polysaccharides with information content in their structure that plays a major role in the communication between the cell and the extracellular environment. The study presented here reports the label-free detection and analysis of glycosaminoglycan molecules at the single molecule level using sensing by biological nanopore, thus addressing the need to decipher structural information in oligo- and polysaccharide sequences, which remains a major challenge for glycoscience. We demonstrate that a wild-type aerolysin nanopore can detect and characterize glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharides with various sulfate patterns, osidic bonds and epimers of uronic acid residues. Size discrimination of tetra- to icosasaccharides from heparin, chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate was investigated and we show that different contents and distributions of sulfate groups can be detected. Remarkably, differences in α/β anomerization and 1,4/1,3 osidic linkages can also be detected in heparosan and hyaluronic acid, as well as the subtle difference between the glucuronic/iduronic epimers in chondroitin and dermatan sulfate. Although, at this stage, discrimination of each of the constituent units of GAGs is not yet achieved at the single-molecule level, the resolution reached in this study is an essential step toward this ultimate goal.","Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are highly anionic functional polysaccharides with subtle structural variations that are very difficult to differentiate. Here the authors demonstrate proof-of-concept single-molecule detection by nanopore, taking a first step towards the ultimate goal of GAG sequencing.",2022-08-30
436,Tackling recalcitrant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in critical illness via anti-virulence monotherapy,"Intestinal barrier derangement allows intestinal bacteria and their products to translocate to the systemic circulation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) superimposed infection in critically ill patients increases gut permeability and leads to gut-driven sepsis. PA infections are challenging due to multi-drug resistance (MDR), biofilms, and/or antibiotic tolerance. Inhibition of the quorum-sensing transcriptional regulator MvfR(PqsR) is a desirable anti-PA anti-virulence strategy as MvfR controls multiple acute and chronic virulence functions. Here we show that MvfR promotes intestinal permeability and report potent anti-MvfR compounds, the N-Aryl Malonamides (NAMs), resulting from extensive structure-activity-relationship studies and thorough assessment of the inhibition of MvfR-controlled virulence functions. This class of anti-virulence non-native ligand-based agents has a half-maximal inhibitory concentration in the nanomolar range and strong target engagement. Using a NAM lead in monotherapy protects murine intestinal barrier function, abolishes MvfR-regulated small molecules, ameliorates bacterial dissemination, and lowers inflammatory cytokines. This study demonstrates the importance of MvfR in PA-driven intestinal permeability. It underscores the utility of anti-MvfR agents in maintaining gut mucosal integrity, which should be part of any successful strategy to prevent/treat PA infections and associated gut-derived sepsis in critical illness settings. NAMs provide for the development of crucial preventive/therapeutic monotherapy options against untreatable MDR PA infections.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are increasingly difficult to treat due to the development of antimicrobial resistance.

437,Single-cell transcriptome and translatome dual-omics reveals potential mechanisms of human oocyte maturation,"The combined use of transcriptome and translatome as indicators of gene expression profiles is usually more accurate than the use of transcriptomes alone, especially in cell types governed by translational regulation, such as mammalian oocytes. Here, we developed a dual-omics methodology that includes both transcriptome and translatome sequencing (T&T-seq) of single-cell oocyte samples, and we used it to characterize the transcriptomes and translatomes during mouse and human oocyte maturation. T&T-seq analysis revealed distinct translational expression patterns between mouse and human oocytes and delineated a sequential gene expression regulation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during human oocyte maturation. By these means, we also identified a functional role of OOSP2 inducing factor in human oocyte maturation, as human recombinant OOSP2 induced in vitro maturation of human oocytes, which was blocked by anti-OOSP2. Single-oocyte T&T-seq analyses further elucidated that OOSP2 induces specific signaling pathways, including small GTPases, through translational regulation.","Development of methods for simultaneous single cell analysis of transcription and translation is still underway. Here, Hu et al. develop single-cell transcriptome and translatome dual-omics on human oocytes, which enables them to identify OOSP2 as an induction factor during human oocyte maturation.",2022-08-30
438,Precursor engineering of hydrotalcite-derived redox sorbents for reversible and stable thermochemical oxygen storage,"Chemical looping processes based on multiple-step reduction and oxidation of metal oxides hold great promise for a variety of energy applications, such as CO2 capture and conversion, gas separation, energy storage, and redox catalytic processes. Copper-based mixed oxides are one of the most promising candidate materials with a high oxygen storage capacity. However, the structural deterioration and sintering at high temperatures is one key scientific challenge. Herein, we report a precursor engineering approach to prepare durable copper-based redox sorbents for use in thermochemical looping processes for combustion and gas purification. Calcination of the CuMgAl hydrotalcite precursors formed mixed metal oxides consisting of CuO nanoparticles dispersed in the Mg-Al oxide support which inhibited the formation of copper aluminates during redox cycling. The copper-based redox sorbents demonstrated enhanced reaction rates, stable O2 storage capacity over 500 redox cycles at 900 °C, and efficient gas purification over a broad temperature range. We expect that our materials design strategy has broad implications on synthesis and engineering of mixed metal oxides for a range of thermochemical processes and redox catalytic applications.","Thermochemical redox reactions of metal oxides are promising for CO2 capture, gas purification, air separation, and energy storage. Here, the authors report mixed metal oxides derived from layered double hydroxides precursors, and demonstrate their reversible and stable thermochemical oxygen storage.",2022-08-30
439,Endophenotype effect sizes support variant pathogenicity in monogenic disease susceptibility genes,"Accurate and efficient classification of variant pathogenicity is critical for research and clinical care. Using data from three large studies, we demonstrate that population-based associations between rare variants and quantitative endophenotypes for three monogenic diseases (low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol for familial hypercholesterolemia, electrocardiographic QTc interval for long QT syndrome, and glycosylated hemoglobin for maturity-onset diabetes of the young) provide evidence for variant pathogenicity. Effect sizes are associated with pathogenic ClinVar assertions (P < 0.001 for each trait) and discriminate pathogenic from non-pathogenic variants (area under the curve 0.82-0.84 across endophenotypes). An effect size threshold of ≥ 0.5 times the endophenotype standard deviation nominates up to 35% of rare variants of uncertain significance or not in ClinVar in disease susceptibility genes with pathogenic potential. We propose that variant associations with quantitative endophenotypes for monogenic diseases can provide evidence supporting pathogenicity.","Accurate classification of genetic variants is critical for research and patient care. Here, the authors report that population-based associations between rare variants and quantitative endophenotypes for monogenic diseases can provide support for variant pathogenicity.",2022-08-30
440,Antiviral efficacy of favipiravir against Zika and SARS-CoV-2 viruses in non-human primates,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exemplified that rigorous evaluation in large animal models is key for translation from promising in vitro results to successful clinical implementation. Among the drugs that have been largely tested in clinical trials but failed so far to bring clear evidence of clinical efficacy is favipiravir, a nucleoside analogue with large spectrum activity against several RNA viruses in vitro and in small animal models. Here, we evaluate the antiviral activity of favipiravir against Zika or SARS-CoV-2 virus in cynomolgus macaques. In both models, high doses of favipiravir are initiated before infection and viral kinetics are evaluated during 7 to 15 days after infection. Favipiravir leads to a statistically significant reduction in plasma Zika viral load compared to untreated animals. However, favipiravir has no effects on SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics, and 4 treated animals have to be euthanized due to rapid clinical deterioration, suggesting a potential role of favipiravir in disease worsening in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. To summarize, favipiravir has an antiviral activity against Zika virus but not against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the cynomolgus macaque model. Our results support the clinical evaluation of favipiravir against Zika virus but they advocate against its use against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Repurposed antiviral drugs present as a valuable resource in the defence during outbreaks, with rigorous evaluation in large animal models keys for translation to clinical implementation. Here, the authors explore the antiviral activity of favipiravir against Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques, in order to support future clinical investigations into this RNA polymerase inhibitor.",2022-08-30
441,Structural basis for shape-selective recognition and aminoacylation of a D-armless human mitochondrial tRNA,"Human mitochondrial gene expression relies on the specific recognition and aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNAs (mtRNAs) by nuclear-encoded mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mt-aaRSs). Despite their essential role in cellular energy homeostasis, strong mutation pressure and genetic drift have led to an unparalleled sequence erosion of animal mtRNAs. The structural and functional consequences of this erosion are not understood. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the human mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase (mSerRS) in complex with mtRNASer(GCU). These structures reveal a unique mechanism of substrate recognition and aminoacylation. The mtRNASer(GCU) is highly degenerated, having lost the entire D-arm, tertiary core, and stable L-shaped fold that define canonical tRNAs. Instead, mtRNASer(GCU) evolved unique structural innovations, including a radically altered T-arm topology that serves as critical identity determinant in an unusual shape-selective readout mechanism by mSerRS. Our results provide a molecular framework to understand the principles of mito-nuclear co-evolution and specialized mechanisms of tRNA recognition in mammalian mitochondrial gene expression.",Mitochondrial tRNAs are indispensable and yet underwent an extreme mutational erosion. The authors report the structures of a mitochondrial aaRS-tRNA complex and show how the most degenerated of all human mtRNAs is recognized by its cognate synthetase to maintain mitochondrial gene expression.,2022-08-30
442,Organic phosphorescent nanoscintillator for low-dose X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy,"X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy utilizes penetrating X-rays to activate reactive oxygen species in deep tissues for cancer treatment, which combines the advantages of photodynamic therapy and radiotherapy. Conventional therapy usually requires heavy-metal-containing inorganic scintillators and organic photosensitizers to generate singlet oxygen. Here, we report a more convenient strategy for X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy based on a class of organic phosphorescence nanoscintillators, that act in a dual capacity as scintillators and photosensitizers. The resulting low dose of 0.4 Gy and negligible adverse effects demonstrate the great potential for the treatment of deep tumours. These findings provide an optional route that leverages the optical properties of purely organic scintillators for deep-tissue photodynamic therapy. Furthermore, these organic nanoscintillators offer an opportunity to expand applications in the fields of biomaterials and nanobiotechnology.","Conventional X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy usually requires heavy-metal-containing inorganic scintillators and organic photosensitizers to generate singlet oxygen.

443,Multi-omics analysis defines highly refractory RAS burdened immature subgroup of infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"KMT2A-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represents the most refractory type of childhood leukemia. To uncover the molecular heterogeneity of this disease, we perform RNA sequencing, methylation array analysis, whole exome and targeted deep sequencing on 84 infants with KMT2A-rearranged leukemia. Our multi-omics clustering followed by single-sample and single-cell inference of hematopoietic differentiation establishes five robust integrative clusters (ICs) with different master transcription factors, fusion partners and corresponding stages of B-lymphopoietic and early hemato-endothelial development: IRX-type differentiated (IC1), IRX-type undifferentiated (IC2), HOXA-type MLLT1 (IC3), HOXA-type MLLT3 (IC4), and HOXA-type AFF1 (IC5). Importantly, our deep mutational analysis reveals that the number of RAS pathway mutations predicts prognosis and that the most refractory subgroup of IC2 possesses 100% frequency and the heaviest burden of RAS pathway mutations. Our findings highlight the previously under-appreciated intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity of KMT2A-rearranged infant ALL and provide a rationale for the future development of genomics-guided risk stratification and individualized therapy.","The molecular heterogeneity of KMT2A-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains poorly characterised. Here, the authors perform multi-omics analysis for 84 ALL patients and suggest 5 distinct subgroups for risk stratification and personalised treatment.’",2022-08-30
444,Juno spacecraft gravity measurements provide evidence for normal modes of Jupiter,"The Juno spacecraft has been collecting data to shed light on the planet’s origin and characterize its interior structure. The onboard gravity science experiment based on X-band and Ka-band dual-frequency Doppler tracking precisely measured Jupiter’s zonal gravitational field. Here, we analyze 22 Juno’s gravity passes to investigate the gravity field. Our analysis provides evidence of new gravity field features, which perturb its otherwise axially symmetric structure with a time-variable component. We show that normal modes of the planet could explain the anomalous signatures present in the Doppler data better than other alternative explanations, such as localized density anomalies and non-axisymmetric components of the static gravity field. We explain Juno data by p-modes having an amplitude spectrum with a peak radial velocity of 10–50 cm/s at 900–1200 μHz (compatible with ground-based observations) and provide upper bounds on lower frequency f-modes (radial velocity smaller than 1 cm/s). The new Juno results could open the possibility of exploring the interior structure of the gas giants through measurements of the time-variable gravity or with onboard instrumentation devoted to the observation of normal modes, which could drive spacecraft operations of future missions.","Juno spacecraft experienced unknown accelerations near the closest approach to Jupiter. Here, the authors show that Jupiter’s axially symmetric, north-south asymmetric gravity field measured by Juno is perturbed by a time-variable component, associated to internal oscillations.",2022-08-30
445,Structure and dynamics of Toll immunoreceptor activation in the mosquito Aedes aegypti,"Aedes aegypti has evolved to become an efficient vector for arboviruses but the mechanisms of host-pathogen tolerance are unknown. Immunoreceptor Toll and its ligand Spaetzle have undergone duplication which may allow neofunctionalization and adaptation. Here we present cryo-EM structures and biophysical characterisation of low affinity Toll5A complexes that display transient but specific interactions with Spaetzle1C, forming asymmetric complexes, with only one ligand clearly resolved. Loop structures of Spaetzle1C and Toll5A intercalate, temporarily bridging the receptor C-termini to promote signalling. By contrast unbound receptors form head-to-head homodimers that keep the juxtamembrane regions far apart in an inactive conformation. Interestingly the transcriptional signature of Spaetzle1C differs from other Spaetzle cytokines and controls genes involved in innate immunity, metabolism and tissue regeneration. Taken together our results explain how upregulation of Spaetzle1C in the midgut and Toll5A in the salivary gland shape the concomitant immune response.",Aedes aegypti can act as a vector for viral pathogens but the mechanism of viral resistance and evolving host-pathogen tolerance are poorly understood. Here the authors structurally characterise a duplicated pair of interacting Toll immunoreceptors and the cytokine ligand Spaetzle1C and show their dose-dependent function and mechanism of activation.,2022-08-30
446,Transcontinental spread and evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis W148 European/Russian clade toward extensively drug resistant tuberculosis,"Transmission-driven multi-/extensively drug resistant (M/XDR) tuberculosis (TB) is the largest single contributor to human mortality due to antimicrobial resistance. A few major clades of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex belonging to lineage 2, responsible for high prevalence of MDR-TB in Eurasia, show outstanding transnational distributions. Here, we determined factors underlying the emergence and epidemic spread of the W148 clade by genome sequencing and Bayesian demogenetic analyses of 720 isolates from 23 countries. We dated a common ancestor around 1963 and identified two successive epidemic expansions in the late 1980s and late 1990s, coinciding with major socio-economic changes in the post-Soviet Era. These population expansions favored accumulation of resistance mutations to up to 11 anti-TB drugs, with MDR evolving toward additional resistances to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs within 20 years on average. Timescaled haplotypic density analysis revealed that widespread acquisition of compensatory mutations was associated with transmission success of XDR strains. Virtually all W148 strains harbored a hypervirulence-associated ppe38 gene locus, and incipient recurrent emergence of prpR mutation-mediated drug tolerance was detected. The outstanding genetic arsenal of this geographically widespread M/XDR strain clade represents a “perfect storm” that jeopardizes the successful introduction of new anti-M/XDR-TB antibiotic regimens.","An outbreak of the multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage W148 has spread widely across Russia, Central Asia and Europe. Here, the authors use whole genome sequences of ~700 isolates of this lineage collected over ~20 years to analyze its spread, evolution of drug resistance, and impact of compensatory mutations.",2022-08-30
447,Structural bases for aspartate recognition and polymerization efficiency of cyanobacterial cyanophycin synthetase,"Cyanophycin is a natural biopolymer consisting of equimolar amounts of aspartate and arginine as the backbone and branched sidechain, respectively. It is produced by a single enzyme, cyanophycin synthetase (CphA1), and accumulates as a nitrogen reservoir during N2 fixation by most cyanobacteria. A recent structural study showed that three constituent domains of CphA1 function as two distinct catalytic sites and an oligomerization interface in cyanophycin synthesis. However, it remains unclear how the ATP-dependent addition of aspartate to cyanophycin is initiated at the catalytic site of the glutathione synthetase-like domain. Here, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structures of CphA1, including a complex with aspartate, cyanophycin primer peptide, and ATP analog. These structures reveal the aspartate binding mode and phosphate-binding loop movement to the active site required for the reaction. Furthermore, structural and mutational data show a potential role of protein dynamics in the catalytic efficiency of the arginine condensation reaction.","CphA1 catalyzes the synthesis of cyanophycin polypeptide consisting of equimolar amounts of aspartate and arginine as a fixed nitrogen reservoir in cyanobacteria.

448,Biliary NIK promotes ductular reaction and liver injury and fibrosis in mice,"Excessive cholangiocyte expansion (ductular reaction) promotes liver disease progression, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we identify biliary NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) as a pivotal regulator of ductular reaction. NIK is known to activate the noncanonical IKKα/NF-κB2 pathway and regulate lymphoid tissue development. We find that cholangiocyte NIK is upregulated in mice with cholestasis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL), 5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), or α-naphtyl-isothiocyanate (ANIT). DDC, ANIT, or BDL induces ductular reaction, liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. Cholangiocyte-specific deletion of NIK, but not IKKα, blunts these pathological alterations. NIK inhibitor treatment similarly ameliorates DDC-induced ductular reaction, liver injury, and fibrosis. Biliary NIK directly increases cholangiocyte proliferation while suppressing cholangiocyte death, and it also promotes secretion of cholangiokines from cholangiocytes. Cholangiokines stimulate liver macrophages and hepatic stellate cells, augmenting liver inflammation and fibrosis. These results unveil a NIK/ductular reaction axis and a NIK/cholangiokine axis that promote liver disease progression.","Excessive expansion of cholangiocytes in the liver leads to ductular reaction and liver disease. Here, the authors show that genetic ablation, or pharmacological inhibition, of biliary NIK blocks ductular reaction, liver inflammation, and liver fibrosis in mice by modulating secretion of cholangiokines that mediate liver inflammation and fibrosis.",2022-08-30
449,Dynamic mechanisms of CRISPR interference by Escherichia coli CRISPR-Cas3,"Type I CRISPR-Cas3 uses an RNA-guided multi Cas-protein complex, Cascade, which detects and degrades foreign nucleic acids via the helicase-nuclease Cas3 protein. Despite many studies using cryoEM and smFRET, the precise mechanism of Cas3-mediated cleavage and degradation of target DNA remains elusive. Here we reconstitute the CRISPR-Cas3 system in vitro to show how the Escherichia coli Cas3 (EcoCas3) with EcoCascade exhibits collateral non-specific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage and target specific DNA degradation. Partial binding of EcoCascade to target DNA with tolerated mismatches within the spacer sequence, but not the PAM, elicits collateral ssDNA cleavage activity of recruited EcoCas3. Conversely, stable binding with complete R-loop formation drives EcoCas3 to nick the non-target strand (NTS) in the bound DNA. Helicase-dependent unwinding then combines with trans ssDNA cleavage of the target strand and repetitive cis cleavage of the NTS to degrade the target double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) substrate. High-speed atomic force microscopy demonstrates that EcoCas3 bound to EcoCascade repeatedly reels and releases the target DNA, followed by target fragmentation. Together, these results provide a revised model for collateral ssDNA cleavage and target dsDNA degradation by CRISPR-Cas3, furthering understanding of type I CRISPR priming and interference and informing future genome editing tools.","In this study, Yoshimi et al. report on the mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas3 non-specific cleavage of single-stranded DNA and target-specific degradation of double stranded DNA. They employ high-speed AFM to capture images of type I CRISPR priming and interference.",2022-08-30
450,Early macrophage response to obesity encompasses Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 regulated mitochondrial architecture remodelling,"Adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) adapt to changes in their energetic microenvironment. Caloric excess, in a range from transient to diet-induced obesity, could result in the transition of ATMs from highly oxidative and protective to highly inflammatory and metabolically deleterious. Here, we demonstrate that Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 (IRF5) is a key regulator of macrophage oxidative capacity in response to caloric excess. ATMs from mice with genetic-deficiency of Irf5 are characterised by increased oxidative respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential. Transient inhibition of IRF5 activity leads to a similar respiratory phenotype as genomic deletion, and is reversible by reconstitution of IRF5 expression. We find that the highly oxidative nature of Irf5-deficient macrophages results from transcriptional de-repression of the mitochondrial matrix component Growth Hormone Inducible Transmembrane Protein (GHITM) gene. The Irf5-deficiency-associated high oxygen consumption could be alleviated by experimental suppression of Ghitm expression. ATMs and monocytes from patients with obesity or with type-2 diabetes retain the reciprocal regulatory relationship between Irf5 and Ghitm. Thus, our study provides insights into the mechanism of how the inflammatory transcription factor IRF5 controls physiological adaptation to diet-induced obesity via regulating mitochondrial architecture in macrophages.","Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 levels have been shown to increase in adipose tissue macrophages in diet-induced obesity. Here authors show that IRF5 transcriptionally represses the Growth Hormone Inducible Transmembrane Protein gene encoding a mitochondrial protein important for oxidative respiration in macrophages, thus driving the detrimental metabolic changes observed in obesity.",2022-08-30
451,Controlling gene expression with deep generative design of regulatory DNA,"Design of de novo synthetic regulatory DNA is a promising avenue to control gene expression in biotechnology and medicine. Using mutagenesis typically requires screening sizable random DNA libraries, which limits the designs to span merely a short section of the promoter and restricts their control of gene expression. Here, we prototype a deep learning strategy based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) by learning directly from genomic and transcriptomic data. Our ExpressionGAN can traverse the entire regulatory sequence-expression landscape in a gene-specific manner, generating regulatory DNA with prespecified target mRNA levels spanning the whole gene regulatory structure including coding and adjacent non-coding regions. Despite high sequence divergence from natural DNA, in vivo measurements show that 57% of the highly-expressed synthetic sequences surpass the expression levels of highly-expressed natural controls. This demonstrates the applicability and relevance of deep generative design to expand our knowledge and control of gene expression regulation in any desired organism, condition or tissue.","Design of de novo synthetic regulatory DNA is a promising avenue to control gene expression in biotechnology and medicine. Here the authors present EspressionGAN, a generative adversarial network that uses genomic and transcriptomic data to generate regulatory sequences.",2022-08-30
452,A prospective observational study of post-COVID-19 chronic fatigue syndrome following the first pandemic wave in Germany and biomarkers associated with symptom severity,"A subset of patients has long-lasting symptoms after mild to moderate Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In a prospective observational cohort study, we analyze clinical and laboratory parameters in 42 post-COVID-19 syndrome patients (29 female/13 male, median age 36.5 years) with persistent moderate to severe fatigue and exertion intolerance six months following COVID-19. Further we evaluate an age- and sex-matched postinfectious non-COVID-19 myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome cohort comparatively. Most post-COVID-19 syndrome patients are moderately to severely impaired in daily live. 19 post-COVID-19 syndrome patients fulfill the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Disease severity and symptom burden is similar in post-COVID-19 syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and non-COVID-19/myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome patients. Hand grip strength is diminished in most patients compared to normal values in healthy. Association of hand grip strength with hemoglobin, interleukin 8 and C-reactive protein in post-COVID-19 syndrome/non-myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and with hemoglobin, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, bilirubin, and ferritin in post-COVID-19 syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome may indicate low level inflammation and hypoperfusion as potential pathomechanisms.",Some patients experience long-lasting symptoms after coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

453,Integrated relationship of nasopharyngeal airway host response and microbiome associates with bronchiolitis severity,"Bronchiolitis is a leading cause of infant hospitalizations but its immunopathology remains poorly understood. Here we present data from 244 infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis in a multicenter prospective study, assessing the host response (transcriptome), microbial composition, and microbial function (metatranscriptome) in the nasopharyngeal airway, and associate them with disease severity. We investigate individual associations with disease severity identify host response, microbial taxonomical, and microbial functional modules by network analyses. We also determine the integrated relationship of these modules with severity. Several modules are significantly associated with risks of positive pressure ventilation use, including the host-type I interferon, neutrophil/interleukin-1, T cell regulation, microbial-branched-chain amino acid metabolism, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen modules. Taken together, we show complex interplays between host and microbiome, and their contribution to disease severity.","Bronchiolitis is major cause of infection, morbidity and hospitalisation. Here the authors apply transcriptomic based assessment of the host response, microbiome composition and function, and associate this to bronchiolitis severity.",2022-08-30
454,Synthesizing theories of human language with Bayesian program induction,"Automated, data-driven construction and evaluation of scientific models and theories is a long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence. We present a framework for algorithmically synthesizing models of a basic part of human language: morpho-phonology, the system that builds word forms from sounds. We integrate Bayesian inference with program synthesis and representations inspired by linguistic theory and cognitive models of learning and discovery. Across 70 datasets from 58 diverse languages, our system synthesizes human-interpretable models for core aspects of each language’s morpho-phonology, sometimes approaching models posited by human linguists. Joint inference across all 70 data sets automatically synthesizes a meta-model encoding interpretable cross-language typological tendencies. Finally, the same algorithm captures few-shot learning dynamics, acquiring new morphophonological rules from just one or a few examples. These results suggest routes to more powerful machine-enabled discovery of interpretable models in linguistics and other scientific domains.","Humans can infer rules for building words in a new language from a handful of examples, and linguists also can infer language patterns across related languages. Here, the authors provide an algorithm which models these grammatical abilities by synthesizing human-understandable programs for building words.",2022-08-30
455,Adipocytes control food intake and weight regain via Vacuolar-type H+ ATPase,"Energy metabolism becomes dysregulated in individuals with obesity and many of these changes persist after weight loss and likely play a role in weight regain. In these studies, we use a mouse model of diet-induced obesity and weight loss to study the transcriptional memory of obesity. We found that the ‘metabolic memory’ of obesity is predominantly localized in adipocytes. Utilizing a C. elegans-based food intake assay, we identify ‘metabolic memory’ genes that play a role in food intake regulation. We show that expression of ATP6v0a1, a subunit of V-ATPase, is significantly induced in both obese mouse and human adipocytes that persists after weight loss. C. elegans mutants deficient in Atp6v0A1/unc32 eat less than WT controls. Adipocyte-specific Atp6v0a1 knockout mice have reduced food intake and gain less weight in response to HFD. Pharmacological disruption of V-ATPase assembly leads to decreased food intake and less weight re-gain. In summary, using a series of genetic tools from invertebrates to vertebrates, we identify ATP6v0a1 as a regulator of peripheral metabolic memory, providing a potential target for regulation of food intake, weight loss maintenance and the treatment of obesity.","Energy metabolism is dysregulated in obesity, and some if these changes persist after weight loss and may contribute to weight regain. Here the authors report that a vacuolar-type H+ ATPase, ATP6v0a1, is induced in adipocytes during obesity and persists after weight loss, and regulates food intake and weight gain in C. elegans and mice.",2022-08-30
456,Noninvasive imaging of the tumor immune microenvironment correlates with response to immunotherapy in gastric cancer,"The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is associated with tumor prognosis and immunotherapy response. Here we develop and validate a CT-based radiomics score (RS) using 2272 gastric cancer (GC) patients to investigate the relationship between the radiomics imaging biomarker and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the TIME, including its correlation with prognosis and immunotherapy response in advanced GC. The RS achieves an AUC of 0.795–0.861 in predicting the NLR in the TIME. Notably, the radiomics imaging biomarker is indistinguishable from the IHC-derived NLR status in predicting DFS and OS in each cohort (HR range: 1.694–3.394, P < 0.001). We find the objective responses of a cohort of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy patients is significantly higher in the low-RS group (60.9% and 42.9%) than in the high-RS group (8.1% and 14.3%). The radiomics imaging biomarker is a noninvasive method to evaluate TIME, and may correlate with prognosis and anti PD-1 immunotherapy response in GC patients.","Tumour microenvironment has been linked with immunotherapy response in gastric cancer.

457,Molecular identification and quantification of defect sites in metal-organic frameworks with NMR probe molecules,"The defects in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can dramatically alter their pore structure and chemical properties. However, it has been a great challenge to characterize the molecular structure of defects, especially when the defects are distributed irregularly in the lattice. In this work, we applied a characterization strategy based on solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to assess the chemistry of defects. This strategy takes advantage of the coordination-sensitive phosphorus probe molecules, e.g., trimethylphosphine (TMP) and trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO), that can distinguish the subtle differences in the acidity of defects. A variety of local chemical environments have been identified in defective and ideal MOF lattices. The geometric dimension of defects can also be evaluated by using the homologs of probe molecules with different sizes. In addition, our method provides a reliable way to quantify the density of defect sites, which comes together with the molecular details of local pore environments. The comprehensive solid-state NMR strategy can be of great value for a better understanding of MOF structures and for guiding the design of MOFs with desired catalytic or adsorption properties.",Defects in porous materials can alter the pore structure and chemical properties.

458,Deconvoluting complex correlates of COVID-19 severity with a multi-omic pandemic tracking strategy,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has differentially impacted populations across race and ethnicity. A multi-omic approach represents a powerful tool to examine risk across multi-ancestry genomes. We leverage a pandemic tracking strategy in which we sequence viral and host genomes and transcriptomes from nasopharyngeal swabs of 1049 individuals (736 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 313 SARS-CoV-2 negative) and integrate them with digital phenotypes from electronic health records from a diverse catchment area in Northern California. Genome-wide association disaggregated by admixture mapping reveals novel COVID-19-severity-associated regions containing previously reported markers of neurologic, pulmonary and viral disease susceptibility. Phylodynamic tracking of consensus viral genomes reveals no association with disease severity or inferred ancestry. Summary data from multiomic investigation reveals metagenomic and HLA associations with severe COVID-19. The wealth of data available from residual nasopharyngeal swabs in combination with clinical data abstracted automatically at scale highlights a powerful strategy for pandemic tracking, and reveals distinct epidemiologic, genetic, and biological associations for those at the highest risk.","There is a genetic component to the risk of severe COVID-19, but the genetic effects are difficult to separate from social constructs that covary with genetic ancestry. To address this, the authors identify determinants of COVID-19 severity using admixture mapping, viral phylodynamics, and host immune and metagenomic sequencing.",2022-08-30
459,A Pilot randomized trial to examine effects of a hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system on neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcomes in adolescents with type 1 diabetes,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with lower scores on tests of cognitive and neuropsychological function and alterations in brain structure and function in children. This proof-of-concept pilot study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03428932) examined whether MRI-derived indices of brain development and function and standardized IQ scores in adolescents with T1D could be improved with better diabetes control using a hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system. Eligibility criteria for participation in the study included age between 14 and 17 years and a diagnosis of T1D before 8 years of age. Randomization to either a hybrid closed-loop or standard diabetes care group was performed after pre-qualification, consent, enrollment, and collection of medical background information. Of 46 participants assessed for eligibility, 44 met criteria and were randomized. Two randomized participants failed to complete baseline assessments and were excluded from final analyses. Participant data were collected across five academic medical centers in the United States. Research staff scoring the cognitive assessments as well as those processing imaging data were blinded to group status though participants and their families were not. Forty-two adolescents, 21 per group, underwent cognitive assessment and multi-modal brain imaging before and after the six month study duration. HbA1c and sensor glucose downloads were obtained quarterly. Primary outcomes included metrics of gray matter (total and regional volumes, cortical surface area and thickness), white matter volume, and fractional anisotropy. Estimated power to detect the predicted treatment effect was 0.83 with two-tailed, α = 0.05. Adolescents in the hybrid closed-loop group showed significantly greater improvement in several primary outcomes indicative of neurotypical development during adolescence compared to the standard care group including cortical surface area, regional gray volumes, and fractional anisotropy. The two groups were not significantly different on total gray and white matter volumes or cortical thickness. The hybrid closed loop group also showed higher Perceptual Reasoning Index IQ scores and functional brain activity more indicative of neurotypical development relative to the standard care group (both secondary outcomes). No adverse effects associated with study participation were observed. These results suggest that alterations to the developing brain in T1D might be preventable or reversible with rigorous glucose control. Long term research in this area is needed.",Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at risk for reduced cognitive ability and atypical brain development. This study shows that brain and cognitive measures can be improved in adolescents with T1D using a semi-automated insulin delivery system.,2022-08-30
460,The supernova remnant SN 1006 as a Galactic particle accelerator,"The origin of cosmic rays is a pivotal open issue of high-energy astrophysics. Supernova remnants are strong candidates to be the Galactic factory of cosmic rays, their blast waves being powerful particle accelerators. However, supernova remnants can power the observed flux of cosmic rays only if they transfer a significant fraction of their kinetic energy to the accelerated particles, but conclusive evidence for such efficient acceleration is still lacking. In this scenario, the shock energy channeled to cosmic rays should induce a higher post-shock density than that predicted by standard shock conditions. Here we show this effect, and probe its dependence on the orientation of the ambient magnetic field, by analyzing deep X-ray observations of the Galactic remnant of SN 1006. By comparing our results with state-of-the-art models, we conclude that SN 1006 is an efficient source of cosmic rays and obtain an observational support for the quasi-parallel acceleration mechanism.","It is known that cosmic rays could be accelerated by shock waves in supernova (SN) remnants. Here, the authors show that SN 1006 remnant is an efficient source of cosmic rays, providing observational support for the quasi-parallel acceleration mechanism.",2022-08-30
461,A multi-functional role for the MCM8/9 helicase complex in maintaining fork integrity during replication stress,"The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 8/9 helicase is a AAA+ complex involved in DNA replication-associated repair. Despite high sequence homology to the MCM2-7 helicase, a precise cellular role for MCM8/9 has remained elusive. We have interrogated the DNA synthesis ability and replication fork stability in cells lacking MCM8 or 9 and find that there is a functional partitioning of MCM8/9 activity between promoting replication fork progression and protecting persistently stalled forks. The helicase function of MCM8/9 aids in normal replication fork progression, but upon persistent stalling, MCM8/9 directs additional downstream stabilizers, including BRCA1 and Rad51, to protect forks from excessive degradation. Loss of MCM8 or 9 slows the overall replication rate and allows for excessive nascent strand degradation, detectable by increased markers of genomic damage. This evidence defines multifunctional roles for MCM8/9 in promoting normal replication fork progression and genome integrity following stress.","The MCM8/9 helicase has been implicated in DNA recombination processes with mutations in these genes causative for infertility and cancer. Here, the authors show that MCM8/9 aids normal fork progression and also stabilizes persistently stalled forks, acting upstream of RAD51 and BRCA1.",2022-08-30
462,Land use change and carbon emissions of a transformation to timber cities,"Using engineered wood for construction has been discussed for climate change mitigation. It remains unclear where and in which way the additional demand for wooden construction material shall be fulfilled. Here we assess the global and regional impacts of increased demand for engineered wood on land use and associated CO2 emissions until 2100 using an open-source land system model. We show that if 90% of the new urban population would be housed in newly built urban mid-rise buildings with wooden constructions, 106 Gt of additional CO2 could be saved by 2100. Forest plantations would need to expand by up to 149 Mha by 2100 and harvests from unprotected natural forests would increase. Our results indicate that expansion of timber plantations for wooden buildings is possible without major repercussions on agricultural production. Strong governance and careful planning are required to ensure a sustainable transition to timber cities even if frontier forests and biodiversity hotspots are protected.",Wood used in construction stores carbon and reduces the emissions from steel and cement production.

463,Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions,"Integration-to-threshold models of two-choice perceptual decision making have guided our understanding of human and animal behavior and neural processing. Although such models seem to extend naturally to multiple-choice decision making, consensus on a normative framework has yet to emerge, and hence the implications of threshold characteristics for multiple choices have only been partially explored. Here we consider sequential Bayesian inference and a conceptualisation of decision making as a particle diffusing in n-dimensions. We show by simulation that, within a parameterised subset of time-independent boundaries, the optimal decision boundaries comprise a degenerate family of nonlinear structures that jointly depend on the state of multiple accumulators and speed-accuracy trade-offs. This degeneracy is contrary to current 2-choice results where there is a single optimal threshold. Such boundaries support both stationary and collapsing thresholds as optimal strategies for decision-making, both of which result from stationary representations of nonlinear boundaries. Our findings point towards a normative theory of multiple-choice decision making, provide a characterisation of optimal decision thresholds under this framework, and inform the debate between stationary and dynamic decision boundaries for optimal decision making.",How animals make multiple-choice decisions over three or more alternatives is not well understood. Here the authors use simulations to uncover that there is not one but many optimal parameter value configurations on the reward landscape of the multiple-choice threshold boundaries.,2022-08-29

Standard formats like SBML and SBOL are used throughout to enforce the compatibility of the tools. In a study carried out at four different sites, we illustrate the link between pathway design and engineering with the building of a library of E. coli lycopene-producing strains. We also benchmark our workflows on literature and expert validated pathways. Overall, we find an 83% success rate in retrieving the validated pathways among the top 10 pathways generated by the workflows.","Automated design and build processes can rapidly accelerate work in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.

465,Investigation of the evolution of Pd-Pt supported on ceria for dry and wet methane oxidation,"Efficiently treating methane emissions in transportation remains a challenge. Here, we investigate palladium and platinum mono- and bimetallic ceria-supported catalysts synthesized by mechanical milling and by traditional impregnation for methane total oxidation under dry and wet conditions, reproducing those present in the exhaust of natural gas vehicles. By applying a toolkit of in situ synchrotron techniques (X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption and ambient pressure photoelectron spectroscopies), together with transmission electron microscopy, we show that the synthesis method greatly influences the interaction and structure at the nanoscale. Our results reveal that the components of milled catalysts have a higher ability to transform metallic Pd into Pd oxide species strongly interacting with the support, and achieve a modulated PdO/Pd ratio than traditionally-synthesized catalysts. We demonstrate that the unique structures attained by milling are key for the catalytic activity and correlate with higher methane conversion and longer stability in the wet feed.","Methane is a strong contributor to global warming. Here the authors demonstrate that mechanically prepared Pd-Pt supported on ceria catalysts abate methane better than conventionally impregnated ones, even under wet conditions, owing to a highly dynamic structure.",2022-08-29
466,Deep learning image segmentation reveals patterns of UV reflectance evolution in passerine birds,"Ultraviolet colouration is thought to be an important form of signalling in many bird species, yet broad insights regarding the prevalence of ultraviolet plumage colouration and the factors promoting its evolution are currently lacking. In this paper, we develop a image segmentation pipeline based on deep learning that considerably outperforms classical (i.e. non deep learning) segmentation methods, and use this to extract accurate information on whole-body plumage colouration from photographs of >24,000 museum specimens covering >4500 species of passerine birds. Our results demonstrate that ultraviolet reflectance, particularly as a component of other colours, is widespread across the passerine radiation but is strongly phylogenetically conserved. We also find clear evidence in support of the role of light environment in promoting the evolution of ultraviolet plumage colouration, and a weak trend towards higher ultraviolet plumage reflectance among bird species with ultraviolet rather than violet-sensitive visual systems. Overall, our study provides important broad-scale insight into an enigmatic component of avian colouration, as well as demonstrating that deep learning has considerable promise for allowing new data to be brought to bear on long-standing questions in ecology and evolution.","Here, the authors develop software that uses photographs of birds to extract information on plumage UV reflectance.

467,Structure of a nucleosome-bound MuvB transcription factor complex reveals DNA remodelling,"Genes encoding the core cell cycle machinery are transcriptionally regulated by the MuvB family of protein complexes in a cell cycle-specific manner. Complexes of MuvB with the transcription factors B-MYB and FOXM1 activate mitotic genes during cell proliferation. The mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by these complexes are still poorly characterised. Here, we combine biochemical analysis and in vitro reconstitution, with structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy and cross-linking mass spectrometry, to functionally examine these complexes. We find that the MuvB:B-MYB complex binds and remodels nucleosomes, thereby exposing nucleosomal DNA. This remodelling activity is supported by B-MYB which directly binds the remodelled DNA. Given the remodelling activity on the nucleosome, we propose that the MuvB:B-MYB complex functions as a pioneer transcription factor complex. In this work, we rationalise prior biochemical and cellular studies and provide a molecular framework of interactions on a protein complex that is key for cell cycle regulation.","The MuvB family of protein complexes regulate cell cycle-dependent transcription, and MuvB in complex with the transcription factors B-MYB and FOXM1 activate mitotic genes during G2.

It has, however, not yet been possible to determine the timing of individual partial waves, and steering their contribution has been a substantial challenge. Here, we develop a polarization-skewed attosecond chronoscopy serving as a partial wave meter to reveal the role of each partial wave from the angle-resolved photoionization phase shifts in rare gas atoms. We steer the relative ratio between different partial waves and realize a magnetic-sublevel-resolved atomic phase shift measurement. Our experimental observations are well supported by time-dependent R-matrix numerical simulations and analytical soft-photon approximation analysis. The symmetry-resolved, partial-wave analysis identifies the transition rate and phase shift property in the attosecond photoelectron emission dynamics. Our findings provide critical insights into the ubiquitous attosecond optical timer and the underlying attosecond photoionization dynamics.",Understanding the photoelectron emission time after the interaction of photon with atoms and molecules is of fundamental interest.

469,HnRNPK maintains single strand RNA through controlling double-strand RNA in mammalian cells,"Although antisense transcription is a widespread event in the mammalian genome, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formation between sense and antisense transcripts is very rare and mechanisms that control dsRNA remain unknown. By characterizing the FGF-2 regulated transcriptome in normal and cancer cells, we identified sense and antisense transcripts IER3 and IER3-AS1 that play a critical role in FGF-2 controlled oncogenic pathways. We show that IER3 and IER3-AS1 regulate each other’s transcription through HnRNPK-mediated post-transcriptional regulation. HnRNPK controls the mRNA stability and colocalization of IER3 and IER3-AS1. HnRNPK interaction with IER3 and IER3-AS1 determines their oncogenic functions by maintaining them in a single-stranded form. hnRNPK depletion neutralizes their oncogenic functions through promoting dsRNA formation and cytoplasmic accumulation. Intriguingly, hnRNPK loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments reveal its role in maintaining global single- and double-stranded RNA. Thus, our data unveil the critical role of HnRNPK in maintaining single-stranded RNAs and their physiological functions by blocking RNA-RNA interactions.","Using fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) induced sense and antisense transcripts IER3 and IER3-AS1 as a model system, authors highlight the role of HnRNPK in regulating double strand RNA formation in the loci with overlapping transcripts.",2022-08-29

Here, we report a vdW intrinsic ferromagnetic crystal Fe3GaTe2 that exhibits record-high above-room-temperature Curie temperature (Tc, ~350-380 K) for known 2D vdW intrinsic ferromagnets, high saturation magnetic moment (40.11 emu/g), large PMA energy density (~4.79 × 105 J/m3), and large anomalous Hall angle (3%) at room temperature. Such large room-temperature PMA is better than conventional widely-used ferromagnetic films like CoFeB, and one order of magnitude larger than known 2D vdW intrinsic ferromagnets. Room-temperature thickness and angle-dependent anomalous Hall devices and direct magnetic domains imaging based on Fe3GaTe2 nanosheet have been realized. This work provides an avenue for room-temperature 2D ferromagnetism, electrical control of 2D ferromagnetism and promote the practical applications of 2D-vdW-integrated spintronic devices.","In isotropic two dimensional systems, long range ferromagnetic order is supressed by thermal fluctuations, and it is due to magnetic anisotropy that van der Waals magnetic materials can have ferromagnetic ordering at finite temperatures.

471,Movable type printing method to synthesize high-entropy single-atom catalysts,"The controllable anchoring of multiple isolated metal atoms into a single support exhibits scientific and technological opportunities, while the synthesis of catalysts with multiple single metal atoms remains a challenge and has been rarely reported. Herein, we present a general route for anchoring up to eleven metals as highly dispersed single-atom centers on porous nitride-doped carbon supports with the developed movable type printing method, and label them as high-entropy single-atom catalysts. Various high-entropy single-atom catalysts with tunable multicomponent are successfully synthesized with the same method by adjusting only the printing templates and carbonization parameters. To prove utility, quinary high-entropy single-atom catalysts (FeCoNiCuMn) is investigated as oxygen reduction reaction catalyst with much more positive activity and durability than commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work broadens the family of single-atom catalysts and opens a way to investigate highly efficient single-atom catalysts with multiple compositions.","It is challenging to integrate multi-single metal atoms into one support.

472,Highly hydrated paramagnetic amorphous calcium carbonate nanoclusters as an MRI contrast agent,"Amorphous calcium carbonate plays a key role as transient precursor in the early stages of biogenic calcium carbonate formation in nature. However, due to its instability in aqueous solution, there is still rare success to utilize amorphous calcium carbonate in biomedicine. Here, we report the mutual effect between paramagnetic gadolinium ions and amorphous calcium carbonate, resulting in ultrafine paramagnetic amorphous carbonate nanoclusters in the presence of both gadolinium occluded highly hydrated carbonate-like environment and poly(acrylic acid). Gadolinium is confirmed to enhance the water content in amorphous calcium carbonate, and the high water content of amorphous carbonate nanoclusters contributes to the much enhanced magnetic resonance imaging contrast efficiency compared with commercially available gadolinium-based contrast agents. Furthermore, the enhanced T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging performance and biocompatibility of amorphous carbonate nanoclusters are further evaluated in various animals including rat, rabbit and beagle dog, in combination with promising safety in vivo. Overall, exceptionally facile mass-productive amorphous carbonate nanoclusters exhibit superb imaging performance and impressive stability, which provides a promising strategy to design magnetic resonance contrast agent.","Sensitive, biocompatible and stable contrast agents for MRI are in demand.

However, it suffers from low sensitivity at high-frequency dynamic stimuli. Here, inspired by finger structure—rigid skeleton embedded in muscle, we report a piezoelectric tactile sensor using a rigid-soft hybrid force-transmission-layer in combination with a soft bottom substrate, which not only greatly enhances the force transmission, but also triggers a significantly magnified effect in d31 working mode of the piezoelectric sensory layer, instead of conventional d33 mode. Experiments show that this sensor exhibits a super-high sensitivity of 346.5 pC N−1 (@ 30 Hz), wide bandwidth of 5–600 Hz and a linear force detection range of 0.009–4.3 N, which is ~17 times the theoretical sensitivity of d33 mode. Furthermore, the sensor is able to detect multiple force directions with high reliability, and shows great potential in robotic dynamic tactile sensing.","Designing efficient tactile sensors under high-frequency dynamic stimuli remains a challenge. Here, the authors demonstrate piezoelectric tactile sensor with sensitivity of 346.5 pCN−1, wide bandwidth of 5–600 Hz and a linear force detection range of 0.009–4.3 N using a rigid-soft hybrid force-transmission-layer in combination with a soft bottom substrate.",2022-08-29
474,Subcortical-cortical dynamical states of the human brain and their breakdown in stroke,"The mechanisms controlling dynamical patterns in spontaneous brain activity are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that cortical dynamics in the ultra-slow frequency range (<0.01–0.1 Hz) requires intact cortical-subcortical communication. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at rest, we identify Dynamic Functional States (DFSs), transient but recurrent clusters of cortical and subcortical regions synchronizing at ultra-slow frequencies. We observe that shifts in cortical clusters are temporally coincident with shifts in subcortical clusters, with cortical regions flexibly synchronizing with either limbic regions (hippocampus/amygdala), or subcortical nuclei (thalamus/basal ganglia). Focal lesions induced by stroke, especially those damaging white matter connections between basal ganglia/thalamus and cortex, provoke anomalies in the fraction times, dwell times, and transitions between DFSs, causing a bias toward abnormal network integration. Dynamical anomalies observed 2 weeks after stroke recover in time and contribute to explaining neurological impairment and long-term outcome.","Favaretto et al. show that the brain rapidly alternates between transient connectivity patterns, with cortical regions flexibly synchronizing with two groups of subcortical regions, and that this dynamic is abnormal in stroke patients.",2022-08-29

Trypanosomes evade the adaptive immune response through antigenic variation, but little is known about how they interact with components of the innate immune response, including complement. Here we demonstrate that an invariant surface glycoprotein, ISG65, is a receptor for complement component 3 (C3). We show how ISG65 binds to the thioester domain of C3b. We also show that C3 contributes to control of trypanosomes during early infection in a mouse model and provide evidence that ISG65 is involved in reducing trypanosome susceptibility to C3-mediated clearance. Deposition of C3b on pathogen surfaces, such as trypanosomes, is a central point in activation of the complement system. In ISG65, trypanosomes have evolved a C3 receptor which diminishes the downstream effects of C3 deposition on the control of infection.","Trypanosomes evade the immune response through antigenic variation of a surface coat containing variant surface glycoproteins (VSG). They also express invariant surface glycoproteins (ISGs), which are less well understood. Here, Macleod et al. show that ISG65 of T. brucei is a receptor for complement component 3. They provide the crystal structure of T. brucei ISG65 in complex with complement C3d and show evidence that ISG65 is involved in reducing trypanosome susceptibility to C3-mediated clearance in vivo.",2022-08-29
476,Achieving efficient power generation by designing bioinspired and multi-layered interfacial evaporator,"Water evaporation is a natural phase change phenomenon occurring any time and everywhere. Enormous efforts have been made to harvest energy from this ubiquitous process by leveraging on the interaction between water and materials with tailored structural, chemical and thermal properties. Here, we develop a multi-layered interfacial evaporation-driven nanogenerator (IENG) that further amplifies the interaction by introducing additional bionic light-trapping structure for efficient light to heat and electric generation on the top and middle of the device. Notable, we also rationally design the bottom layer for sufficient water transport and storage. We demonstrate the IENG performs a spectacular continuous power output as high as 11.8 μW cm−2 under optimal conditions, more than 6.8 times higher than the currently reported average value. We hope this work can provide a new bionic strategy using multiple natural energy sources for effective power generation.","The energy harvesting from ubiquitous natural water evaporation offers a great green energy source. Here, the authors report a bioinspired and multi-layered interfacial evaporation-driven nanogeneration strategy for efficient light-to-heat and electricity generation with continuous power output.",2022-08-29
477,"Circularly polarized light-sensitive, hot electron transistor with chiral plasmonic nanoparticles","The quantitative detection of circularly polarized light (CPL) is necessary in next-generation optical communication carrying high-density information and in phase-controlled displays exhibiting volumetric imaging. In the current technology, multiple pixels of different wavelengths and polarizers are required, inevitably resulting in high loss and low detection efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient CPL-detecting transistor composed of chiral plasmonic nanoparticles with a high Khun’s dissymmetry (g-factor) of 0.2 and a high mobility conducting oxide of InGaZnO. The device successfully distinguished the circular polarization state and displayed an unprecedented photoresponsivity of over 1 A/W under visible CPL excitation. This observation is mainly attributed to the hot electron generation in chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and to the effective collection of hot electrons in the oxide semiconducting transistor. Such characteristics further contribute to opto-neuromorphic operation and the artificial nervous system based on the device successfully performs image classification work. We anticipate that our strategy will aid in the rational design and fabrication of a high-performance CPL detector and opto-neuromorphic operation with a chiral plasmonic structure depending on the wavelength and circular polarization state.","One challenge with using circularly polarized light is an increased device complexity typically required to provide sufficient sensitivity to the polarization. Here, by integrating chiral plasmonic nanoparticles with a InGaZnO hot electron transistor, the authors present a polarization sensitive, optically active transistor.",2022-08-29
478,Divergent changes in particulate and mineral-associated organic carbon upon permafrost thaw,"Permafrost thaw can stimulate microbial decomposition and induce soil carbon (C) loss, potentially triggering a positive C-climate feedback. However, earlier observations have concentrated on bulk soil C dynamics upon permafrost thaw, with limited evidence involving soil C fractions. Here, we explore how the functionally distinct fractions, including particulate and mineral-associated organic C (POC and MAOC) as well as iron-bound organic C (OC-Fe), respond to permafrost thaw using systematic measurements derived from one permafrost thaw sequence and five additional thermokarst-impacted sites on the Tibetan Plateau. We find that topsoil POC content substantially decreases, while MAOC content remains stable and OC-Fe accumulates due to the enriched Fe oxides after permafrost thaw. Moreover, the proportion of MAOC and OC-Fe increases along the thaw sequence and at most of the thermokarst-impacted sites. The relatively enriched stable soil C fractions would alleviate microbial decomposition and weaken its feedback to climate warming over long-term thermokarst development.","Based on observations from thermokarst-impacted sites on the Tibetan Plateau, the authors find substantial particulate organic carbon loss but stable mineral-associated organic carbon and enriched iron-bound organic carbon upon permafrost thaw.",2022-08-29
479,Heterostrain-enabled ultrahigh electrostrain in lead-free piezoelectric,"Piezoelectric materials provide high strain and large driving forces in actuators and can transform electrical energy into mechanical energy. Although they were discovered over 100 years ago, scientists are still searching for alternative lead-free piezoelectrics to reduce their environmental impact. Developing high-strain piezoelectric materials has been a long-term challenge, particularly challenging for the design of high-strain polycrystalline piezoelectrics containing no toxic lead element. In this work, we report one strategy to enhance the electrostrain via designing “heterostrain” through atomic-scale defect engineering and mesoscale domain engineering. We achieve an ultrahigh electrostrain of 2.3% at high temperature (220 °C) in lead-free polycrystalline ceramics, higher than all state-of-the-art piezoelectric materials, including lead-free and lead-based ceramics and single crystals. We demonstrate practical solutions for achieving high electrostrain in low-cost environmentally piezoelectric for various applications.","Developing high-strain piezoelectric materials has been a long-term challenge. Here, the authors report one strategy to enhance the electrostrain via designing heterostrain through atomic-scale defect engineering and mesoscale domain engineering.",2022-08-29
480,Emergent second law for non-equilibrium steady states,"The Gibbs distribution universally characterizes states of thermal equilibrium. In order to extend the Gibbs distribution to non-equilibrium steady states, one must relate the self-information \({{{{{{{\mathcal{I}}}}}}}}(x)=-\!\log ({P}_{{{{{{{{\rm{ss}}}}}}}}}(x))\) of microstate x to measurable physical quantities. This is a central problem in non-equilibrium statistical physics. By considering open systems described by stochastic dynamics which become deterministic in the macroscopic limit, we show that changes \({{\Delta }}{{{{{{{\mathcal{I}}}}}}}}={{{{{{{\mathcal{I}}}}}}}}({x}_{t})-{{{{{{{\mathcal{I}}}}}}}}({x}_{0})\) in steady state self-information along deterministic trajectories can be bounded by the macroscopic entropy production Σ. This bound takes the form of an emergent second law \({{\Sigma }}+{k}_{b}{{\Delta }}{{{{{{{\mathcal{I}}}}}}}}\,\ge \,0\), which contains the usual second law Σ ≥ 0 as a corollary, and is saturated in the linear regime close to equilibrium. We thus obtain a tighter version of the second law of thermodynamics that provides a link between the deterministic relaxation of a system and the non-equilibrium fluctuations at steady state. In addition to its fundamental value, our result leads to novel methods for computing non-equilibrium distributions, providing a deterministic alternative to Gillespie simulations or spectral methods.","Contrary to states of thermal equilibrium, there is no universal characterization of non-equilibrium steady states displaying constant flows of energy and/or matter. Here, the authors make progress in this direction by deriving an emergent and stricter version of the second law of thermodynamics.",2022-08-29
481,Imaging Cu2O nanocube hollowing in solution by quantitative in situ X-ray ptychography,"Understanding morphological changes of nanoparticles in solution is essential to tailor the functionality of devices used in energy generation and storage. However, we lack experimental methods that can visualize these processes in solution, or in electrolyte, and provide three-dimensional information. Here, we show how X-ray ptychography enables in situ nano-imaging of the formation and hollowing of nanoparticles in solution at 155 °C. We simultaneously image the growth of about 100 nanocubes with a spatial resolution of 66 nm. The quantitative phase images give access to the third dimension, allowing to additionally study particle thickness. We reveal that the substrate hinders their out-of-plane growth, thus the nanocubes are in fact nanocuboids. Moreover, we observe that the reduction of Cu2O to Cu triggers the hollowing of the nanocuboids. We critically assess the interaction of X-rays with the liquid sample. Our method enables detailed in-solution imaging for a wide range of reaction conditions.","Observing morphological changes of nanoparticles in solution requires advanced in-situ imaging methods. Here, the authors use X-ray ptychography to image the growth and hollowing of Cu2O nanocubes in 3D.",2022-08-29
482,PIF7 is a master regulator of thermomorphogenesis in shade,"The size of plant organs is highly responsive to environmental conditions. The plant’s embryonic stem, or hypocotyl, displays phenotypic plasticity, in response to light and temperature. The hypocotyl of shade avoiding species elongates to outcompete neighboring plants and secure access to sunlight. Similar elongation occurs in high temperature. However, it is poorly understood how environmental light and temperature cues interact to effect plant growth. We found that shade combined with warm temperature produces a synergistic hypocotyl growth response that dependent on PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 7 (PIF7) and auxin. This unique but agriculturally relevant scenario was almost totally independent on PIF4 activity. We show that warm temperature is sufficient to promote PIF7 DNA binding but not transcriptional activation and we demonstrate that additional, unknown factor/s must be working downstream of the phyB-PIF-auxin module. Our findings will improve the predictions of how plants will respond to increased ambient temperatures when grown at high density.","Plant hypocotyl elongation response to light and temperature. Here the authors show that shade combined with warm temperature synergistically enhances the hypocotyl growth response via the PIF7 transcription factor, auxin, and as yet unknown factor.",2022-08-29
483,A brainstem monosynaptic excitatory pathway that drives locomotor activities and sympathetic cardiovascular responses,"Exercise including locomotion requires appropriate autonomic cardiovascular adjustments to meet the metabolic demands of contracting muscles, yet the functional brain architecture underlying these adjustments remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate brainstem circuitry that plays an essential role in relaying volitional motor signals, i.e., central command, to drive locomotor activities and sympathetic cardiovascular responses. Mesencephalic locomotor neurons in rats transmit central command-driven excitatory signals onto the rostral ventrolateral medulla at least partially via glutamatergic processes, to activate both somatomotor and sympathetic nervous systems. Optogenetic excitation of this monosynaptic pathway elicits locomotor and cardiovascular responses as seen during running exercise, whereas pathway inhibition suppresses the locomotor activities and blood pressure elevation during voluntary running without affecting basal cardiovascular homeostasis. These results demonstrate an important subcortical pathway that transmits central command signals, providing a key insight into the central circuit mechanism required for the physiological conditioning essential to maximize exercise performance.","Functional brain architecture underlying autonomic adjustments to exercise has remained unknown. Here, the authors reveal a subcortical pathway that relays volitional motor signals to drive locomotor activities and sympathetic cardiovascular responses.",2022-08-29
484,Proteolytic processing induces a conformational switch required for antibacterial toxin delivery,"Many Gram-negative bacteria use CdiA effector proteins to inhibit the growth of neighboring competitors. CdiA transfers its toxic CdiA-CT region into the periplasm of target cells, where it is released through proteolytic cleavage. The N-terminal cytoplasm-entry domain of the CdiA-CT then mediates translocation across the inner membrane to deliver the C-terminal toxin domain into the cytosol. Here, we show that proteolysis not only liberates the CdiA-CT for delivery, but is also required to activate the entry domain for membrane translocation. Translocation function depends on precise cleavage after a conserved VENN peptide sequence, and the processed ∆VENN entry domain exhibits distinct biophysical and thermodynamic properties. By contrast, imprecisely processed CdiA-CT fragments do not undergo this transition and fail to translocate to the cytoplasm. These findings suggest that CdiA-CT processing induces a critical structural switch that converts the entry domain into a membrane-translocation competent conformation.","Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is an important mechanism of bacterial competition. Here, Bartelli et al. show that proteolytic processing of a CDI toxin induces a conformational switch required for translocation into target bacteria.",2022-08-29
485,Revealing the spatiotemporal complexity of the magnitude distribution and b-value during an earthquake sequence,"The Magnitude–Frequency-Distribution (MFD) of earthquakes is typically modeled with the (tapered) Gutenberg–Richter relation. The main parameter of this relation, the b-value, controls the relative rate of small and large earthquakes. Resolving spatiotemporal variations of the b-value is critical to understanding the earthquake occurrence process and improving earthquake forecasting. However, this variation is not well understood. Here we present remarkable MFD variability during the complex 2016/17 central Italy sequence using a high-resolution earthquake catalog. Isolating seismically active volumes (‘clusters’) reveals that the MFD differed in nearby clusters, varied or remained constant in time depending on the cluster, and increased in b-value in the cluster where the largest earthquake eventually occurred. These findings suggest that the fault system’s heterogeneity and complexity influence the MFD. Our findings raise the question “b-value of what?”: interpreting and using MFD variability needs a spatiotemporal scale that is physically meaningful, like the one proposed here.","The authors introduce a new perspective to study the spatiotemporal behavior of the magnitude–frequency distribution: spatially isolating seismogenic zones to provide an appropriate scale to resolve the b-value. Among those zones, the b-value behaved remarkably throughout the 2016 central Italy sequence.",2022-08-29
486,Cytoplasmic forces functionally reorganize nuclear condensates in oocytes,"Cells remodel their cytoplasm with force-generating cytoskeletal motors. Their activity generates random forces that stir the cytoplasm, agitating and displacing membrane-bound organelles like the nucleus in somatic and germ cells. These forces are transmitted inside the nucleus, yet their consequences on liquid-like biomolecular condensates residing in the nucleus remain unexplored. Here, we probe experimentally and computationally diverse nuclear condensates, that include nuclear speckles, Cajal bodies, and nucleoli, during cytoplasmic remodeling of female germ cells named oocytes. We discover that growing mammalian oocytes deploy cytoplasmic forces to timely impose multiscale reorganization of nuclear condensates for the success of meiotic divisions. These cytoplasmic forces accelerate nuclear condensate collision-coalescence and molecular kinetics within condensates. Disrupting the forces decelerates nuclear condensate reorganization on both scales, which correlates with compromised condensate-associated mRNA processing and hindered oocyte divisions that drive female fertility. We establish that cytoplasmic forces can reorganize nuclear condensates in an evolutionary conserved fashion in insects. Our work implies that cells evolved a mechanism, based on cytoplasmic force tuning, to functionally regulate a broad range of nuclear condensates across scales. This finding opens new perspectives when studying condensate-associated pathologies like cancer, neurodegeneration and viral infections.","Cytoskeletal activity generates mechanical forces known to agitate and displace membrane-bound organelles in the cytoplasm. In oocytes, Al Jord et al. discover that these cytoplasmic forces functionally remodel nuclear RNA-processing condensates across scales for developmental success.",2022-08-29
487,Self-shrinking soft demoulding for complex high-aspect-ratio microchannels,"Microchannels are the essential elements in animals, plants, and various artificial devices such as soft robotics, wearable sensors, and organs-on-a-chip. However, three-dimensional (3D) microchannels with complex geometry and a high aspect ratio remain challenging to generate by conventional methods such as soft lithography, template dissolution, and matrix swollen processes, although they are widespread in nature. Here, we propose a simple and solvent-free fabrication method capable of producing monolithic microchannels with complex 3D structures, long length, and small diameter. A soft template and a peeling-dominant template removal process are introduced to the demoulding process, which is referred to as soft demoulding here. In combination with thermal drawing technology, microchannels with a small diameter (10 µm), a high aspect ratio (6000, length-to-diameter), and intricate 3D geometries are generated. We demonstrate the vast applicability and significant impact of this technology in multiple scenarios, including soft robotics, wearable sensors, soft antennas, and artificial vessels.","Microchannels are the essential elements for the design of artificial devices but the fabrication of three dimensional (3D) microchannels with complex geometry and a high aspect ratio remains challenging.

488,High-entropy intermetallics on ceria as efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2,"The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 (CO2-ODP) is a promising technique for high-yield propylene production and CO2 utilization. The development of a highly efficient catalyst for CO2-ODP is of great interest and benefit to the chemical industry as well as net zero emissions. Here, we report a unique catalyst material and design concept based on high-entropy intermetallics for this challenging chemistry. A senary (PtCoNi)(SnInGa) catalyst supported on CeO2 with a PtSn intermetallic structure exhibits a considerably higher catalytic activity, C3H6 selectivity, long-term stability, and CO2 utilization efficiency at 600 °C than previously reported. Multi-metallization of the Pt and Sn sites by Co/Ni and In/Ga, respectively, greatly enhances propylene selectivity, CO2 activation ability, thermal stability, and regenerable ability. The results obtained in this study can promote carbon-neutralization of industrial processes for light alkane conversion.",The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 is a promising technique for high-yield propylene production and CO2 utilization.

489,Natural and anthropogenic contributions to the hurricane drought of the 1970s–1980s,"Atlantic hurricane activity experienced a pronounced lull during the 1970s and 1980s. The current explanation that anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing cooled the sea surface locally fails to capture the magnitude of this large decrease in activity. To explain this hurricane drought, we propose that the radiative effects of sulfate aerosols from Europe and North-America decreased precipitation in the Sahara-Sahel region, leading to an enhancement of dust regional emissions and transport over the Atlantic. This dust in turn enhanced the local decrease of sea-surface temperature and of hurricane activity. Here, we show that dust emissions from the Sahara peaked in phase with regional sulfate aerosol optical thickness and Sahel drought conditions, and that dust optical depth variations alone can explain nearly half of the sea-surface temperature depression in the 1970s and 1980s.","Atlantic hurricane numbers noticeably decreased in the 1970s and 1980s partly due to the cooling effect of eolian dust lofted from the Sahara, in response to local climate effects of aerosol pollutants emitted from Europe and North America.",2022-08-29
490,Construction of azaheterocycles via Pd-catalyzed migratory cycloannulation reaction of unactivated alkenes,"Azahetereocycles constitute important structural components in many biologically active natural compounds and marketed drugs, and represent the most promising scaffolds in drug discovery. Accordingly, the development of efficient and general synthetic methods for the construction of diverse azaheterocycles is the major goal in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report the efficient construction of a wide range of azaheterocycles via a Pd-catalyzed migratory cycloannulation strategy with unactivated alkenes. This strategy enables the rapid synthesis of a series of 6-, 7- and 8-membered azaheterocycles in high efficiency, and features a broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance under redox-neutral conditions. The significance of this finding is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of drug-like molecules with high step-economy. Preliminary mechanistic investigations reveal that this reaction underwent a sequentially migratory insertion to alkenes, metal migration process, and the aza-Michael addition to a quinone methide intermediate.","Azahetereocycles represent promising scaffolds in drug discovery.

491,Organization of the gravity-sensing system in zebrafish,"Motor circuits develop in sequence from those governing fast movements to those governing slow. Here we examine whether upstream sensory circuits are organized by similar principles. Using serial-section electron microscopy in larval zebrafish, we generated a complete map of the gravity-sensing (utricular) system spanning from the inner ear to the brainstem. We find that both sensory tuning and developmental sequence are organizing principles of vestibular topography. Patterned rostrocaudal innervation from hair cells to afferents creates an anatomically inferred directional tuning map in the utricular ganglion, forming segregated pathways for rostral and caudal tilt. Furthermore, the mediolateral axis of the ganglion is linked to both developmental sequence and neuronal temporal dynamics. Early-born pathways carrying phasic information preferentially excite fast escape circuits, whereas later-born pathways carrying tonic signals excite slower postural and oculomotor circuits. These results demonstrate that vestibular circuits are organized by tuning direction and dynamics, aligning them with downstream motor circuits and behaviors.","How sensory systems are organized during development remains unclear. Here, the authors used electron microscopy to examine the gravity-sensing system in zebrafish, finding that directional tuning and developmental age are organizing principles of the transformation from vestibular sensation to motor control.",2022-08-27
492,Integrated biosensor platform based on graphene transistor arrays for real-time high-accuracy ion sensing,"Two-dimensional materials such as graphene have shown great promise as biosensors, but suffer from large device-to-device variation due to non-uniform material synthesis and device fabrication technologies. Here, we develop a robust bioelectronic sensing platform  composed of  more than 200 integrated sensing units, custom-built high-speed readout electronics, and machine learning inference that overcomes these challenges to achieve rapid, portable, and reliable measurements. The platform demonstrates reconfigurable multi-ion electrolyte sensing capability and provides highly sensitive, reversible, and real-time response for potassium, sodium, and calcium ions in complex solutions despite variations in device performance. A calibration method leveraging the sensor redundancy and device-to-device variation is also proposed, while a machine learning model trained with multi-dimensional information collected through the multiplexed sensor array is used to enhance the sensing system’s functionality and accuracy in ion classification.","The potential of 2D materials for biosensing applications is often limited by large device-to-device variation.

493,Visualizing the failure of solid electrolyte under GPa-level interface stress induced by lithium eruption,"Solid electrolytes hold the promise for enabling high-performance lithium (Li) metal batteries, but suffer from Li-filament penetration issues. The mechanism of this rate-dependent failure, especially the impact of the electrochemo-mechanical attack from Li deposition, remains elusive. Herein, we reveal the Li deposition dynamics and associated failure mechanism of solid electrolyte by visualizing the Li|Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) interface evolution via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Under a strong mechanical constraint and low charging rate, the Li-deposition-induced stress enables the single-crystal Li to laterally expand on LLZO. However, upon Li “eruption”, the rapidly built-up local stress, reaching at least GPa level, can even crack single-crystal LLZO particles without apparent defects. In comparison, Li vertical growth by weakening the mechanical constraint can boost the local current density up to A·cm−2 level without damaging LLZO. Our results demonstrate that the crack initiation at the Li|LLZO interface depends strongly on not only the local current density but also the way and efficiency of mass/stress release. Finally, potential strategies enabling fast Li transport and stress relaxation at the interface are proposed for promoting the rate capability of solid electrolytes.","The mechanism of lithium dendrites penetrating solid electrolytes remains elusive. Herein, the authors reveal the Li deposition dynamics and the associated failure mechanism of solid electrolyte by visualizing the Li|LLZO interface evolution via in situ transmission electron microscopy.",2022-08-27
494,The KU-PARP14 axis differentially regulates DNA resection at stalled replication forks by MRE11 and EXO1,"Suppression of nascent DNA degradation has emerged as an essential role of the BRCA pathway in genome protection. In BRCA-deficient cells, the MRE11 nuclease is responsible for both resection of reversed replication forks, and accumulation of single stranded DNA gaps behind forks. Here, we show that the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP14 is a critical co-factor of MRE11. PARP14 is recruited to nascent DNA upon replication stress in BRCA-deficient cells, and through its catalytic activity, mediates the engagement of MRE11. Loss or inhibition of PARP14 suppresses MRE11-mediated fork degradation and gap accumulation, and promotes genome stability and chemoresistance of BRCA-deficient cells. Moreover, we show that the KU complex binds reversed forks and protects them against EXO1-catalyzed degradation. KU recruits the PARP14-MRE11 complex, which initiates partial resection to release KU and allow long-range resection by EXO1. Our work identifies a multistep process of nascent DNA processing at stalled replication forks in BRCA-deficient cells.","Protection of replication forks against nucleolytic degradation is crucial for genome stability. Here, Dhoonmoon et al identify PARP14 and the KU complex as essential regulators of fork degradation by MRE11 and EXO1 nucleases in BRCA-deficient cells.",2022-08-27
495,NODULIN HOMEOBOX is required for heterochromatin homeostasis in Arabidopsis,"Arabidopsis NODULIN HOMEOBOX (NDX) is a nuclear protein described as a regulator of specific euchromatic genes within transcriptionally active chromosome arms. Here we show that NDX is primarily a heterochromatin regulator that functions in pericentromeric regions to control siRNA production and non-CG methylation. Most NDX binding sites coincide with pericentromeric het-siRNA loci that mediate transposon silencing, and are antagonistic with R-loop structures that are prevalent in euchromatic chromosomal arms. Inactivation of NDX leads to differential siRNA accumulation and DNA methylation, of which CHH/CHG hypomethylation colocalizes with NDX binding sites. Hi-C analysis shows significant chromatin structural changes in the ndx mutant, with decreased intrachromosomal interactions at pericentromeres where NDX is enriched in wild-type plants, and increased interchromosomal contacts between KNOT-forming regions, similar to those observed in DNA methylation mutants. We conclude that NDX is a key regulator of heterochromatin that is functionally coupled to het-siRNA loci and non-CG DNA methylation pathways.",Arabidopsis NDX was previously reported as a regulator of euchromatic gene expression. Here the authors show that NDX functions at pericentromeric regions and regulates heterochromatin homeostasis by controlling siRNA production and non-CG methylation.,2022-08-27
496,Retromer deficiency in Tauopathy models enhances the truncation and toxicity of Tau,"Alteration of the levels, localization or post-translational processing of the microtubule associated protein Tau is associated with many neurodegenerative disorders. Here we develop adult-onset models for human Tau (hTau) toxicity in Drosophila that enable age-dependent quantitative measurement of central nervous system synapse loss and axonal degeneration, in addition to effects upon lifespan, to facilitate evaluation of factors that may contribute to Tau-dependent neurodegeneration. Using these models, we interrogate the interaction of hTau with the retromer complex, an evolutionarily conserved cargo-sorting protein assembly, whose reduced activity has been associated with both Parkinson’s and late onset Alzheimer’s disease. We reveal that reduction of retromer activity induces a potent enhancement of hTau toxicity upon synapse loss, axon retraction and lifespan through a specific increase in the production of a C-terminal truncated isoform of hTau. Our data establish a molecular and subcellular mechanism necessary and sufficient for the depletion of retromer activity to exacerbate Tau-dependent neurodegeneration.","Tau and the Retromer complex are both linked to Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. Using Drosophila neurodegeneration models, this study finds that low retromer activity induces a specific increase of a highly toxic truncated form of human Tau.",2022-08-27

Thanks to the tunability of the synchrotron source, we excited each H-terminated polyyne (HCnH with n = 8,10,12) to the maxima of its vibronic absorption spectrum allowing us to precisely determine the electronic and vibrational structure of the ground and excited states for the main observed vibrational mode. Selected transitions are shown to enhance specific overtone orders in the Raman spectrum in a specific way that can be explained by a simple analytical model based on Albrecht’s theory of resonance Raman scattering. The determined Huang–Rhys factors indicate a strong and size-dependent electron-phonon coupling increasing with the sp-carbon chain length.","H-capped polyynes are the simplest system to observe finite-length effects in carbyne. Here, the authors exploit synchrotron-based UV resonance Raman spectroscopy to explain a peculiar intensity behavior of multiple phonons scattering and show a size-dependent electron-phonon coupling.",2022-08-27
498,Glassy thermal conductivity in Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 single crystal,"As the periodic atomic arrangement of a crystal is made to a disorder or glassy-amorphous system by destroying the long-range order, lattice thermal conductivity, κL, decreases, and its fundamental characteristics changes. The realization of ultralow and unusual glass-like κL in a crystalline material is challenging but crucial to many applications like thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Herein, we demonstrate an ultralow (~0.20 W/m·K at room temperature) and glass-like temperature dependence (2–400 K) of κL in a single crystal of layered halide perovskite, Cs3Bi2I6Cl3. Acoustic phonons with low cut-off frequency (20 cm−1) are responsible for the low sound velocity in Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 and make the structure elastically soft. While a strong anharmonicity originates from the low energy and localized rattling-like vibration of Cs atoms, synchrotron X-ray pair-distribution function evidence a local structural distortion in the Bi-halide octahedra and Cl vacancy. The hierarchical chemical bonding and soft vibrations from selective sublattice leading to low κL is intriguing from lattice dynamical perspective as well as have potential applications.","The investigation of thermal conductivity is crucial to the success of many modern technologies. Here the authors have reported an unusual glass-like thermal conductivity in a single crystal of layered halide perovskite, Cs3Bi2I6Cl3.",2022-08-27
499,Limited impact of fingolimod treatment during the initial weeks of ART in SIV-infected rhesus macaques,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not curative due to the persistence of a reservoir of HIV-infected cells, particularly in tissues such as lymph nodes, with the potential to cause viral rebound after treatment cessation. In this study, fingolimod (FTY720), a lysophospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator is administered to SIV-infected rhesus macaques at initiation of ART to block the egress from lymphoid tissues of natural killer and T-cells, thereby promoting proximity between cytolytic cells and infected CD4+ T-cells. When compared with the ART-only controls, FTY720 treatment during the initial weeks of ART induces a profound lymphopenia and increases frequencies of CD8+ T-cells expressing perforin in lymph nodes, but not their killing capacity; FTY720 also increases frequencies of cytolytic NK cells in lymph nodes. This increase of cytolytic cells, however, does not limit measures of viral persistence during ART, including intact proviral genomes. After ART interruption, a subset of animals that initially receives FTY720 displays a modest delay in viral rebound, with reduced plasma viremia and frequencies of infected T follicular helper cells. Further research is needed to optimize the potential utility of FTY720 when coupled with strategies that boost the antiviral function of T-cells in lymphoid tissues.","Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is able to successfully suppress plasma viremia in most people living with HIV, ART withdrawal typically results in viral replication and rebound. Authors investigate the effect, in terms of delay in viral replication, and immune cell dynamics in lymphoid tissue, of fingolimod (FTY720) administration at the time of ART initiation in SIV-infected rhesus macaques.",2022-08-27
500,In-situ growth of robust superlubricated nano-skin on electrospun nanofibers for post-operative adhesion prevention,"It is a great challenge to achieve robustly bonded, fully covered, and nanoscaled coating on the surface of electrospun nanofibers. Herein, we develop a controllable, facile, and versatile strategy to in-situ grow superlubricated nano-skin (SLNS) on the single electrospun nanofiber. Specifically, zwitterionic polymer chains are generated from the nanofiber subsurface in an inside-out way, which consequently form a robust network interpenetrating with the polymeric chains of the nanofiber matrix. The nanofibers with SLNS are superlubricated with the coefficient of friction (COF) lower than 0.025, which is about 16-fold of reduction than the original nanofibers. The time-COF plot is very stable after 12, 000 cycles of friction test, and no abrasion is observed. Additionally, the developed nanofibrous membranes possess favorable tensile property and biocompatibility. Furthermore, the nanofibrous membranes with SLNS achieve prevention of post-operative adhesion, which is confirmed in both rat tendon adhesion model and abdominal adhesion model. Compared with clinically-used antiadhesive membranes such as Interceed and DK-film, our nanofibrous membranes are not only more effective but also have the advantage of lower production cost. Therefore, this study demonstrates a potential of the superlubricated nanofibrous membranes in-situ grown based on a SLNS strategy for achieving prevention of post-operative adhesion in clinics.","Post-operative adhesions are a major complication from surgical intervention. Here, the authors develop a technique to grow a super-lubricating layer over electrospun nanofibers which was demonstrated to prevent postoperative adhesions with better outcomes than commercial products when compared in two in vivo models.",2022-08-27
501,Organic matter composition and greenhouse gas production of thawing subsea permafrost in the Laptev Sea,"Subsea permafrost represents a large carbon pool that might be or become a significant greenhouse gas source. Scarcity of observational data causes large uncertainties. We here use five 21-56 m long subsea permafrost cores from the Laptev Sea to constrain organic carbon (OC) storage and sources, degradation state and potential greenhouse gas production upon thaw. Grain sizes, optically-stimulated luminescence and biomarkers suggest deposition of aeolian silt and fluvial sand over 160 000 years, with dominant fluvial/alluvial deposition of forest- and tundra-derived organic matter. We estimate an annual thaw rate of 1.3 ± 0.6 kg OC m−2 in subsea permafrost in the area, nine-fold exceeding organic carbon thaw rates for terrestrial permafrost. During 20-month incubations, CH4 and CO2 production averaged 1.7 nmol and 2.4 µmol g−1 OC d−1, providing a baseline to assess the contribution of subsea permafrost to the high CH4 fluxes and strong ocean acidification observed in the region.","Subsea permafrost underneath the Arctic Ocean is one of the least understood compartments of the global carbon cycle. Here, Wild et al. shed light on its carbon sources, degradation history and potential greenhouse gas release after thaw.",2022-08-27
502,Early postnatal serotonin modulation prevents adult-stage deficits in Arid1b-deficient mice through synaptic transcriptional reprogramming,"Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by early postnatal symptoms, although little is known about the mechanistic deviations that produce them and whether correcting them has long-lasting preventive effects on adult-stage deficits. ARID1B, a chromatin remodeler implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, exhibits strong embryonic- and early postnatal-stage expression. We report here that Arid1b-happloinsufficient (Arid1b+/–) mice display autistic-like behaviors at juvenile and adult stages accompanied by persistent decreases in excitatory synaptic density and transmission. Chronic treatment of Arid1b+/– mice with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, during the first three postnatal weeks prevents synaptic and behavioral deficits in adults. Mechanistically, these rescues accompany transcriptomic changes, including upregulation of FMRP targets and normalization of HDAC4/MEF2A-related transcriptional regulation of the synaptic proteins, SynGAP1 and Arc. These results suggest that chronic modulation of serotonergic receptors during critical early postnatal periods prevents synaptic and behavioral deficits in adult Arid1b+/– mice through transcriptional reprogramming.",ARID1B is a chromatin remodeler associated with autism spectrum disorders. Here the authors demonstrate that early postnatal serotonin modulation prevents adult stage deficits in Arid1b-deficient mice through synaptic transcriptional reprogramming.,2022-08-27
503,Replicative manufacturing of metal moulds for low surface roughness polymer replication,"Tool based manufacturing processes like injection moulding allow fast and high-quality mass-market production, but for optical polymer components the production of the necessary tools is time-consuming and expensive. In this paper a process to fabricate metal-inserts for tool based manufacturing with smooth surfaces via a casting and replication process from fused silica templates is presented. Bronze, brass and cobalt-chromium could be successfully replicated from shaped fused silica replications achieving a surface roughnesses of Rq 8 nm and microstructures in the range of 5 µm. Injection moulding was successfully performed, using a commercially available injection moulding system, with thousands of replicas generated from the same tool. In addition, three-dimensional bodies in metal could be realised with 3D-Printing of fused silica casting moulds. This work thus represents an approach to high-quality moulding tools via a scalable facile and cost-effective route surpassing the currently employed cost-, labour- and equipment-intensive machining techniques.","Production of tools for polymer replication in the field of optical applications is still time-consuming and cost-intensive. Here the authors develop an efficient metal casting process, and demonstrate manufacturing of structures of complex shapes with a surface roughness of few nanometres.",2022-08-27
504,Co-benefits of CO2 emission reduction from China’s clean air actions between 2013-2020,"Climate change mitigation measures can yield substantial air quality improvements while emerging clean air measures in developing countries can also lead to CO2 emission mitigation co-benefits by affecting the local energy system. Here, we evaluate the effect of China’s stringent clean air actions on its energy use and CO2 emissions from 2013-2020. We find that widespread phase-out and upgrades of outdated, polluting, and inefficient combustion facilities during clean air actions have promoted the transformation of the country’s energy system. The co-benefits of China’s clean air measures far outweigh the additional CO2 emissions of end-of-pipe devices, realizing a net accumulative reduction of 2.43 Gt CO2 from 2013-2020, exceeding the accumulated CO2 emission increase in China (2.03 Gt CO2) during the same period. Our study indicates that China’s efforts to tackle air pollution induce considerable climate benefit, and measures with remarkable CO2 reduction co-benefits deserve further attention in future policy design.","China’s clean air action stimulated a net accumulative reduction of 2.43 Gt CO2 emission from 2013-2020. Phase-out and upgrades of outdated, polluting, and inefficient combustion facilities have promoted the transition of the country’s energy system.",2022-08-27
505,Reversal of the renal hyperglycemic memory in diabetic kidney disease by targeting sustained tubular p21 expression,"A major obstacle in diabetes is the metabolic or hyperglycemic memory, which lacks specific therapies. Here we show that glucose-mediated changes in gene expression largely persist in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) despite reversing hyperglycemia. The senescence-associated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Cdkn1a) was the top hit among genes persistently induced by hyperglycemia and was associated with induction of the p53-p21 pathway. Persistent p21 induction was confirmed in various animal models, human samples and in vitro models. Tubular and urinary p21-levels were associated with DKD severity and remained elevated despite improved blood glucose levels in humans. Mechanistically, sustained tubular p21 expression in DKD is linked to demethylation of its promoter and reduced DNMT1 expression. Two disease resolving agents, protease activated protein C (3K3A-aPC) and parmodulin-2, reversed sustained tubular p21 expression, tubular senescence, and DKD. Thus, p21-dependent tubular senescence is a pathway contributing to the hyperglycemic memory, which can be therapeutically targeted.","Persistent diabetic complications despite controlled blood glucose levels, known as hyperglycemic memory, remain a poorly understood phenomenon in diabetic kidney disease. Here the authors identify senescence-associated gene p21 as a regulator of hyperglycemic memory, the suppression of which improves hyperglycemic memory and renal function.",2022-08-27
506,Fast DNA-PAINT imaging using a deep neural network,"DNA points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) is a super-resolution technique with relatively easy-to-implement multi-target imaging. However, image acquisition is slow as sufficient statistical data has to be generated from spatio-temporally isolated single emitters. Here, we train the neural network (NN) DeepSTORM to predict fluorophore positions from high emitter density DNA-PAINT data. This achieves image acquisition in one minute. We demonstrate multi-colour super-resolution imaging of structure-conserved semi-thin neuronal tissue and imaging of large samples. This improvement can be integrated into any single-molecule imaging modality to enable fast single-molecule super-resolution microscopy.",DNA-PAINT image acquisition is limited by speed. Here the authors use the neural network DeepSTORM to predict fluorophore positions from high emitter density DNA-PAINT data in order to achieve image acquisition in one minute; they demonstrate multi-colour and large-area imaging of semi-thin neuronal tissue.,2022-08-27
507,Repurposing the mitotic machinery to drive cellular elongation and chromatin reorganisation in Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes,"The sexual stage gametocytes of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, adopt a falciform (crescent) shape driven by the assembly of a network of microtubules anchored to a cisternal inner membrane complex (IMC). Using 3D electron microscopy, we show that a non-mitotic microtubule organizing center (MTOC), embedded in the parasite’s nuclear membrane, orients the endoplasmic reticulum and the nascent IMC and seeds cytoplasmic microtubules. A bundle of microtubules extends into the nuclear lumen, elongating the nuclear envelope and capturing the chromatin. Classical mitotic machinery components, including centriolar plaque proteins, Pfcentrin-1 and −4, microtubule-associated protein, End-binding protein-1, kinetochore protein, PfNDC80 and centromere-associated protein, PfCENH3, are involved in the nuclear microtubule assembly/disassembly process. Depolymerisation of the microtubules using trifluralin prevents elongation and disrupts the chromatin, centromere and kinetochore organisation. We show that the unusual non-mitotic hemispindle plays a central role in chromatin organisation, IMC positioning and subpellicular microtubule formation in gametocytes.","The sexual blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum develop through five morphologically distinct stages culminating in mature crescent-shaped gametocytes that can be transmitted from the mammalian host to the mosquito vector. Here, Li et al. apply different microscopy and tomography approaches to characterize how the microtubule organizing center and cytoplasmic and nuclear microtubules are organized and oriented during these different stages in the absence of genome replication and mitosis.",2022-08-27
508,"Asymmetric 1,4-functionalization of 1,3-enynes via dual photoredox and chromium catalysis","The merger of photoredox and transition-metal catalysis has evolved as a robust platform in organic synthesis over the past decade. The stereoselective 1,4-functionalization of 1,3-enynes, a prevalent synthon in synthetic chemistry, could afford valuable chiral allene derivatives. However, tremendous efforts have been focused on the ionic reaction pathway. The radical-involved asymmetric 1,4-functionalization of 1,3-enynes remains a prominent challenge. Herein, we describe the asymmetric three-component 1,4-dialkylation of 1,3-enynes via dual photoredox and chromium catalysis to provide chiral allenols. This method features readily available starting materials, broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, high regioselectivity, and simultaneous control of axial and central chiralities. Mechanistic studies suggest that this reaction proceeds through a radical-involved redox-neutral pathway.","In contrast to the better-studied ionic pathway, radical-involved asymmetric 1,4-functionalization of 1,3-enynes remains a prominent challenge. Here, the authors describe the asymmetric three-component 1,4-dialkylation of 1,3-enynes via dual photoredox and chromium catalysis to provide chiral allenols.",2022-08-26
509,Midkine expression by stem-like tumor cells drives persistence to mTOR inhibition and an immune-suppressive microenvironment,"mTORC1 is hyperactive in multiple cancer types1,2. Here, we performed integrative analysis of single cell transcriptomic profiling, paired T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, and spatial transcriptomic profiling on Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) associated tumors with mTORC1 hyperactivity, and identified a stem-like tumor cell state (SLS) linked to T cell dysfunction via tumor-modulated immunosuppressive macrophages. Rapamycin and its derivatives (rapalogs) are the primary treatments for TSC tumors, and the stem-like tumor cells showed rapamycin resistance in vitro, reminiscent of the cytostatic effects of these drugs in patients. The pro-angiogenic factor midkine (MDK) was highly expressed by the SLS population, and associated with enrichment of endothelial cells in SLS-dominant samples. Inhibition of MDK showed synergistic benefit with rapamycin in reducing the growth of TSC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. In aggregate, this study suggests an autocrine rapamycin resistance mechanism and a paracrine tumor survival mechanism via immune suppression adopted by the stem-like state tumor cells with mTORC1 hyperactivity.","The tumour microenvironment in mTORC1 hyperactive cancers remains poorly characterised. Here, integrative analysis in tuberous sclerosis complex tumours with mTORC1 hyperactivity suggests distinct cell states associated with rapamycin resistance and immune modulation.",2022-08-26
510,Efficient DNA fluorescence labeling via base excision trapping,"Fluorescence labeling of DNAs is broadly useful, but methods for labeling are expensive and labor-intensive. Here we describe a general method for fluorescence labeling of oligonucleotides readily and cost-efficiently via base excision trapping (BETr), employing deaminated DNA bases to mark label positions, which are excised by base excision repair enzymes generating AP sites. Specially designed aminooxy-substituted rotor dyes trap the AP sites, yielding high emission intensities. BETr is orthogonal to DNA synthesis by polymerases, enabling multi-uracil incorporation into an amplicon and in situ BETr labeling without washing. BETr also enables labeling of dsDNA such as genomic DNA at a high labeling density in a single tube by use of nick translation. Use of two different deaminated bases facilitates two-color site-specific labeling. Use of a multi-labeled DNA construct as a bright fluorescence tag is demonstrated through the conjugation to an antibody for imaging proteins. Finally, double-strand selectivity of a repair enzyme is harnessed in sensitive reporting on the presence of a target DNA or RNA in a mixture with isothermal turnover and single nucleotide specificity. Overall, the results document a convenient and versatile method for general fluorescence labeling of DNAs.",Methods for fluorescently labelling DNAs are expensive and labour-intensive. Here the authors report an in situ DNA labelling strategy for oligonucleotides as well as dsDNA that makes use of aldehyde-reactive rotor dyes to trap AP sites resulting from excision of deaminated DNA bases.,2022-08-26
511,Liquid-infused microstructured bioadhesives halt non-compressible hemorrhage,"Non-compressible hemorrhage is an unmet clinical challenge that accounts for high mortality in trauma. Rapid pressurized blood flows under hemorrhage impair the function and integrity of hemostatic agents and the adhesion of bioadhesive sealants. Here, we report the design and performance of bioinspired microstructured bioadhesives, formed with a macroporous tough xerogel infused with functional liquids. The xerogel can rapidly absorb interfacial fluids such as whole blood and promote blood clotting, while the infused liquids facilitate interfacial bonding, sealing, and antibacterial function. Their synergy enables the bioadhesives to form tough adhesion on ex vivo human and porcine tissues and diverse engineered surfaces without the need for compression, as well as on-demand instant removal and storage stability. We demonstrate a significantly improved hemostatic efficacy and biocompatibility in rats and pigs compared to non-structured counterparts and commercial products. This work opens new avenues for the development of bioadhesives and hemostatic sealants.",Non‐compressible wounds are a major source of high mortality in trauma victims. Here the authors report on the creation of xerogels impregnated with liquid adhesives which can rapidly absorb fluids promoting blood clotting while forming adhesions to tissue and demonstrate the xerogel in ex vivo and in vivo models.,2022-08-26
512,DAXX-ATRX regulation of p53 chromatin binding and DNA damage response,"DAXX and ATRX are tumor suppressor proteins that form a histone H3.3 chaperone complex and are frequently mutated in cancers with the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Here, we show that DAXX and ATRX knock-out (KO) U87-T cells that have acquired ALT-like features have defects in p53 chromatin binding and DNA damage response. RNA-seq analysis revealed that p53 pathway is among the most perturbed. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq revealed a genome-wide reduction in p53 DNA-binding and corresponding loss of chromatin accessibility at many p53 response elements across the genome. Both DAXX and ATRX null cells showed a depletion of histone H3.3 and accumulation of γH2AX at many p53 sites, including subtelomeres. These findings indicate that loss of DAXX or ATRX can compromise p53 chromatin binding and p53 DNA damage response in ALT-like cells, providing a link between histone composition, chromatin accessibility and tumor suppressor function of p53.",The tumor suppressor proteins DAXX and ATRX are frequently mutated in cancers with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). This study shows that DAXX-ATRX regulates p53 chromatin accessibility and DNA damage response and that disruption of this pathway is critical for ALT cell survival.,2022-08-26
513,Pneumolysin boosts the neuroinflammatory response to Streptococcus pneumoniae through enhanced endocytosis,"In pneumococcal meningitis, bacterial growth in the cerebrospinal fluid results in lysis, the release of toxic factors, and subsequent neuroinflammation. Exposure of primary murine glia to Streptococcus pneumoniae lysates leads to strong proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, blocked by inhibition of the intracellular innate receptor Nod1. Lysates enhance dynamin-dependent endocytosis, and dynamin inhibition reduces neuroinflammation, blocking ligand internalization. Here we identify the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin pneumolysin as a pro-endocytotic factor in lysates, its elimination reduces their proinflammatory effect. Only pore-competent pneumolysin enhances endocytosis in a dynamin-, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase- and potassium-dependent manner. Endocytic enhancement is limited to toxin-exposed parts of the membrane, the effect is rapid and pneumolysin permanently alters membrane dynamics. In a murine model of pneumococcal meningitis, mice treated with chlorpromazine, a neuroleptic with a complementary endocytosis inhibitory effect show reduced neuroinflammation. Thus, the dynamin-dependent endocytosis emerges as a factor in pneumococcal neuroinflammation, and its enhancement by a cytolysin represents a proinflammatory control mechanism.","Pneumococcal infection of the cerebrospinal fluid results in bacterial lysis, the release of toxic factors and induction of neuroinflammation. Here, the authors show that the virulence factor pneumolysin enhances the neuroinflammatory response to Streptococcus pneumoniae by the enhancement of endocytosis.",2022-08-26
514,Structure of the human NK cell NKR-P1:LLT1 receptor:ligand complex reveals clustering in the immune synapse,"Signaling by the human C-type lectin-like receptor, natural killer (NK) cell inhibitory receptor NKR-P1, has a critical role in many immune-related diseases and cancer. C-type lectin-like receptors have weak affinities to their ligands; therefore, setting up a comprehensive model of NKR-P1-LLT1 interactions that considers the natural state of the receptor on the cell surface is necessary to understand its functions. Here we report the crystal structures of the NKR-P1 and NKR-P1:LLT1 complexes, which provides evidence that NKR-P1 forms homodimers in an unexpected arrangement to enable LLT1 binding in two modes, bridging two LLT1 molecules. These interaction clusters are suggestive of an inhibitory immune synapse. By observing the formation of these clusters in solution using SEC-SAXS analysis, by dSTORM super-resolution microscopy on the cell surface, and by following their role in receptor signaling with freshly isolated NK cells, we show that only the ligation of both LLT1 binding interfaces leads to effective NKR-P1 inhibitory signaling. In summary, our findings collectively support a model of NKR-P1:LLT1 clustering, which allows the interacting proteins to overcome weak ligand-receptor affinity and to trigger signal transduction upon cellular contact in the immune synapse.","NKR-P1 is an inhibitory receptor on the surface of natural killer cells, and its engagement with the ligand LLT1 on activated monocytes and B cells triggers NK cell self-tolerance and other immunological processes. Here authors set up a comprehensive, structure-based model of NKR-P1-LLT1 interaction that involves NKR-P1 homodimer formation and subsequent bridging of two LLT1 molecules.",2022-08-26
515,BRAT1 links Integrator and defective RNA processing with neurodegeneration,"Mutations in BRAT1, encoding BRCA1-associated ATM activator 1, have been associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders characterized by heterogeneous phenotypes with varying levels of clinical severity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease pathology remain poorly understood. Here, we show that BRAT1 tightly interacts with INTS9/INTS11 subunits of the Integrator complex that processes 3’ ends of various noncoding RNAs and pre-mRNAs. We find that Integrator functions are disrupted by BRAT1 deletion. In particular, defects in BRAT1 impede proper 3’ end processing of UsnRNAs and snoRNAs, replication-dependent histone pre-mRNA processing, and alter the expression of protein-coding genes. Importantly, impairments in Integrator function are also evident in patient-derived cells from BRAT1 related neurological disease. Collectively, our data suggest that defects in BRAT1 interfere with proper Integrator functions, leading to incorrect expression of RNAs and proteins, resulting in neurodegeneration.","Mutations in BRAT1 are associated with neurodevelopmental delay and neurodegeneration. Here, the authors show that BRAT1 is a component of Integrator and is important for processing of specific RNAs. They further demonstrate that BRAT1 mutant patient-derived cells exhibit reduced levels of the Integrator catalytic subunit and increased levels of misprocessed UsnRNAs and impaired RNA processing.",2022-08-26
516,Decomposing virulence to understand bacterial clearance in persistent infections,"Following an infection, hosts cannot always clear the pathogen, instead either dying or surviving with a persistent infection. Such variation is ecologically and evolutionarily important because it can affect infection prevalence and transmission, and virulence evolution. However, the factors causing variation in infection outcomes, and the relationship between clearance and virulence are not well understood. Here we show that sustained persistent infection and clearance are both possible outcomes across bacterial species showing a range of virulence in Drosophila melanogaster. Variation in virulence arises because of differences in the two components of virulence: bacterial infection intensity inside the host (exploitation), and the amount of damage caused per bacterium (per parasite pathogenicity). As early-phase exploitation increased, clearance rates later in the infection decreased, whereas there was no apparent effect of per parasite pathogenicity on clearance rates. Variation in infection outcomes is thereby determined by how virulence – and its components – relate to the rate of pathogen clearance. Taken together we demonstrate that the virulence decomposition framework is broadly applicable and can provide valuable insights into host-pathogen interactions.","The relationship between virulence and pathogen clearance is not well understood. Here, using bacterial infections in Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, the authors demonstrate an approach to disentangle the drivers of virulence and assess their relation to pathogen clearance rate.",2022-08-26
517,Spatially patterned hydrogen peroxide orchestrates stomatal development in Arabidopsis,"Stomatal pores allow gas exchange between plant and atmosphere. Stomatal development is regulated by multiple intrinsic developmental and environmental signals. Here, we show that spatially patterned hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays an essential role in stomatal development. H2O2 is remarkably enriched in meristemoids, which is established by spatial expression patterns of H2O2-scavenging enzyme CAT2 and APX1. SPEECHLESS (SPCH), a master regulator of stomatal development, directly binds to the promoters of CAT2 and APX1 to repress their expression in meristemoid cells. Mutations in CAT2 or APX1 result in an increased stomatal index. Ectopic expression of CAT2 driven by SPCH promoter significantly inhibits the stomatal development. Furthermore, H2O2 activates the energy sensor SnRK1 by inducing the nuclear localization of the catalytic α-subunit KIN10, which stabilizes SPCH to promote stomatal development. Overall, these results demonstrate that the spatial pattern of H2O2 in epidermal leaves is critical for the optimal stomatal development in Arabidopsis.","Stomatal development is regulated by multiple intrinsic developmental and environmental signals. Here, the authors show that spatially patterned hydrogen peroxide activates the energy sensor SnRK1 to stabilize the SPCH transcription factor and optimize stomatal development in Arabidopsis.",2022-08-26
518,The CCTG PA.7 phase II trial of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel with or without durvalumab and tremelimumab as initial therapy in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,"Immunotherapy-based monotherapy treatment in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) has shown limited benefit outside of the mismatch repair deficiency setting, while safety and efficacy of combining dual-checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy with chemotherapy remains uncertain. Here, we present results from the CCTG PA.7 study (NCT02879318), a randomized phase II trial comparing gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel with and without immune checkpoint inhibitors durvalumab and tremelimumab in 180 patients with mPDAC. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and objective response rate. Results of the trial were negative as combination immunotherapy did not improve survival among the unselected patient population (p = 0.72) and toxicity was limited to elevation of lymphocytes in the combination immunotherapy group (p = 0.02). Exploratory baseline circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing revealed increased survival for patients with KRAS wildtype tumors in both the combination immunotherapy (p = 0.001) and chemotherapy (p = 0.004) groups. These data support the utility of ctDNA analysis in PDAC and the prognostic value of ctDNA-based KRAS mutation status.",Metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) has limited therapeutic options and is associated with a poor prognosis. Here the authors report the results of a randomized phase II trial showing that combining checkpoint inhibitors (durvalumab and tremelimumab) with chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) does not improve survival compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with mPDAC.,2022-08-26
519,AMPK deficiency in smooth muscles causes persistent pulmonary hypertension of the new-born and premature death,"AMPK has been reported to facilitate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction but, paradoxically, its deficiency precipitates pulmonary hypertension. Here we show that AMPK-α1/α2 deficiency in smooth muscles promotes persistent pulmonary hypertension of the new-born. Accordingly, dual AMPK-α1/α2 deletion in smooth muscles causes premature death of mice after birth, associated with increased muscularisation and remodeling throughout the pulmonary arterial tree, reduced alveolar numbers and alveolar membrane thickening, but with no oedema. Spectral Doppler ultrasound indicates pulmonary hypertension and attenuated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Age-dependent right ventricular pressure elevation, dilation and reduced cardiac output was also evident. KV1.5 potassium currents of pulmonary arterial myocytes were markedly smaller under normoxia, which is known to facilitate pulmonary hypertension. Mitochondrial fragmentation and reactive oxygen species accumulation was also evident. Importantly, there was no evidence of systemic vasculopathy or hypertension in these mice. Moreover, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction was attenuated by AMPK-α1 or AMPK-α2 deletion without triggering pulmonary hypertension.","AMPK modulates idiopathic and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in adults, largely via unknown mechanisms. Here, the authors show that AMPK deficiency in smooth muscles causes persistent pulmonary hypertension of the new born and premature death in mice, due to increased muscularisation and remodeling of pulmonary arteries, reduced alveolar numbers and alveolar membrane thickening",2022-08-26
520,Water-organizing motif continuity is critical for potent ice nucleation protein activity,"Bacterial ice nucleation proteins (INPs) can cause frost damage to plants by nucleating ice formation at high sub-zero temperatures. Modeling of Pseudomonas borealis INP by AlphaFold suggests that the central domain of 65 tandem sixteen-residue repeats forms a beta-solenoid with arrays of outward-pointing threonines and tyrosines, which may organize water molecules into an ice-like pattern. Here we report that mutating some of these residues in a central segment of P. borealis INP, expressed in Escherichia coli, decreases ice nucleation activity more than the section’s deletion. Insertion of a bulky domain has the same effect, indicating that the continuity of the water-organizing repeats is critical for optimal activity. The ~10 C-terminal coils differ from the other 55 coils in being more basic and lacking water-organizing motifs; deletion of this region eliminates INP activity. We show through sequence modifications how arrays of conserved motifs form the large ice-nucleating surface required for potency.","Ice nucleation proteins have the same tandemly arrayed water-organizing motifs seen in some antifreeze proteins, but on a larger scale. The authors show that mutation, interruption, and truncation of these arrays reduce ice nucleation activity indicating that the two protein types share a common mechanism.",2022-08-26
521,Touchless interactive teaching of soft robots through flexible bimodal sensory interfaces,"In this paper, we propose a multimodal flexible sensory interface for interactively teaching soft robots to perform skilled locomotion using bare human hands. First, we develop a flexible bimodal smart skin (FBSS) based on triboelectric nanogenerator and liquid metal sensing that can perform simultaneous tactile and touchless sensing and distinguish these two modes in real time. With the FBSS, soft robots can react on their own to tactile and touchless stimuli. We then propose a distance control method that enabled humans to teach soft robots movements via bare hand-eye coordination. The results showed that participants can effectively teach a self-reacting soft continuum manipulator complex motions in three-dimensional space through a “shifting sensors and teaching” method within just a few minutes. The soft manipulator can repeat the human-taught motions and replay them at different speeds. Finally, we demonstrate that humans can easily teach the soft manipulator to complete specific tasks such as completing a pen-and-paper maze, taking a throat swab, and crossing a barrier to grasp an object. We envision that this user-friendly, non-programmable teaching method based on flexible multimodal sensory interfaces could broadly expand the domains in which humans interact with and utilize soft robots.","Soft robots are challenging to model and program. Non-specialists face non-negligible obstacles when working with soft robots to perform tasks. Here, the authors propose a method to interactively teach soft robots complex motions through flexible touchless and tactile multimodal sensors.",2022-08-26
522,High-surface-area corundum nanoparticles by resistive hotspot-induced phase transformation,"High-surface-area α-Al2O3 nanoparticles are used in high-strength ceramics and stable catalyst supports. The production of α-Al2O3 by phase transformation from γ-Al2O3 is hampered by a high activation energy barrier, which usually requires extended high-temperature annealing (~1500 K, > 10 h) and suffers from aggregation. Here, we report the synthesis of dehydrated α-Al2O3 nanoparticles (phase purity ~100%, particle size ~23 nm, surface area ~65 m2 g−1) by a pulsed direct current Joule heating of γ-Al2O3. The phase transformation is completed at a reduced bulk temperature and duration (~573 K, < 1 s) via an intermediate δʹ-Al2O3 phase. Numerical simulations reveal the resistive hotspot-induced local heating in the pulsed current process enables the rapid transformation. Theoretical calculations show the topotactic transition (from γ- to δʹ- to α-Al2O3) is driven by their surface energy differences. The α-Al2O3 nanoparticles are sintered to nanograined ceramics with hardness superior to commercial alumina and approaching that of sapphire.","High-surface-area corundum are used in ceramics and catalyst supports, yet the synthesis is hampered by high energy barrier and aggregation.

523,Magnetically assisted drop-on-demand 3D printing of microstructured multimaterial composites,"Microstructured composites with hierarchically arranged fillers fabricated by three-dimensional (3D) printing show enhanced properties along the fillers’ alignment direction. However, it is still challenging to achieve good control of the filler arrangement and high filler concentration simultaneously, which limits the printed material’s properties. In this study, we develop a magnetically assisted drop-on-demand 3D printing technique (MDOD) to print aligned microplatelet reinforced composites. By performing drop-on-demand printing using aqueous slurry inks while applying an external magnetic field, MDOD can print composites with microplatelet fillers aligned at set angles with high filler concentrations up to 50 vol%. Moreover, MDOD allows multimaterial printing with voxelated control. We showcase the capabilities of MDOD by printing multimaterial piezoresistive sensors with tunable performances based on the local microstructure and composition. MDOD thus creates a large design space to enhance the mechanical and functional properties of 3D printed electronic or sensing devices using a wide range of materials.","3D printed composites with hierarchically arranged fillers have been challenging to fabricate. Here, the authors make use of magnetically assisted droplet-based printing to 3D print voxelated structures with high filler content, localized control of filler material, and orientation.",2022-08-26
524,Specificity of the Hox member Deformed is determined by transcription factor levels and binding site affinities,"Hox proteins have similar binding specificities in vitro, yet they control different morphologies in vivo. This paradox has been partially solved with the identification of Hox low-affinity binding sites. However, anterior Hox proteins are more promiscuous than posterior Hox proteins, raising the question how anterior Hox proteins achieve specificity. We use the AP2x enhancer, which is activated in the maxillary head segment by the Hox TF Deformed (Dfd). This enhancer lacks canonical Dfd-Exd sites but contains several predicted low-affinity sites. Unexpectedly, these sites are strongly bound by Dfd-Exd complexes and their conversion into optimal Dfd-Exd sites results only in a modest increase in binding strength. These small variations in affinity change the sensitivity of the enhancer to different Dfd levels, resulting in perturbed AP-2 expression and maxillary morphogenesis. Thus, Hox-regulated morphogenesis seems to result from the co-evolution of Hox binding affinity and Hox dosage for precise target gene regulation.","Despite the central role of Hox genes in controlling morphogenesis, the DNA binding of different Hox members is relatively similar. Here they show that specificity of Hox member Dfd relies on a precise balance of transcription factors and binding site affinities.",2022-08-26
525,Perforin-2 clockwise hand-over-hand pre-pore to pore transition mechanism,"Perforin-2 (PFN2, MPEG1) is a pore-forming protein that acts as a first line of defense in the mammalian immune system, rapidly killing engulfed microbes within the phagolysosome in macrophages. PFN2 self-assembles into hexadecameric pre-pore rings that transition upon acidification into pores damaging target cell membranes. Here, using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) imaging and line-scanning and molecular dynamics simulation, we elucidate PFN2 pre-pore to pore transition pathways and dynamics. Upon acidification, the pre-pore rings (pre-pore-I) display frequent, 1.8 s−1, ring-opening dynamics that eventually, 0.2 s−1, initiate transition into an intermediate, short-lived, ~75 ms, pre-pore-II state, inducing a clockwise pre-pore-I to pre-pore-II propagation. Concomitantly, the first pre-pore-II subunit, undergoes a major conformational change to the pore state that propagates also clockwise at a rate ~15 s−1. Thus, the pre-pore to pore transition is a clockwise hand-over-hand mechanism that is accomplished within ~1.3 s. Our findings suggest a clockwise mechanism of membrane insertion that with variations may be general for the MACPF/CDC superfamily.",Direct visualization of the structural transformation from pre-pore to pore of the mammalian immune defense complex perforin-2 (PFN2) reveals a clockwise hand-over-hand mechanism that propagates at ~15 subunits per second.,2022-08-26
526,Balancing national economic policy outcomes for sustainable development,"The 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim at jointly improving economic, social, and environmental outcomes for human prosperity and planetary health. However, designing national economic policies that support advancement across multiple Sustainable Development Goals is hindered by the complexities of multi-sector economies and often conflicting policies. To address this, we introduce a national-scale design framework that can enable policymakers to sift through complex, non-linear, multi-sector policy spaces to identify efficient policy portfolios that balance economic, social, and environmental goals. The framework combines economy-wide sustainability simulation and artificial intelligence-driven multiobjective, multi-SDG policy search and machine learning. The framework can support multi-sector, multi-actor policy deliberation to screen efficient policy portfolios. We demonstrate the utility of the framework for a case study of Egypt by identifying policy portfolios that achieve efficient mixes of poverty and inequality reduction, economic growth, and climate change mitigation. The results show that integrated policy strategies can help achieve sustainable development while balancing adverse economic, social, and political impacts of reforms.",Selecting economic policies to achieve sustainable development is challenging due to the many sectors involved and the trade-offs implied. Artificial intelligence combined with economy-wide computer simulations can help.,2022-08-26
527,Multivalent interactions between molecular components involved in fast endophilin mediated endocytosis drive protein phase separation,"A specific group of transmembrane receptors, including the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR), is internalized through a non-clathrin pathway known as Fast Endophilin Mediated Endocytosis (FEME). A key question is: how does the endocytic machinery assemble and how is it modulated by activated receptors during FEME. Here we show that endophilin, a major regulator of FEME, undergoes a phase transition into liquid-like condensates, which facilitates the formation of multi-protein assemblies by enabling the phase partitioning of endophilin binding proteins. The phase transition can be triggered by specific multivalent binding partners of endophilin in the FEME pathway such as the third intracellular loop (TIL) of the β1-AR, and the C-terminal domain of lamellipodin (LPD). Other endocytic accessory proteins can either partition into, or target interfacial regions of, these condensate droplets, and LPD also phase separates with the actin polymerase VASP. On the membrane, TIL promotes protein clustering in the presence of endophilin and LPD C-terminal domain. Our results demonstrate how the multivalent interactions between endophilin, LPD, and TIL regulate protein assembly formation on the membrane, providing mechanistic insights into the priming and initiation steps of FEME.",Here the authors show that protein phase separation is a key mechanism in cellular receptor internalization via fast endophilin mediated endocytosis (FEME). Phase separation facilitates multivalent FEME-protein assembly in this clathrin-independent pathway.,2022-08-26
528,Inequality can double the energy required to secure universal decent living,"Ecological breakdown and economic inequality are among the largest contemporary global challenges, and the issues are thoroughly entangled – as they have been throughout the history of civilisations. Yet, the global economy continues toward ecological crises, and inequalities remain far higher than citizens believe to be fair. Here, we explore the role of inequality, alongside traditional drivers of ecological impacts, in determining global energy requirements for providing universal decent living. We consider scenarios from fair inequality – where inequalities mirror public ideals – through a fairly unequal world, to one with a super-rich global elite. The energy-costs of inequality appear far more significant than population: even fair levels increase the energy required to provide universal decent living by 40%, and a super-rich global 1% could consume as much energy as would providing decent living to 1.7 billion. We finish by arguing that total population remains important nonetheless, but for reasons beyond ecological impacts.","In exploring the energy required to provide decent living for all, the authors find the costs of inequality to be far greater than that of population growth. Nonetheless, population growth remains important for other reasons.",2022-08-26
529,A ribosomally synthesised and post-translationally modified peptide containing a β-enamino acid and a macrocyclic motif,"Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are structurally complex natural products with diverse bioactivities. Here we report discovery of a RiPP, kintamdin, for which the structure is determined through spectroscopy, spectrometry and genomic analysis to feature a bis-thioether macrocyclic ring and a β-enamino acid residue. Biosynthetic investigation demonstrated that its pathway relies on four dedicated proteins: phosphotransferase KinD, Lyase KinC, kinase homolog KinH and flavoprotein KinI, which share low homologues to enzymes known in other RiPP biosynthesis. During the posttranslational modifications, KinCD is responsible for the formation of the characteristic dehydroamino acid residues including the β-enamino acid residue, followed by oxidative decarboxylation on the C-terminal Cys and subsequent cyclization to provide the bis-thioether ring moiety mediated by coordinated action of KinH and KinI. Finally, conserved genomic investigation allows further identification of two kintamdin-like peptides among the kin-like BGCs, suggesting the occurrence of RiPPs from actinobacteria.","The chemical diversity of peptides from ribosomal origin is a growing field of research. Here, the authors report the discovery, genomic and biosynthetic investigations of kintamdin, a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides featuring a beta-enamino acid and a bis-thioether macrocyclic motif.",2022-08-26
530,Directed evolution of phosphite dehydrogenase to cycle noncanonical redox cofactors via universal growth selection platform,"Noncanonical redox cofactors are attractive low-cost alternatives to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)+) in biotransformation. However, engineering enzymes to utilize them is challenging. Here, we present a high-throughput directed evolution platform which couples cell growth to the in vivo cycling of a noncanonical cofactor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN+). We achieve this by engineering the life-essential glutathione reductase in Escherichia coli to exclusively rely on the reduced NMN+ (NMNH). Using this system, we develop a phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH) to cycle NMN+ with ~147-fold improved catalytic efficiency, which translates to an industrially viable total turnover number of ~45,000 in cell-free biotransformation without requiring high cofactor concentrations. Moreover, the PTDH variants also exhibit improved activity with another structurally deviant noncanonical cofactor, 1-benzylnicotinamide (BNA+), showcasing their broad applications. Structural modeling prediction reveals a general design principle where the mutations and the smaller, noncanonical cofactors together mimic the steric interactions of the larger, natural cofactors NAD(P)+.","Engineering enzymes to utilize the noncanonical redox cofactors such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN + ) is challenging. Here, the authors report a growth-based selection platform for NMN + -reducing enzyme engineering and show its application in developing a phosphite dehydrogenase with improved catalytic efficiency.",2022-08-26
531,The protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT9 attenuates MAVS activation through arginine methylation,"The signaling adaptor MAVS forms prion-like aggregates to activate the innate antiviral immune response after viral infection. However, spontaneous aggregation of MAVS can lead to autoimmune diseases. The molecular mechanism that prevents MAVS from spontaneous aggregation in resting cells has been enigmatic. Here we report that protein arginine methyltransferase 9 targets MAVS directly and catalyzes the arginine methylation of MAVS at the Arg41 and Arg43. In the resting state, this modification inhibits MAVS aggregation and autoactivation of MAVS. Upon virus infection, PRMT9 dissociates from the mitochondria, leading to the aggregation and activation of MAVS. Our study implicates a form of post-translational modification on MAVS, which can keep MAVS inactive in physiological conditions to maintain innate immune homeostasis.",The anti-viral protein MAVS forms aggregates as part of the antiviral response and promoting type I IFN responses. Here the authors show that protein arginine methyltransferase 9 (PRMT9) methylates MAVS to keep the protein in a non-aggregated state and propose a regulatory mechanism for MAVS.,2022-08-26
532,Tropical volcanoes synchronize eastern Canada with Northern Hemisphere millennial temperature variability,"Although global and Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions are coherent with climate model simulations over the last millennium, reconstructed temperatures tend to diverge from simulations at smaller spatial scales. Yet, it remains unclear to what extent these regional peculiarities reflect region-specific internal climate variability or inadequate proxy coverage and quality. Here, we present a high-quality, millennial-long summer temperature reconstruction for northeastern North America, based on maximum latewood density, the most temperature-sensitive tree-ring proxy. Our reconstruction shows that a large majority (31 out of 44) of the coldest extremes can be attributed to explosive volcanic eruptions, with more persistent cooling following large tropical than extratropical events. These forced climate variations synchronize regional summer temperatures with hemispheric reconstructions and simulations at the multidecadal time scale. Our study highlights that tropical volcanism is the major driver of multidecadal temperature variations across spatial scales.","A maximum latewood density based summer temperature reconstruction from eastern Canada shows recent warming is unprecedented over 1246 years, and tropical volcanism synchronizes regional and hemispheric summer temperatures at the multidecadal time scale.",2022-08-26
533,Towards critical white ice conditions in lakes under global warming,"The quality of lake ice is of uppermost importance for ice safety and under-ice ecology, but its temporal and spatial variability is largely unknown. Here we conducted a coordinated lake ice quality sampling campaign across the Northern Hemisphere during one of the warmest winters since 1880 and show that lake ice during 2020/2021 commonly consisted of unstable white ice, at times contributing up to 100% to the total ice thickness. We observed that white ice increased over the winter season, becoming thickest and constituting the largest proportion of the ice layer towards the end of the ice cover season when fatal winter drownings occur most often and light limits the growth and reproduction of primary producers. We attribute the dominance of white ice before ice-off to air temperatures varying around the freezing point, a condition which occurs more frequently during warmer winters. Thus, under continued global warming, the prevalence of white ice is likely to substantially increase during the critical period before ice-off, for which we adjusted commonly used equations for human ice safety and light transmittance through ice.","Under continued global warming, lakes will increasingly be covered by white ice, in particular towards the end of the ice cover season when fatal winter drownings occur most often and light limits the growth and reproduction of primary producers.",2022-08-25
534,Ultrafast pseudospin quantum beats in multilayer WSe2 and MoSe2,"Layered van-der-Waals materials with hexagonal symmetry offer an extra degree of freedom to their electrons, the so-called valley index or valley pseudospin, which behaves conceptually like the electron spin. Here, we present investigations of excitonic transitions in mono- and multilayer WSe2 and MoSe2 materials by time-resolved Faraday ellipticity (TRFE) with in-plane magnetic fields, B∥, of up to 9 T. In monolayer samples, the measured TRFE time traces are almost independent of B∥, which confirms a close to zero in-plane exciton g factor g∥, consistent with first-principles calculations. In contrast, we observe pronounced temporal oscillations in multilayer samples for B∥ > 0. Our first-principles calculations confirm the presence of a non-zero g∥ for the multilayer samples. We propose that the oscillatory TRFE signal in the multilayer samples is caused by pseudospin quantum beats of excitons, which is a manifestation of spin- and pseudospin layer locking in the multilayer samples.","Here, the authors investigate excitonic transitions in mono- and multi-layer WSe2 and MoSe2 by time-resolved Faraday ellipticity (TRFE) with in-plane magnetic fields, and attribute the oscillatory TRFE signal in the multilayer samples to pseudospin quantum beats of excitons, a manifestation of spin- and pseudospin layer locking.",2022-08-25
535,An interplay between cellular growth and atypical fusion defines morphogenesis of a modular glial niche in Drosophila,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) live in an intricate cellular microenvironment supporting their activity, the niche. Whilst shape and function are inseparable, the morphogenetic aspects of niche development are poorly understood. Here, we use the formation of a glial niche to investigate acquisition of architectural complexity. Cortex glia (CG) in Drosophila regulate neurogenesis and build a reticular structure around NSCs. We first show that individual CG cells grow tremendously to ensheath several NSC lineages, employing elaborate proliferative mechanisms which convert these cells into syncytia rich in cytoplasmic bridges. CG syncytia further undergo homotypic cell–cell fusion, using defined cell surface receptors and actin regulators. Cellular exchange is however dynamic in space and time. This atypical cell fusion remodels cellular borders, restructuring the CG syncytia. Ultimately, combined growth and fusion builds the multi-level architecture of the niche, and creates a modular, spatial partition of the NSC population. Our findings provide insights into how a niche forms and organises while developing intimate contacts with a stem cell population.",Little is known of how the architectural complexity of the neural stem cell niche is achieved. Rujano et al. show that the morphogenesis of a glial niche in Drosophila involves complex proliferative strategies and atypical cell–cell fusion.,2022-08-25
536,Co-assembled perylene/graphene oxide photosensitive heterobilayer for efficient neuromorphics,"Neuromorphic electronics, which use artificial photosensitive synapses, can emulate biological nervous systems with in-memory sensing and computing abilities. Benefiting from multiple intra/interactions and strong light-matter coupling, two-dimensional heterostructures are promising synaptic materials for photonic synapses. Two primary strategies, including chemical vapor deposition and physical stacking, have been developed for layered heterostructures, but large-scale growth control over wet-chemical synthesis with comprehensive efficiency remains elusive. Here we demonstrate an interfacial coassembly heterobilayer films from perylene and graphene oxide (GO) precursors, which are spontaneously formed at the interface, with uniform bilayer structure of single-crystal perylene and well-stacked GO over centimeters in size. The planar heterostructure device exhibits an ultrahigh specific detectivity of 3.1 × 1013 Jones and ultralow energy consumption of 10−9 W as well as broadband photoperception from 365 to 1550 nm. Moreover, the device shows outstanding photonic synaptic behaviors with a paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) index of 214% in neuroplasticity, the heterosynapse array has the capability of information reinforcement learning and recognition.","Layered heterostructures are promising photosensitive materials for advanced optoelectronics.

537,Complete classification of steerability under local filters and its relation with measurement incompatibility,"Quantum steering is a central resource for one-sided device-independent quantum information. It is manipulated via one-way local operations and classical communication, such as local filtering on the trusted party. Here, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a steering assemblage to be transformable into another via local filtering. We characterize the equivalence classes with respect to filters in terms of the steering equivalent observables (SEO), first proposed to connect the problem of steerability and measurement incompatibility. We provide an efficient method to compute the extractable steerability that is maximal via local filters and show that it coincides with the incompatibility of the SEO. Moreover, we show that there always exists a bipartite state that provides an assemblage with steerability equal to the incompatibility of the measurements on the untrusted party. Finally, we investigate the optimal success probability and rates for transformation protocols (distillation and dilution) in the single-shot scenario together with examples.","The study of quantum steering has both foundational and practical interest. Here, the authors show that transformability of a steerable resource into another via local filtering at the trusted party is determined by whether they have the same steering equivalent observables (SEO).",2022-08-25
538,Radial bound states in the continuum for polarization-invariant nanophotonics,"All-dielectric nanophotonics underpinned by the physics of bound states in the continuum (BICs) have demonstrated breakthrough applications in nanoscale light manipulation, frequency conversion and optical sensing. Leading BIC implementations range from isolated nanoantennas with localized electromagnetic fields to symmetry-protected metasurfaces with controllable resonance quality (Q) factors. However, they either require structured light illumination with complex beam-shaping optics or large, fabrication-intense arrays of polarization-sensitive unit cells, hindering tailored nanophotonic applications and on-chip integration. Here, we introduce radial quasi-bound states in the continuum (radial BICs) as a new class of radially distributed electromagnetic modes controlled by structural asymmetry in a ring of dielectric rod pair resonators. The radial BIC platform provides polarization-invariant and tunable high-Q resonances with strongly enhanced near fields in an ultracompact footprint as low as 2 µm2. We demonstrate radial BIC realizations in the visible for sensitive biomolecular detection and enhanced second-harmonic generation from monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides, opening new perspectives for compact, spectrally selective, and polarization-invariant metadevices for multi-functional light-matter coupling, multiplexed sensing, and high-density on-chip photonics.","In their work on radial BICs, the authors realize a nanophotonic platform with high resonance Q factors and drastically reduced spatial footprint ideally suited for enhanced on-chip biomolecular sensing and nonlinear light generation.",2022-08-25
539,Designed peptides as nanomolar cross-amyloid inhibitors acting via supramolecular nanofiber co-assembly,"Amyloid self-assembly is linked to numerous devastating cell-degenerative diseases. However, designing inhibitors of this pathogenic process remains a major challenge. Cross-interactions between amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), key polypeptides of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), have been suggested to link AD with T2D pathogenesis. Here, we show that constrained peptides designed to mimic the Aβ amyloid core (ACMs) are nanomolar cross-amyloid inhibitors of both IAPP and Aβ42 and effectively suppress reciprocal cross-seeding. Remarkably, ACMs act by co-assembling with IAPP or Aβ42 into amyloid fibril-resembling but non-toxic nanofibers and their highly ordered superstructures. Co-assembled nanofibers exhibit various potentially beneficial features including thermolability, proteolytic degradability, and effective cellular clearance which are reminiscent of labile/reversible functional amyloids. ACMs are thus promising leads for potent anti-amyloid drugs in both T2D and AD while the supramolecular nanofiber co-assemblies should inform the design of novel functional (hetero-)amyloid-based nanomaterials for biomedical/biotechnological applications.",Amyloid self-assembly is linked to type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease.

540,Thiol-Yne click chemistry of acetylene-enabled macrocyclization,"Macrocycles have fascinated scientists for over half a century due to their aesthetically appealing structures and broad utilities in chemical, material, and biological research. However, the efficient preparation of macrocycles remains an ongoing research challenge in organic synthesis because of the high entropic penalty involved in the ring-closing process. Herein we report a photocatalyzed thiol-yne click reaction to forge diverse sulfur-containing macrocycles (up to 35-membered ring) and linear C2-linked 1,2-(S-S/S-P/S-N) functionalized molecules, starting from the simplest alkyne, acetylene. Preliminary mechanistic experiments support a visible light-mediated radical-polar crossover dihydrothiolation process. This operationally straightforward reaction is also amenable to the synthesis of organometallic complexes, bis-sulfoxide ligand and a pleuromutilin antibiotic drug Tiamulin, which provides a practical route to synthesize highly valued compounds from the feedstock acetylene gas.","Thiol–yne coupling is a reliable method to link two molecular units, but has not been extensively explored for the construction of macrocycles. Here, the authors use gaseous acetylene, the simplest alkyne unit, to synthesize a variety of macrocycles under photocatalytic conditions.",2022-08-25
541,Cholinergic basal forebrain nucleus of Meynert regulates chronic pain-like behavior via modulation of the prelimbic cortex,"The basal nucleus of Meynert (NBM) subserves critically important functions in attention, arousal and cognition via its profound modulation of neocortical activity and is emerging as a key target in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s dementias. Despite the crucial role of neocortical domains in pain perception, however, the NBM has not been studied in models of chronic pain. Here, using in vivo tetrode recordings in behaving mice, we report that beta and gamma oscillatory activity is evoked in the NBM by noxious stimuli and is facilitated at peak inflammatory pain-like behavior. Optogenetic and chemogenetic cell-specific, reversible manipulations of NBM cholinergic-GABAergic neurons reveal their role in endogenous control of nociceptive hypersensitivity, which are manifest via projections to the prelimbic cortex, resulting in layer 5-mediated antinociception. Our data unravel the importance of the NBM in top-down control of neocortical processing of pain-like behavior.","The basal nucleus of Meynert (NBM) plays a role in cognition by modulating cortical circuits. Here, the authors demonstrate plasticity of the NBM upon tissue injury, and that activating NBM cholinergic-GABAergic projections to the prefrontal cortex alleviates chronic pain-like behaviour in mice.",2022-08-25
542,Single-cell analysis of hepatoblastoma identifies tumor signatures that predict chemotherapy susceptibility using patient-specific tumor spheroids,"Pediatric hepatoblastoma is the most common primary liver cancer in infants and children. Studies of hepatoblastoma that focus exclusively on tumor cells demonstrate sparse somatic mutations and a common cell of origin, the hepatoblast, across patients. In contrast to the homogeneity these studies would suggest, hepatoblastoma tumors have a high degree of heterogeneity that can portend poor prognosis. In this study, we use single-cell transcriptomic techniques to analyze resected human pediatric hepatoblastoma specimens, and identify five hepatoblastoma tumor signatures that may account for the tumor heterogeneity observed in this disease. Notably, patient-derived hepatoblastoma spheroid cultures predict differential responses to treatment based on the transcriptomic signature of each tumor, suggesting a path forward for precision oncology for these tumors. In this work, we define hepatoblastoma tumor heterogeneity with single-cell resolution and demonstrate that patient-derived spheroids can be used to evaluate responses to chemotherapy.","The mechanisms of tumor heterogeneity in pediatric hepatoblastoma remain poorly characterized. Here, the authors perform single cell RNA sequencing and identify 5 signatures with distinct responses to chemotherapy using patient-derived hepatoblastoma spheroid cultures.",2022-08-25
543,Current Siberian heating is unprecedented during the past seven millennia,"The Arctic is warming faster than any other region on Earth. Putting this rapid warming into perspective is challenging because instrumental records are often short or incomplete in polar regions and precisely-dated temperature proxies with high temporal resolution are largely lacking. Here, we provide this long-term perspective by reconstructing past summer temperature variability at Yamal Peninsula – a hotspot of recent warming – over the past 7638 years using annually resolved tree-ring records. We demonstrate that the recent anthropogenic warming interrupted a multi-millennial cooling trend. We find the industrial-era warming to be unprecedented in rate and to have elevated the summer temperature to levels above those reconstructed for the past seven millennia (in both 30-year mean and the frequency of extreme summers). This is undoubtedly of concern for the natural and human systems that are being impacted by climatic changes that lie outside the envelope of natural climatic variations for this region.","A 7,638 yr summer temperature reconstruction based on subfossil trees buried in the Siberian Arctic shows that recent warming is unprecedented and interrupted a multi-millennial cooling trend.",2022-08-25
544,Cellular taxonomy of Hic1+ mesenchymal progenitor derivatives in the limb: from embryo to adult,"Tissue development and regeneration rely on the cooperation of multiple mesenchymal progenitor (MP) subpopulations. We recently identified Hic1 as a marker of quiescent MPs in multiple adult tissues. Here, we describe the embryonic origin of appendicular Hic1+ MPs and demonstrate that they arise in the hypaxial somite, and migrate into the developing limb at embryonic day 11.5, well after limb bud initiation. Time-resolved single-cell-omics analyses coupled with lineage tracing reveal that Hic1+ cells generate a unique MP hierarchy, that includes both recently identified adult universal fibroblast populations (Dpt+, Pi16+ and Dpt+ Col15a1+) and more specialised mesenchymal derivatives such as, peri and endoneurial cells, pericytes, bone marrow stromal cells, myotenocytes, tenocytes, fascia-resident fibroblasts, with limited contributions to chondrocytes and osteocytes within the skeletal elements. MPs endure within these compartments, continue to express Hic1 and represent a critical reservoir to support post-natal growth and regeneration.","Mesenchymal progenitors (MPs) are fundamental to tissue development and regeneration, however, their embryonic origin is unclear.

545,Discrete subicular circuits control generalization of hippocampal seizures,"Epilepsy is considered a circuit-level dysfunction associated with imbalanced excitation-inhibition, it is therapeutically necessary to identify key brain regions and related circuits in epilepsy. The subiculum is an essential participant in epileptic seizures, but the circuit mechanism underlying its role remains largely elusive. Here we deconstruct the diversity of subicular circuits in a mouse model of epilepsy. We find that excitatory subicular pyramidal neurons heterogeneously control the generalization of hippocampal seizures by projecting to different downstream regions. Notably, anterior thalamus-projecting subicular neurons bidirectionally mediate seizures, while entorhinal cortex-projecting subicular neurons act oppositely in seizure modulation. These two subpopulations are structurally and functionally dissociable. An intrinsically enhanced hyperpolarization-activated current and robust bursting intensity in anterior thalamus-projecting neurons facilitate synaptic transmission, thus contributing to the generalization of hippocampal seizures. These results demonstrate that subicular circuits have diverse roles in epilepsy, suggesting the necessity to precisely target specific subicular circuits for effective treatment of epilepsy.",The subiculum is known to contribute to seizures in epilepsy. Here the authors investigate the circuit mechanism by which the subiculum contributes to initiation and propagation of hippocampal seizures in a mouse model.,2022-08-25
546,Oligodendrocyte differentiation alters tRNA modifications and codon optimality-mediated mRNA decay,"Oligodendrocytes are specialized cells that confer neuronal myelination in the central nervous system. Leukodystrophies associated with oligodendrocyte deficits and hypomyelination are known to result when a number of tRNA metabolism genes are mutated. Thus, for unknown reasons, oligodendrocytes may be hypersensitive to perturbations in tRNA biology. In this study, we survey the tRNA transcriptome in the murine oligodendrocyte cell lineage and find that specific tRNAs are hypomodified in oligodendrocytes within or near the anticodon compared to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). This hypomodified state may be the result of differential expression of key modification enzymes during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Moreover, we observe a concomitant relationship between tRNA hypomodification and tRNA decoding potential; observing oligodendrocyte specific alterations in codon optimality-mediated mRNA decay and ribosome transit. Our results reveal that oligodendrocytes naturally maintain a delicate, hypersensitized tRNA/mRNA axis. We suggest this axis is a potential mediator of pathology in leukodystrophies and white matter disease when further insult to tRNA metabolism is introduced.","Mutations in tRNA processing factors can lead to myelin disorders. This study shows that differentiated oligodendrocytes, cells that make the myelin, are characterized by different tRNA modifications and mRNA decay compared to their precursor cells.",2022-08-25

Here, we show that cytochrome P450s (CYPs) from the CYP71BE subfamily catalyze an unprecedented 18(4→3) methyl shift required for biosynthesis of the abeo-abietane core structure present in diterpenoid triepoxides and in several other plant diterpenoids. In combination with two CYPs of the CYP82D subfamily, four CYPs from T. wilfordii are shown to constitute the minimal set of biosynthetic genes that enables triptonide biosynthesis using Nicotiana benthamiana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as heterologous hosts. In addition, co-expression of a specific T. wilfordii cytochrome b5 (Twcytb5-A) increases triptonide output more than 9-fold in S. cerevisiae and affords isolation and structure elucidation by NMR spectroscopic analyses of 18 diterpenoids, providing insights into the biosynthesis of diterpenoid triepoxides. Our findings pave the way for diterpenoid triepoxide production via fermentation.","How triptonide is made in the medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii is largely unknown.

548,Control cell migration by engineering integrin ligand assembly,"Advances in mechanistic understanding of integrin-mediated adhesion highlight the importance of precise control of ligand presentation in directing cell migration. Top-down nanopatterning limited the spatial presentation to sub-micron placing restrictions on both fundamental study and biomedical applications. To break the constraint, here we propose a bottom-up nanofabrication strategy to enhance the spatial resolution to the molecular level using simple formulation that is applicable as treatment agent. Via self-assembly and co-assembly, precise control of ligand presentation is succeeded by varying the proportions of assembling ligand and nonfunctional peptide. Assembled nanofilaments fulfill multi-functions exerting enhancement to suppression effect on cell migration with tunable amplitudes. Self-assembled nanofilaments possessing by far the highest ligand density prevent integrin/actin disassembly at cell rear, which expands the perspective of ligand-density-dependent-modulation, revealing valuable inputs to therapeutic innovations in tumor metastasis.","Engineering peptide assembly that controls integrin ligand presentation on the molecular level possesses by far the highest ligand density, expanding the perspective of ligand-density-dependent modulation.",2022-08-25

Here we develop a method for near leak-free, inducible expression of a polycistronic array containing up to 24 gRNAs from two orthogonal CRISPR/Cas systems to increase CRISPRai multiplexing capacity and target gene flexibility. To achieve strong inducibility, we create a technology to silence gRNA expression within the array in the absence of the inducer, since we found that long gRNA arrays for CRISPRai can express themselves even without promoter. Using this method, we create a highly tuned and easy-to-use CRISPRai toolkit in the industrially relevant yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, establishing the first system to combine simultaneous activation and repression, large multiplexing capacity, and inducibility. We demonstrate this toolkit by targeting 11 genes in central metabolism in a single transformation, achieving a 45-fold increase in succinic acid, which could be precisely controlled in an inducible manner. Our method offers a highly effective way to regulate genes and rewire metabolism in yeast, with principles of gRNA array construction and inducibility that should extend to other chassis organisms.","CRISPR gene activation and inhibition has become a powerful synthetic tool for influencing the expression of native genes for foundational studies, cellular reprograming, and metabolic engineering.

550,Self-cycled photo-Fenton-like system based on an artificial leaf with a solar-to-H2O2 conversion efficiency of 1.46%,"Millions of families around the world remain vulnerable to water scarcity and have no access to drinking water. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are an effective way towards water purification with qualified reactive oxygen species (ROSs) while are impeded by the high-cost and tedious process in either input of consumable reagent, production of ROSs, and the pre-treatment of supporting electrolyte. Herein, we couple solar light-assisted H2O2 production from water and photo-Fenton-like reactions into a self-cyclable system by using an artificial leaf, achieving an unassisted H2O2 production rate of 0.77 μmol/(min·cm2) under 1 Sun AM 1.5 illumination. Furthermore, a large (70 cm2) artificial leaf was used for an unassisted solar-driven bicarbonate-activated hydrogen peroxide (BAP) system with recycled catalysts for real-time wastewater purification with requirements for only water, oxygen and sunlight. This demonstration highlights the feasibility and scalability of photoelectrochemical technology for decentralized environmental governance applications from laboratory benchtops to industry.","Continuous generation of reactive oxygen species is desirable in the advanced oxidation process.

551,Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity determines estrogen receptor positive breast cancer dormancy and epithelial reconversion drives recurrence,"More than 70% of human breast cancers (BCs) are estrogen receptor α-positive (ER+). A clinical challenge of ER+ BC is that they can recur decades after initial treatments. Mechanisms governing latent disease remain elusive due to lack of adequate in vivo models. We compare intraductal xenografts of ER+ and triple-negative (TN) BC cells and demonstrate that disseminated TNBC cells proliferate similarly as TNBC cells at the primary site whereas disseminated ER+ BC cells proliferate slower, they decrease CDH1 and increase ZEB1,2 expressions, and exhibit characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) and dormancy. Forced E-cadherin expression overcomes ER+ BC dormancy. Cytokine signalings are enriched in more active versus inactive disseminated tumour cells, suggesting microenvironmental triggers for awakening. We conclude that intraductal xenografts model ER + BC dormancy and reveal that EMP is essential for the generation of a dormant cell state and that targeting exit from EMP has therapeutic potential.",The study of tumour dormancy is limited by suitable in vivo models. Here the authors show that mammary intraductal breast cancer (BC) xenografts model estrogen receptor α-positive (ER+) BC dormancy and rapid metastatic progression characteristic of triple-negative (TN) BC. The dormant disseminated ER+ BC cells display characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity and forced expression of E-cadherin allows them to overcome dormancy.,2022-08-25
552,Selective suppression of melanoma lacking IFN-γ pathway by JAK inhibition depends on T cells and host TNF signaling,"Therapeutic resistance to immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) in melanoma patients is a pressing issue, of which tumor loss of IFN-γ signaling genes is a major underlying mechanism. However, strategies of overcoming this resistance mechanism have been largely elusive. Moreover, given the indispensable role of tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) in ICBs, little is known about how tumor-intrinsic loss of IFN-γ signaling (IFNγR1KO) impacts TILs. Here, we report that IFNγR1KO melanomas have reduced infiltration and function of TILs. IFNγR1KO melanomas harbor a network of constitutively active protein tyrosine kinases centered on activated JAK1/2. Mechanistically, JAK1/2 activation is mediated by augmented mTOR. Importantly, JAK1/2 inhibition with Ruxolitinib selectively suppresses the growth of IFNγR1KO but not scrambled control melanomas, depending on T cells and host TNF. Together, our results reveal an important role of tumor-intrinsic IFN-γ signaling in shaping TILs and manifest a targeted therapy to bypass ICB resistance of melanomas defective of IFN-γ signaling.",Tumor loss of IFN-γ signalling is a major mechanism of resistance to immune checkpoint blockers. Here the authors report that melanoma cells with knockout of IFNγR1 show constitutive JAK1/2 activation and that the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib can overcome resistance to anti-CTLA-4 therapy.,2022-08-25
553,Specificity of TGF-β1 signal designated by LRRC33 and integrin αVβ8,"Myeloid lineage cells present the latent form of transforming growth factor-β1 (L-TGF-β1) to the membrane using an anchor protein LRRC33. Integrin αVβ8 activates extracellular L-TGF-β1 to trigger the downstream signaling functions. However, the mechanism designating the specificity of TGF-β1 presentation and activation remains incompletely understood. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of human L-TGF-β1/LRRC33 and integrin αVβ8/L-TGF-β1 complexes. Combined with biochemical and cell-based analyses, we demonstrate that LRRC33 only presents L-TGF-β1 but not the -β2 or -β3 isoforms due to difference of key residues on the growth factor domains. Moreover, we reveal a 2:2 binding mode of integrin αVβ8 and L-TGF-β1, which shows higher avidity and more efficient L-TGF-β1 activation than previously reported 1:2 binding mode. We also uncover that the disulfide-linked loop of the integrin subunit β8 determines its exquisite affinity to L-TGF-β1. Together, our findings provide important insights into the specificity of TGF-β1 signaling achieved by LRRC33 and integrin αVβ8.","Microenvironment localization and activation of L-TGF-β1 determine its specific function. Here, the authors elucidated the underlying mechanisms of specific presentation of L-TGF-β1 on the surface of myeloid lineage cells designated by LRRC33, and its activation by integrin αVβ8.",2022-08-25
554,CK2-induced cooperation of HHEX with the YAP-TEAD4 complex promotes colorectal tumorigenesis,"Dysregulation of Hippo pathway leads to hyperactivation of YAP-TEAD transcriptional complex in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we observed that HHEX (Hematopoietically expressed homeobox) may enhance transcription activity of the YAP-TEAD complex. HHEX associates with and stabilizes the YAP-TEAD complex on the regulatory genomic loci to coregulate the expression of a group of YAP/TEAD target genes. Also, HHEX may indirectly regulate these target genes by controlling YAP/TAZ expression. Importantly, HHEX is required for the pro-tumorigenic effects of YAP during CRC progression. In response to serum stimulation, CK2 (Casein Kinase 2) phosphorylates HHEX and enhances its interaction with TEAD4. A CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 diminishes the interaction between HHEX and TEAD4, leading to decreased expression of YAP/TEAD target genes. CX-4945 synergizes the antitumor activity of YAP-TEAD inhibitors verteporfin and Super-TDU. Elevated expression of HHEX is correlated with hyperactivation of YAP/TEAD and associated with poor prognosis of CRC patients. Overall, our study identifies HHEX as a positive modulator of YAP/TEAD to promote colorectal tumorigenesis, providing a new therapeutic strategy for targeting YAP/TEAD in CRC.",Hippo signalling is often deregulated in cancers. Here the authors show that CK2 enhances the cooperation of HHEX with YAP-TEAD complex to promote colorectal tumorigenesis.,2022-08-25
555,Electrocatalytic synthesis of adipic acid coupled with H2 production enhanced by a ligand modification strategy,"Adipic acid is an important building block of polymers, and is commercially produced by thermo-catalytic oxidation of ketone-alcohol oil (a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone). However, this process heavily relies on the use of corrosive nitric acid while releases nitrous oxide as a potent greenhouse gas. Herein, we report an electrocatalytic strategy for the oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid coupled with H2 production over a nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) catalyst modified with sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS). The intercalated SDS facilitates the enrichment of immiscible cyclohexanone in aqueous medium, thus achieving 3.6-fold greater productivity of adipic acid and higher faradaic efficiency (FE) compared with pure Ni(OH)2 (93% versus 56%). This strategy is demonstrated effective for a variety of immiscible aldehydes and ketones in aqueous solution. Furthermore, we design a realistic two-electrode flow electrolyzer for electrooxidation of cyclohexanone coupling with H2 production, attaining adipic acid productivity of 4.7 mmol coupled with H2 productivity of 8.0 L at 0.8 A (corresponding to 30 mA cm−2) in 24 h.","Adipic acid is an important building block of polymers, although its production relies on harmful reagents.

556,Destabilisation of the Subpolar North Atlantic prior to the Little Ice Age,"The cooling transition into the Little Ice Age was the last notable shift in the climate system prior to anthropogenic global warming. It is hypothesised that sea-ice to ocean feedbacks sustained an initial cooling into the Little Ice Age by weakening the subpolar gyre circulation; a system that has been proposed to exhibit bistability. Empirical evidence for bistability within this transition has however been lacking. Using statistical indicators of resilience in three annually-resolved bivalve proxy records from the North Icelandic shelf, we show that the subpolar North Atlantic climate system destabilised during two episodes prior to the Little Ice Age. This loss of resilience indicates reduced attraction to one stable state, and a system vulnerable to an abrupt transition. The two episodes preceded wider subpolar North Atlantic change, consistent with subpolar gyre destabilisation and the approach of a tipping point, potentially heralding the transition to Little Ice Age conditions.",Bivalves reveal that the subpolar North Atlantic destabilised and shows signs of having crossed a tipping point during the transition into the Little Ice Age.,2022-08-25
557,Convergence in phosphorus constraints to photosynthesis in forests around the world,"Tropical forests take up more carbon (C) from the atmosphere per annum by photosynthesis than any other type of vegetation. Phosphorus (P) limitations to C uptake are paramount for tropical and subtropical forests around the globe. Yet the generality of photosynthesis-P relationships underlying these limitations are in question, and hence are not represented well in terrestrial biosphere models. Here we demonstrate the dependence of photosynthesis and underlying processes on both leaf N and P concentrations. The regulation of photosynthetic capacity by P was similar across four continents. Implementing P constraints in the ORCHIDEE-CNP model, gross photosynthesis was reduced by 36% across the tropics and subtropics relative to traditional N constraints and unlimiting leaf P. Our results provide a quantitative relationship for the P dependence for photosynthesis for the front-end of global terrestrial C models that is consistent with canopy leaf measurements.","Phosphorus (P) limitation is pervasive in tropical forests. Here the authors analyse the dependence of photosynthesis on leaf N and P in tropical forests, and show that incorporating leaf P constraints in a terrestrial biosphere model enhances its predictive power.",2022-08-25
558,Catalytic innovation underlies independent recruitment of polyketide synthases in cocaine and hyoscyamine biosynthesis,"Tropane alkaloids such as hyoscyamine and cocaine are of importance in medicinal uses. Only recently has the hyoscyamine biosynthetic machinery become complete. However, the cocaine biosynthesis pathway remains only partially elucidated. Here we characterize polyketide synthases required for generating 3-oxo-glutaric acid from malonyl-CoA in cocaine biosynthetic route. Structural analysis shows that these two polyketide synthases adopt distinctly different active site architecture to catalyze the same reaction as pyrrolidine ketide synthase in hyoscyamine biosynthesis, revealing an unusual parallel/convergent evolution of biochemical function in homologous enzymes. Further phylogenetic analysis suggests lineage-specific acquisition of polyketide synthases required for tropane alkaloid biosynthesis in Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae species, respectively. Overall, our work elucidates not only a key unknown step in cocaine biosynthesis pathway but also, more importantly, structural and biochemical basis for independent recruitment of polyketide synthases in tropane alkaloid biosynthesis, thus broadening the understanding of conservation and innovation of biosynthetic catalysts.",Cocaine is a tropane alkaloid produced by Erythroxylum novogranatense. Here the authors identify two polyketide synthases involved in cocaine biosynthesis and provide insight into the parallel evolution of these enzymes in tropane alkaloids-producing plants.,2022-08-25
559,Consistent predator-prey biomass scaling in complex food webs,"The ratio of predator-to-prey biomass is a key element of trophic structure that is typically investigated from a food chain perspective, ignoring channels of energy transfer (e.g. omnivory) that may govern community structure. Here, we address this shortcoming by characterising the biomass structure of 141 freshwater, marine and terrestrial food webs, spanning a broad gradient in community biomass. We test whether sub-linear scaling between predator and prey biomass (a potential signal of density-dependent processes) emerges within ecosystem types and across levels of biological organisation. We find a consistent, sub-linear scaling pattern whereby predator biomass scales with the total biomass of their prey with a near ¾-power exponent within food webs - i.e. more prey biomass supports proportionally less predator biomass. Across food webs, a similar sub-linear scaling pattern emerges between total predator biomass and the combined biomass of all prey within a food web. These general patterns in trophic structure are compatible with a systematic form of density dependence that holds among complex feeding interactions across levels of organization, irrespective of ecosystem type.","The ratio of predator-to-prey biomass is a key element in food webs. Here, the authors report a unified analysis of predator-prey biomass scaling in complex food webs, finding general patterns of sub-linear scaling across ecosystems and levels of organization.",2022-08-25
560,Nanoscale segregation of channel and barrier claudins enables paracellular ion flux,"The paracellular passage of ions and small molecules across epithelia is controlled by tight junctions, complex meshworks of claudin polymers that form tight seals between neighboring cells. How the nanoscale architecture of tight junction meshworks enables paracellular passage of specific ions or small molecules without compromising barrier function is unknown. Here we combine super-resolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy in live and fixed cells and tissues, multivariate classification of super-resolution images and fluorescence resonance energy transfer to reveal the nanoscale organization of tight junctions formed by mammalian claudins. We show that only a subset of claudins can assemble into characteristic homotypic meshworks, whereas tight junctions formed by multiple claudins display nanoscale organization principles of intermixing, integration, induction, segregation, and exclusion of strand assemblies. Interestingly, channel-forming claudins are spatially segregated from barrier-forming claudins via determinants mainly encoded in their extracellular domains also known to harbor mutations leading to human diseases. Electrophysiological analysis of claudins in epithelial cells suggests that nanoscale segregation of distinct channel-forming claudins enables barrier function combined with specific paracellular ion flux across tight junctions.","Meshworks of claudin polymers control the paracellular transport and barrier properties of epithelial tight junctions. Here, the authors show different claudin nanoscale organization principles, finding that claudin segregation enables barrier formation and paracellular ion flux across tight junctions.",2022-08-25
561,Regulation of neuroendocrine plasticity by the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1,"Some small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) are highly sensitive to inhibitors of the histone demethylase LSD1. LSD1 inhibitors are thought to induce their anti-proliferative effects by blocking neuroendocrine differentiation, but the mechanisms by which LSD1 controls the SCLC neuroendocrine phenotype are not well understood. To identify genes required for LSD1 inhibitor sensitivity in SCLC, we performed a positive selection genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 loss of function screen and found that ZFP36L1, an mRNA-binding protein that destabilizes mRNAs, is required for LSD1 inhibitor sensitivity. LSD1 binds and represses ZFP36L1 and upon LSD1 inhibition, ZFP36L1 expression is restored, which is sufficient to block the SCLC neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype and induce a non-neuroendocrine “inflammatory” phenotype. Mechanistically, ZFP36L1 binds and destabilizes SOX2 and INSM1 mRNAs, two transcription factors that are required for SCLC neuroendocrine differentiation. This work identifies ZFP36L1 as an LSD1 target gene that controls the SCLC neuroendocrine phenotype and demonstrates that modulating mRNA stability of lineage transcription factors controls neuroendocrine to non-neuroendocrine plasticity.","LSD1 inhibition blocks the neuroendocrine phenotype of some small cell lung cancers (SCLCs).

562,Single residue modulators of amyloid formation in the N-terminal P1-region of α-synuclein,"Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is a protein involved in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease. Amyloid formation of αSyn can be modulated by the ‘P1 region’ (residues 36-42). Here, mutational studies of P1 reveal that Y39A and S42A extend the lag-phase of αSyn amyloid formation in vitro and rescue amyloid-associated cytotoxicity in C. elegans. Additionally, L38I αSyn forms amyloid fibrils more rapidly than WT, L38A has no effect, but L38M does not form amyloid fibrils in vitro and protects from proteotoxicity. Swapping the sequence of the two residues that differ in the P1 region of the paralogue γSyn to those of αSyn did not enhance fibril formation for γSyn. Peptide binding experiments using NMR showed that P1 synergises with residues in the NAC and C-terminal regions to initiate aggregation. The remarkable specificity of the interactions that control αSyn amyloid formation, identifies this region as a potential target for therapeutics, despite their weak and transient nature.","The authors of this work characterize the effect of amino acid substitution on α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregation. Residues 38 and 42 (in addition to 39) within the P1 region of α-Syn affect amyloid formation. The effect of substitution at position 38 is dependent on the amino-acid introduced, suggesting that specific interactions control α -Syn aggregation.",2022-08-25
563,A polymer electrolyte design enables ultralow-work-function electrode for high-performance optoelectronics,"Ambient solution-processed conductive materials with a sufficient low work function are essential to facilitate electron injection in electronic and optoelectronic devices but are challenging. Here, we design an electrically conducting and ambient-stable polymer electrolyte with an ultralow work function down to 2.2 eV, which arises from heavy n-doping of dissolved salts to polymer matrix. Such materials can be solution processed into uniform and smooth films on various conductors including graphene, conductive metal oxides, conducting polymers and metals to substantially improve their electron injection, enabling high-performance blue light-emitting diodes and transparent light-emitting diodes. This work provides a universal strategy to design a wide range of stable charge injection materials with tunable work function. As an example, we also synthesize a high-work-function polymer electrolyte material for high-performance solar cells.","Ambient-stable solution-processed conductive materials with a low work function are essential to facilitate electron injection.

564,Microengineered devices enable long-term imaging of the ventral nerve cord in behaving adult Drosophila,"The dynamics and connectivity of neural circuits continuously change on timescales ranging from milliseconds to an animal’s lifetime. Therefore, to understand biological networks, minimally invasive methods are required to repeatedly record them in behaving animals. Here we describe a suite of devices that enable long-term optical recordings of the adult Drosophila melanogaster ventral nerve cord (VNC). These consist of transparent, numbered windows to replace thoracic exoskeleton, compliant implants to displace internal organs, a precision arm to assist implantation, and a hinged stage to repeatedly tether flies. To validate and illustrate our toolkit we (i) show minimal impact on animal behavior and survival, (ii) follow the degradation of chordotonal organ mechanosensory nerve terminals over weeks after leg amputation, and (iii) uncover waves of neural activity caffeine ingestion. Thus, our long-term imaging toolkit opens up the investigation of premotor and motor circuit adaptations in response to injury, drug ingestion, aging, learning, and disease.","Minimally invasive procedures for tracking neural activity are important for understanding of neural networks. Here the authors describe microfabricated implants and windows that enable long-term recordings of motor circuit activity in Drosophila, allowing them to watch how neurons change their structure and activity over weeks.",2022-08-25
565,Strong and Localized Luminescence from Interface Bubbles Between Stacked hBN Multilayers,"Extraordinary optoelectronic properties of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures can be tuned via strain caused by mechanical deformation. Here, we demonstrate strong and localized luminescence in the ultraviolet region from interface bubbles between stacked multilayers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Compared to bubbles in stacked monolayers, bubbles formed by stacking vdW multilayers show distinct mechanical behavior. We use this behavior to elucidate radius- and thickness-dependent bubble geometry and the resulting strain across the bubble, from which we establish the thickness-dependent bending rigidity of hBN multilayers. We then utilize the polymeric material confined within the bubbles to modify the bubble geometry under electron beam irradiation, resulting in strong luminescence and formation of optical standing waves. Our results open a route to design and modulate microscopic-scale optical cavities via strain engineering in vdW materials, which we suggest will be relevant to both fundamental mechanical studies and optoelectronic applications.","Optoelectronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures can be tuned via strain.

Here we demonstrate cure of HT1 by direct, in vivo administration of a therapeutic lentiviral vector targeting the expression of a human fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) transgene in the porcine model of HT1. This therapy is well tolerated and provides stable long-term expression of FAH in pigs with HT1. Genomic integration displays a benign profile, with subsequent fibrosis and tumorigenicity gene expression patterns similar to wild-type animals as compared to NTBC-treated or diseased untreated animals. Indeed, the phenotypic and genomic data following in vivo lentiviral vector administration demonstrate comparative superiority over other therapies including ex vivo cell therapy and therefore support clinical application of this approach.","Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH).

567,Experimental demonstration of adversarial examples in learning topological phases,"Classification and identification of different phases and the transitions between them is a central task in condensed matter physics. Machine learning, which has achieved dramatic success in a wide range of applications, holds the promise to bring unprecedented perspectives for this challenging task. However, despite the exciting progress made along this direction, the reliability of machine-learning approaches in experimental settings demands further investigation. Here, with the nitrogen-vacancy center platform, we report a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of adversarial examples in learning topological phases. We show that the experimental noises are more likely to act as adversarial perturbations when a larger percentage of the input data are dropped or unavailable for the neural network-based classifiers. We experimentally implement adversarial examples which can deceive the phase classifier with a high confidence, while keeping the topological properties of the simulated Hopf insulators unchanged. Our results explicitly showcase the crucial vulnerability aspect of applying machine learning techniques in experiments to classify phases of matter, which can benefit future studies in this interdisciplinary field.","Machine learning has been applied to problems in condensed matter physics, but its performance in an experimental setting needs testing.

568,Elucidating the path to Plasmodium prolyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors that overcome halofuginone resistance,"The development of next-generation antimalarials that are efficacious against the human liver and asexual blood stages is recognized as one of the world’s most pressing public health challenges. In recent years, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including prolyl-tRNA synthetase, have emerged as attractive targets for malaria chemotherapy. We describe the development of a single-step biochemical assay for Plasmodium and human prolyl-tRNA synthetases that overcomes critical limitations of existing technologies and enables quantitative inhibitor profiling with high sensitivity and flexibility. Supported by this assay platform and co-crystal structures of representative inhibitor-target complexes, we develop a set of high-affinity prolyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors, including previously elusive aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase triple-site ligands that simultaneously engage all three substrate-binding pockets. Several compounds exhibit potent dual-stage activity against Plasmodium parasites and display good cellular host selectivity. Our data inform the inhibitor requirements to overcome existing resistance mechanisms and establish a path for rational development of prolyl-tRNA synthetase-targeted anti-malarial therapies.","The development of antimalarials against the human liver and asexual blood stages is one of the top public health challenges.

569,Social inequalities in climate change-attributed impacts of Hurricane Harvey,"Climate change is already increasing the severity of extreme weather events such as with rainfall during hurricanes. But little research to date investigates if, and to what extent, there are social inequalities in climate change-attributed extreme weather event impacts. Here, we use climate change attribution science paired with hydrological flood models to estimate climate change-attributed flood depths and damages during Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. Using detailed land-parcel and census tract socio-economic data, we then describe the socio-spatial characteristics associated with these climate change-induced impacts. We show that 30 to 50% of the flooded properties would not have flooded without climate change. Climate change-attributed impacts were particularly felt in Latina/x/o neighborhoods, and especially so in Latina/x/o neighborhoods that were low-income and among those located outside of FEMA’s 100-year floodplain. Our focus is thus on climate justice challenges that not only concern future climate change-induced risks, but are already affecting vulnerable populations disproportionately now.","New study shows that up to 50% of properties flooded after hurricane Harvey flooded because of climate change, with low-income and Latina/x/o neighborhoods experiencing higher climate change-attributed impacts.",2022-08-25
570,Catalytic ozone decomposition and adsorptive VOCs removal in bimetallic metal-organic frameworks,"Atmospheric ozone has long been a threat to human health, however, rational design of high-performance O3-decomposition catalysts remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate the great potential of a series of isomorphous bimetallic MOFs denoted as PCN-250(Fe2M) (M = Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) in catalytic O3 decomposition. Particularly, PCN-250(Fe2Co) showed 100% O3 removal efficiency for a continuous air flow containing 1 ppm O3 over a wide humidity range (0 ‒ 80% RH) at room temperature. Mechanism studies suggested that the high catalytic performance originated from the introduction of open Co(II) sites as well as its porous structure. Additionally, at low pressures around 10 Pa, PCN-250(Fe2Co) exhibited high adsorption capacities (89 ‒ 241 mg g−1) for most VOCs, which are not only a class of hazardous air pollutants but also the precursor of O3. This work opens up a new avenue to develop advanced air purification materials for O3 and VOCs removal in one.","Warm-season O3 pollution has been increasingly frequent worldwide in the past few years, exposing a threat to human health as well as the natural environment.

Here, we reconstruct hydrological conditions since the seventeenth century using testate amoeba data from 103 high-latitude peat archives. We show that 54% of the peatlands have been drying and 32% have been wetting over this period, illustrating the complex ecohydrological dynamics of high latitude peatlands and their highly uncertain responses to a warming climate.","A recent synthesis study found 54% of the high-latitude peatlands have been drying and 32% have been wetting over the past centuries, illustrating their complex ecohydrological dynamics and highly uncertain responses to a warming climate.",2022-08-24
572,Strong absorption and ultrafast localisation in NaBiS2 nanocrystals with slow charge-carrier recombination,"I-V-VI2 ternary chalcogenides are gaining attention as earth-abundant, nontoxic, and air-stable absorbers for photovoltaic applications. However, the semiconductors explored thus far have slowly-rising absorption onsets, and their charge-carrier transport is not well understood yet. Herein, we investigate cation-disordered NaBiS2 nanocrystals, which have a steep absorption onset, with absorption coefficients reaching >105 cm−1 just above its pseudo-direct bandgap of 1.4 eV. Surprisingly, we also observe an ultrafast (picosecond-time scale) photoconductivity decay and long-lived charge-carrier population persisting for over one microsecond in NaBiS2 nanocrystals. These unusual features arise because of the localised, non-bonding S p character of the upper valence band, which leads to a high density of electronic states at the band edges, ultrafast localisation of spatially-separated electrons and holes, as well as the slow decay of trapped holes. This work reveals the critical role of cation disorder in these systems on both absorption characteristics and charge-carrier kinetics.","Ternary chalcogenides are gaining interest as nontoxic, stable solar absorbers. Here, the authors investigate NaBiS2, finding cation disorder to be a critical parameter that enables its high absorption strength and unusual charge-carrier kinetics.",2022-08-24
573,Splicing QTL analysis focusing on coding sequences reveals mechanisms for disease susceptibility loci,"Splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) are one of the major causal mechanisms in genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci, but their role in disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. One reason is the complexity of alternative splicing events producing many unknown isoforms. Here, we propose two approaches, namely integration and selection, for this complexity by focusing on protein-structure of isoforms. First, we integrate isoforms with the same coding sequence (CDS) and identify 369-601 integrated-isoform ratio QTLs (i2-rQTLs), which altered protein-structure, in six immune subsets. Second, we select CDS incomplete isoforms annotated in GENCODE and identify 175-337 isoform-ratio QTL (i-rQTL). By comprehensive long-read capture RNA-sequencing among these incomplete isoforms, we reveal 29 full-length isoforms with unannotated CDSs associated with GWAS traits. Furthermore, we show that disease-causal sQTL genes can be identified by evaluating their trans-eQTL effects. Our approaches highlight the understudied role of protein-altering sQTLs and are broadly applicable to other tissues and diseases.","Splicing QTL (sQTL), genetic variants regulating alternative splicing, can be biologically important, but complex to detect and interpret.

574,Rational design of a sensitivity-enhanced tracer for discovering efficient APC–Asef inhibitors,"The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)–Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 4 (Asef) protein–protein interaction (PPI) is essential for colorectal cancer metastasis, making it a promising drug target. Herein, we obtain a sensitivity-enhanced tracer (tracer 7) with a high binding affinity (Kd = 0.078 μM) and wide signal dynamic range (span = 251 mp). By using tracer 7 in fluorescence-polarization assays for APC–Asef inhibitor screening, we discover a best-in-class inhibitor, MAI-516, with an IC50 of 0.041 ± 0.004 μM and a conjugated transcriptional transactivating sequence for generating cell-permeable MAIT-516. MAIT-516 inhibits CRC cell migration by specifically hindering the APC–Asef PPI. Furthermore, MAIT-516 exhibits no cytotoxic effects on normal intestinal epithelial cell and colorectal cancer cell growth. Overall, we develop a sensitivity-enhanced tracer for fluorescence polarization assays, which is used for the precise quantification of high-activity APC–Asef inhibitors, thereby providing insight into PPI drug development.","The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)–Asef protein interaction is essential for colorectal cancer metastasis.

575,Increased energy use for adaptation significantly impacts mitigation pathways,"Climate adaptation actions can be energy-intensive, but how adaptation feeds back into the energy system and the environment is absent in nearly all up-to-date energy scenarios. Here we quantify the impacts of adaptation actions entailing direct changes in final energy use on energy investments and costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution. We find that energy needs for adaptation increase considerably over time and with warming. The resulting addition in capacity for power generation leads to higher greenhouse gas emissions, local air pollutants, and energy system costs. In the short to medium term, much of the added capacity for power generation is fossil-fuel based. We show that mitigation pathways accounting for the adaptation-energy feedback would require a higher global carbon price, between 5% and 30% higher. Because of the benefits in terms of reduced adaptation needs, energy system costs in ambitious mitigation scenarios would be lower than previous estimates, and they would turn negative in well-below-2-degree scenarios, pointing at net gains in terms of power system costs.","A new study characterizes adaptation in mitigation pathways, and shows that climate adaptation can lead to higher energy demand, power system costs and carbon prices, with mitigation’s benefits compensating decarbonization costs.",2022-08-24
576,Investigating disparity in access to Australian clinical genetic health services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,"Globally, there is a recognised need that all populations should be able to access the benefits of genomics and precision medicine. However, achieving this remains constrained by a paucity of data that quantifies access to clinical genomics, particularly amongst Indigenous populations. Using administrative data from clinical genetic health services across three Australian jurisdictions (states/territories), we investigate disparities in the scheduling and attendance of appointments among Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people, compared to non-Indigenous people. For 14,870 appointments scheduled between 2014–2018, adjusted Multivariate Poisson Regression models revealed that Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people were scheduled fewer appointments (IRR 0.73 [0.68–0.80], <0.001) and attended at lower rates (IRR 0.85 [0.78–0.93], <0.001). Within this population, adults, females, remote residents, and those presenting in relation to cancer or prenatal indications experienced the greatest disparity in access. These results provide important baseline data related to disparities in access to clinical genomics in Australia.","Globally it is recognised that Indigenous populations should be able to access the benefits of genomics and precision medicine. Here, authors show that there are disparities in access to clinical genetic health services for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people in Australia.",2022-08-24
577,Mercury isotope evidence for Arctic summertime re-emission of mercury from the cryosphere,"During Arctic springtime, halogen radicals oxidize atmospheric elemental mercury (Hg0), which deposits to the cryosphere. This is followed by a summertime atmospheric Hg0 peak that is thought to result mostly from terrestrial Hg inputs to the Arctic Ocean, followed by photoreduction and emission to air. The large terrestrial Hg contribution to the Arctic Ocean and global atmosphere has raised concern over the potential release of permafrost Hg, via rivers and coastal erosion, with Arctic warming. Here we investigate Hg isotope variability of Arctic atmospheric, marine, and terrestrial Hg. We observe highly characteristic Hg isotope signatures during the summertime peak that reflect re-emission of Hg deposited to the cryosphere during spring. Air mass back trajectories support a cryospheric Hg emission source but no major terrestrial source. This implies that terrestrial Hg inputs to the Arctic Ocean remain in the marine ecosystem, without substantial loss to the global atmosphere, but with possible effects on food webs.","Arctic warming thaws permafrost, leading to enhanced soil mercury transport to the Arctic Ocean. Mercury isotope signatures in arctic rivers, ocean and atmosphere suggest that permafrost mercury is buried in marine sediment and not emitted to the global atmosphere",2022-08-24
578,Striatal dopamine dissociates methylphenidate effects on value-based versus surprise-based reversal learning,"Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate are widely used for their cognitive enhancing effects, but there is large variability in the direction and extent of these effects. We tested the hypothesis that methylphenidate enhances or impairs reward/punishment-based reversal learning depending on baseline striatal dopamine levels and corticostriatal gating of reward/punishment-related representations in stimulus-specific sensory cortex. Young healthy adults (N = 100) were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a reward/punishment reversal learning task, after intake of methylphenidate or the selective D2/3-receptor antagonist sulpiride. Striatal dopamine synthesis capacity was indexed with [18F]DOPA positron emission tomography. Methylphenidate improved and sulpiride decreased overall accuracy and response speed. Both drugs boosted reward versus punishment learning signals to a greater degree in participants with higher dopamine synthesis capacity. By contrast, striatal and stimulus-specific sensory surprise signals were boosted in participants with lower dopamine synthesis. These results unravel the mechanisms by which methylphenidate gates both attention and reward learning.","The mechanisms underpinning the variability in methylphenidate’s effects on cognition remain unclear. Here, the authors show that such effects reflect changes in striatal dopamine-related output gating of task-relevant cortical signals, and that these changes depend on baseline dopamine synthesis capacity.",2022-08-24
579,Human expansion into Asian highlands in the 21st Century and its effects,"Most intensive human activities occur in lowlands. However, sporadic reports indicate that human activities are expanding in some Asian highlands. Here we investigate the expansions of human activities in highlands and their effects over Asia from 2000 to 2020 by combining earth observation data and socioeconomic data. We find that ∼23% of human activity expansions occur in Asian highlands and ∼76% of these expansions in highlands comes from ecological lands, reaching 95% in Southeast Asia. The expansions of human activities in highlands intensify habitat fragmentation and result in large ecological costs in low and lower-middle income countries, and they also support Asian developments. We estimate that cultivated land net growth in the Asian highlands contributed approximately 54% in preventing the net loss of the total cultivated land. Moreover, the growth of highland artificial surfaces may provide living and working spaces for ∼40 million people. Our findings suggest that highland developments hold dual effects and provide new insight for regional sustainable developments.","Most of the intensive human activities usually occur in lowlands. Here the authors report that human activity expansions also were widely distributed in Asian highlands in the 21st century and held dual effects, which provides new insights for regional human activity expansions.",2022-08-24
580,Structural analysis of Red1 as a conserved scaffold of the RNA-targeting MTREC/PAXT complex,"To eliminate specific or aberrant transcripts, eukaryotes use nuclear RNA-targeting complexes that deliver them to the exosome for degradation. S. pombe MTREC, and its human counterpart PAXT, are key players in this mechanism but inner workings of these complexes are not understood in sufficient detail. Here, we present an NMR structure of an MTREC scaffold protein Red1 helix-turn-helix domain bound to the Iss10 N-terminus and show this interaction is required for proper cellular growth and meiotic mRNA degradation. We also report a crystal structure of a Red1-Ars2 complex explaining mutually exclusive interactions of hARS2 with various ED/EGEI/L motif-possessing RNA regulators, including hZFC3H1 of PAXT, hFLASH or hNCBP3. Finally, we show that both Red1 and hZFC3H1 homo-dimerize via their coiled-coil regions indicating that MTREC and PAXT likely function as dimers. Our results, combining structures of three Red1 interfaces with in vivo studies, provide mechanistic insights into conserved features of MTREC/PAXT architecture.","Unwanted RNA transcripts are targeted for degradation by nuclear complexes such as MTREC/PAXT.

581,Omicron SARS-CoV-2 mutations stabilize spike up-RBD conformation and lead to a non-RBM-binding monoclonal antibody escape,"Omicron SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly spreading worldwide. To delineate the impact of emerging mutations on spike’s properties, we performed systematic structural analyses on apo Omicron spike and its complexes with human ACE2 or S309 neutralizing antibody (NAb) by cryo-EM. The Omicron spike preferentially adopts the one-RBD-up conformation both before and after ACE2 binding, which is in sharp contrast to the orchestrated conformational changes to create more up-RBDs upon ACE2 binding as observed in the prototype and other four variants of concern (VOCs). Furthermore, we found that S371L, S373P and S375F substitutions enhance the stability of the one-RBD-up conformation to prevent exposing more up-RBDs triggered by ACE2 binding. The increased stability of the one-RBD-up conformation restricts the accessibility of S304 NAb, which targets a cryptic epitope in the closed conformation, thus facilitating the immune evasion by Omicron. These results expand our understanding of Omicron spike’s conformation, receptor binding and antibody evasion mechanism.","The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant spreads rapidly. Here the authors show that Omicron S preferentially adopts the one-RBD-up conformation, which leads to a non-RBM-binding monoclonal antibody escape. Mutagenesis reveals that S371L, S373P and S375F substitutions enhance the conformational stability.",2022-08-24
582,High density integration of stretchable inorganic thin film transistors with excellent performance and reliability,"Transistors with inorganic semiconductors have superior performance and reliability compared to organic transistors. However, they are unfavorable for building stretchable electronic products due to their brittle nature. Because of this drawback, they have mostly been placed on non-stretchable parts to avoid mechanical strain, burdening the deformable interconnects, which link these rigid parts, with the strain of the entire system. Integration density must therefore be sacrificed when stretchability is the first priority because the portion of stretchable wirings should be raised. In this study, we show high density integration of oxide thin film transistors having excellent performance and reliability by directly embedding the devices into stretchable serpentine strings to defeat such trade-off. The embedded transistors do not hide from deformation and endure strain up to 100% by themselves; thus, integration density can be enhanced without sacrificing the stretchability. We expect that our approach can create more compact stretchable electronics with high-end functionality than before.","Transistors with inorganic semiconductors have superior performance than organics. However, they are brittle and thus unfavorable for building deformable electronics. Here, authors directly embed such inorganic thin film transistors into serpentine strings to realize highly stretchable and miniaturized electronic circuits.",2022-08-24
583,Electron-mediated control of nanoporosity for targeted molecular separation in carbon membranes,"Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes are considered game-changers to overcome the challenges that conventional polymeric membranes face. However, CMS membranes also confront a challenge in successfully separating extremely similar-sized molecules. In this article, high-precision tuning of the microstructure of CMS membranes is proposed by controlled electron irradiation for the separation of molecules with size differences less than 0.05 nm. Fitting CMS membranes for targeted molecular separation can be accomplished by irradiation dosage control, resulting in highly-efficient C2H4/C2H6 separation for low dosages (∼250kGy, with selectivity ∼14) and ultra-selective H2/CO2 separation for high dosages (1000∼2000kGy with selectivity ∼80).The electron irradiated CMS also exhibits highly stabilized permeability and selectivity for long-term operation than the pristine CMS, which suffers from significant performance degradation due to physical aging. This study successfully demonstrates electron irradiation as a possible way to construct “designer” nanoporous carbon membranes out of the standard components mostly confined to pyrolysis conditions.",Controlled molecular separation by membranes requires 2D materials with precise structures to achieve the desired selectivity. Here authors demonstrate precise selectivity tuning in carbon membranes using electron irradiation.,2022-08-24
584,Flexible iontronics based on 2D nanofluidic material,"Iontronics focuses on the interactions between electrons and ions, playing essential roles in most processes across physics, chemistry and life science. Osmotic power source as an example of iontronics, could transform ion gradient into electrical energy, however, it generates low power, sensitive to humidity and can’t operate under freezing point. Herein, based on 2D nanofluidic graphene oxide material, we demonstrate an ultrathin (∼10 µm) osmotic power source with voltage of 1.5 V, volumetric specific energy density of 6 mWh cm−3 and power density of 28 mW cm−3, achieving the highest values so far. Coupled with triboelectric nanogenerator, it could form a self-charged conformable triboiontronic device. Furthermore, the 3D aerogel scales up areal power density up to 1.3 mW cm−2 purely from ion gradient based on nanoconfined enhancement from graphene oxide that can operate under −40 °C and overcome humidity limitations, enabling to power the future implantable electronics in human-machine interface.","Osmotic power source based on 2D nanofluidic graphene oxide could overcome humidity and temperature limitations due to high areal power density purely from ion gradient.

585,A Ziegler-type spherical cap model reveals early stage ethylene polymerization growth versus catalyst fragmentation relationships,"Polyolefin catalysts are characterized by their hierarchically complex nature, which complicates studies on the interplay between the catalyst and formed polymer phases. Here, the missing link in the morphology gap between planar model systems and industrially relevant spherical catalyst particles is introduced through the use of a spherical cap Ziegler-type catalyst model system for the polymerization of ethylene. More specifically, a moisture-stable LaOCl framework with enhanced imaging contrast has been designed to support the TiCl4 pre-active site, which could mimic the behaviour of the highly hygroscopic and industrially used MgCl2 framework. As a function of polymerization time, the fragmentation behaviour of the LaOCl framework changed from a mixture of the shrinking core (i.e., peeling off small polyethylene fragments at the surface) and continuous bisection (i.e., internal cleavage of the framework) into dominantly a continuous bisection model, which is linked to the evolution of the estimated polyethylene volume and the fraction of crystalline polyethylene formed. The combination of the spherical cap model system and the used advanced micro-spectroscopy toolbox, opens the route for high-throughput screening of catalyst functions with industrially relevant morphologies on the nano-scale.","Ziegler-type polyolefin catalysts have proven to be hard to characterize. Here the authors present a model system consisting of patterned LaOCl spherical caps, simulating bulk particles while facilitating the use of micro(-spectro)scopic characterization techniques specifically aimed at surfaces.",2022-08-24
586,A neural correlate of perceptual segmentation in macaque middle temporal cortical area,"High-resolution vision requires fine retinal sampling followed by integration to recover object properties. Importantly, accuracy is lost if local samples from different objects are intermixed. Thus, segmentation, grouping of image regions for separate processing, is crucial for perception. Previous work has used bi-stable plaid patterns, which can be perceived as either a single or multiple moving surfaces, to study this process. Here, we report a relationship between activity in a mid-level site in the primate visual pathways and segmentation judgments. Specifically, we find that direction selective middle temporal neurons are sensitive to texturing cues used to bias the perception of bi-stable plaids and exhibit a significant trial-by-trial correlation with subjective perception of a constant stimulus. This correlation is greater in units that signal global motion in patterns with multiple local orientations. Thus, we conclude the middle temporal area contains a signal for segmenting complex scenes into constituent objects and surfaces.","Perceptual segmentation, grouping distinct parts of the input for further processing, is a hard problem for sensory systems. Here, the authors report a link between spiking activity in primate visual cortical area MT and subjective segmentation.",2022-08-24
587,Genome-wide mutational signatures in low-coverage whole genome sequencing of cell-free DNA,"Mutational signatures accumulate in somatic cells as an admixture of endogenous and exogenous processes that occur during an individual’s lifetime. Since dividing cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments into the circulation, we hypothesize that plasma cfDNA might reflect mutational signatures. Point mutations in plasma whole genome sequencing (WGS) are challenging to identify through conventional mutation calling due to low sequencing coverage and low mutant allele fractions. In this proof of concept study of plasma WGS at 0.3–1.5x coverage from 215 patients and 227 healthy individuals, we show that both pathological and physiological mutational signatures may be identified in plasma. By applying machine learning to mutation profiles, patients with stage I-IV cancer can be distinguished from healthy individuals with an Area Under the Curve of 0.96. Interrogating mutational processes in plasma may enable earlier cancer detection, and might enable the assessment of cancer risk and etiology.","Detection of mutational signatures in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is challenging due to low sequence coverage and low mutant allele fractions. Here, the authors identify mutational signatures in plasma whole genome sequencing of cancer patients and use machine learning to distinguish them from healthy individuals.",2022-08-23
588,Covalent TCR-peptide-MHC interactions induce T cell activation and redirect T cell fate in the thymus,"Interactions between a T cell receptor (TCR) and a peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) ligand are typically mediated by noncovalent bonds. By studying T cells expressing natural or engineered TCRs, here we describe covalent TCR-pMHC interactions that involve a cysteine-cysteine disulfide bond between the TCR and the peptide. By introducing cysteines into a known TCR-pMHC combination, we demonstrate that disulfide bond formation does not require structural rearrangement of the TCR or the peptide. We further show these disulfide bonds still form even when the initial affinity of the TCR-pMHC interaction is low. Accordingly, TCR-peptide disulfide bonds facilitate T cell activation by pMHC ligands with a wide spectrum of affinities for the TCR. Physiologically, this mechanism induces strong Zap70-dependent TCR signaling, which triggers T cell deletion or agonist selection in the thymus cortex. Covalent TCR-pMHC interactions may thus underlie a physiological T cell activation mechanism that has applications in basic immunology and potentially in immunotherapy.","Differentiation and activation of T cells are normally modulated by non-covalent interactions between T cell receptor (TCR) and antigenic peptides. Here the authors use step-wise mutations, biochemical characterization and structural insights to describe the contributions of natural covalent bonds between TCR and antigenic peptides during these processes.",2022-08-23
589,Multifunctional nanoparticle potentiates the in situ vaccination effect of radiation therapy and enhances response to immune checkpoint blockade,"Radiation therapy (RT) activates an in situ vaccine effect when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), yet this effect may be limited because RT does not fully optimize tumor antigen presentation or fully overcome suppressive mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment. To overcome this, we develop a multifunctional nanoparticle composed of polylysine, iron oxide, and CpG (PIC) to increase tumor antigen presentation, increase the ratio of M1:M2 tumor-associated macrophages, and enhance stimulation of a type I interferon response in conjunction with RT. In syngeneic immunologically “cold” murine tumor models, the combination of RT, PIC, and ICB significantly improves tumor response and overall survival resulting in cure of many mice and consistent activation of tumor-specific immune memory. Combining RT with PIC to elicit a robust in situ vaccine effect presents a simple and readily translatable strategy to potentiate adaptive anti-tumor immunity and augment response to ICB or potentially other immunotherapies.","Radiotherapy can activate an in situ vaccine response and promote response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here the authors design a multifunctional nanoparticle to enhance tumor antigen presentation and modulate the tumor immune microenvironment following radiotherapy, showing improved anti-tumor immune responses in radiotherapy-treated tumors when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",2022-08-23
590,Nucleosome-directed replication origin licensing independent of a consensus DNA sequence,"The numerous enzymes and cofactors involved in eukaryotic DNA replication are conserved from yeast to human, and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.c.) has been a useful model organism for these studies. However, there is a gap in our knowledge of why replication origins in higher eukaryotes do not use a consensus DNA sequence as found in S.c. Using in vitro reconstitution and single-molecule visualization, we show here that S.c. origin recognition complex (ORC) stably binds nucleosomes and that ORC-nucleosome complexes have the intrinsic ability to load the replicative helicase MCM double hexamers onto adjacent nucleosome-free DNA regardless of sequence. Furthermore, we find that Xenopus laevis nucleosomes can substitute for yeast ones in engaging with ORC. Combined with re-analyses of genome-wide ORC binding data, our results lead us to propose that the yeast origin recognition machinery contains the cryptic capacity to bind nucleosomes near a nucleosome-free region and license origins, and that this nucleosome-directed origin licensing paradigm generalizes to all eukaryotes.","Most eukaryotes do not use a consensus DNA sequence as binding sites for the origin recognition complex (ORC) to initiate DNA replication, however budding yeast do. Here the authors show S. cerevisiae ORC can bind nucleosomes near nucleosome-free regions and recruit replicative helicases to form a pre-replication complex independent of the DNA sequence.",2022-08-23
591,Sub-10-fs observation of bound exciton formation in organic optoelectronic devices,"Fundamental mechanisms underlying exciton formation in organic semiconductors are complex and elusive as it occurs on ultrashort sub-100-fs timescales. Some fundamental aspects of this process, such as the evolution of exciton binding energy, have not been resolved in time experimentally. Here, we apply a combination of sub-10-fs Pump-Push-Photocurrent, Pump-Push-Photoluminescence, and Pump-Probe spectroscopies to polyfluorene devices to track the ultrafast formation of excitons. While Pump-Probe is sensitive to the total concentration of excited states, Pump-Push-Photocurrent and Pump-Push-Photoluminescence are sensitive to bound states only, providing access to exciton binding dynamics. We find that excitons created by near-absorption-edge photons are intrinsically bound states, or become such within 10 fs after excitation. Meanwhile, excitons with a modest >0.3 eV excess energy can dissociate spontaneously within 50 fs before acquiring bound character. These conclusions are supported by excited-state molecular dynamics simulations and a global kinetic model which quantitatively reproduce experimental data.",Ultrafast action spectroscopies of organic optoelectronic devices reveal that the formation of bound exciton state occurs as fast as 10 fs. Excitons having excess energy can dissociate spontaneously within 50-fs before acquiring bound character.,2022-08-23
592,Multiancestry exome sequencing reveals INHBE mutations associated with favorable fat distribution and protection from diabetes,"Body fat distribution is a major, heritable risk factor for cardiometabolic disease, independent of overall adiposity. Using exome-sequencing in 618,375 individuals (including 160,058 non-Europeans) from the UK, Sweden and Mexico, we identify 16 genes associated with fat distribution at exome-wide significance. We show 6-fold larger effect for fat-distribution associated rare coding variants compared with fine-mapped common alleles, enrichment for genes expressed in adipose tissue and causal genes for partial lipodystrophies, and evidence of sex-dimorphism. We describe an association with favorable fat distribution (p = 1.8 × 10−09), favorable metabolic profile and protection from type 2 diabetes (~28% lower odds; p = 0.004) for heterozygous protein-truncating mutations in INHBE, which encodes a circulating growth factor of the activin family, highly and specifically expressed in hepatocytes. Our results suggest that inhibin βE is a liver-expressed negative regulator of adipose storage whose blockade may be beneficial in fat distribution-associated metabolic disease.","Fat distribution is associated with cardiometabolic disease, although it has been less well studied than overall obesity. In a multiancestry exome-sequencing study, the authors identified predicted loss-of-function mutations in INHBE associated with favorable fat distribution and protection from type 2 diabetes.",2022-08-23
593,Delineating Mycobacterium abscessus population structure and transmission employing high-resolution core genome multilocus sequence typing,"Mycobacterium abscessus is an emerging multidrug-resistant non-tuberculous mycobacterium that causes a wide spectrum of infections and has caused several local outbreaks worldwide. To facilitate standardized prospective molecular surveillance, we established a novel core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) scheme. Whole genome sequencing data of 1991 isolates were employed to validate the scheme, re-analyze global population structure and set genetic distance thresholds for cluster detection and taxonomic identification. We confirmed and amended the nomenclature of the main dominant circulating clones and found that these also correlate well with traditional 7-loci MLST. Dominant circulating clones could be linked to a corresponding reference genome with less than 250 alleles while 99% of pairwise comparisons between epidemiologically linked isolates were below 25 alleles and 90% below 10 alleles. These thresholds can be used to guide further epidemiological investigations. Overall, the scheme will help to unravel the apparent global spread of certain clonal complexes and as yet undiscovered transmission routes.","Mycobacterium abscessus is an emerging infection of increasing public health concern due to outbreaks and intrinsic multidrug-resistance.

594,Americans experience a false social reality by underestimating popular climate policy support by nearly half,"Pluralistic ignorance—a shared misperception of how others think or behave—poses a challenge to collective action on problems like climate change. Using a representative sample of Americans (N = 6119), we examine whether Americans accurately perceive national concern about climate change and support for mitigating policies. We find a form of pluralistic ignorance that we describe as a false social reality: a near universal perception of public opinion that is the opposite of true public sentiment. Specifically, 80–90% of Americans underestimate the prevalence of support for major climate change mitigation policies and climate concern. While 66–80% Americans support these policies, Americans estimate the prevalence to only be between 37–43% on average. Thus, supporters of climate policies outnumber opponents two to one, while Americans falsely perceive nearly the opposite to be true. Further, Americans in every state and every assessed demographic underestimate support across all polices tested. Preliminary evidence suggests three sources of these misperceptions: (i) consistent with a false consensus effect, respondents who support these policies less (conservatives) underestimate support by a greater degree; controlling for one’s own personal politics, (ii) exposure to more conservative local norms and (iii) consuming conservative news correspond to greater misperceptions.","A new study finds that Americans underestimate how many are concerned about climate change as well as support for major climate policies by nearly half, with climate policy supporters significantly outnumbering non-supporters.",2022-08-23
595,Imaging and phase-locking of non-linear spin waves,"Non-linear processes are a key feature in the emerging field of spin-wave based information processing and allow to convert uniform spin-wave excitations into propagating modes at different frequencies. Recently, the existence of non-linear magnons at half-integer multiples of the driving frequency has been predicted for Ni80Fe20 at low bias fields. However, it is an open question under which conditions such non-linear spin waves emerge coherently and how they may be used in device structures. Usually non-linear processes are explored in the small modulation regime and result in the well known three and four magnon scattering processes. Here we demonstrate and image a class of spin waves oscillating at half-integer harmonics that have only recently been proposed for the strong modulation regime. The direct imaging of these parametrically generated magnons in Ni80Fe20 elements allows to visualize their wave vectors. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of two degenerate phase states that may be selected by external phase-locking. These results open new possibilities for applications such as spin-wave sources, amplifiers and phase-encoded information processing with magnons.","Many proposed spin-wave based devices make use of non-linear behaviour of spin-waves. Here, Dreyer et al show the emergence of non-linear spin waves oscillating at half-integer harmonics in the strong modulation regime. By applying super-Nyquist sampling Kerr microscopy they directly image these non-linear spin waves and demonstrate their phase-locking to an external frequency source.",2022-08-23
596,Nanoscale 3D spatial addressing and valence control of quantum dots using wireframe DNA origami,"Control over the copy number and nanoscale positioning of quantum dots (QDs) is critical to their application to functional nanomaterials design. However, the multiple non-specific binding sites intrinsic to the surface of QDs have prevented their fabrication into multi-QD assemblies with programmed spatial positions. To overcome this challenge, we developed a general synthetic framework to selectively attach spatially addressable QDs on 3D wireframe DNA origami scaffolds using interfacial control of the QD surface. Using optical spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation, we investigated the fabrication of monovalent QDs of different sizes using chimeric single-stranded DNA to control QD surface chemistry. By understanding the relationship between chimeric single-stranded DNA length and QD size, we integrated single QDs into wireframe DNA origami objects and visualized the resulting QD-DNA assemblies using electron microscopy. Using these advances, we demonstrated the ability to program arbitrary 3D spatial relationships between QDs and dyes on DNA origami objects by fabricating energy-transfer circuits and colloidal molecules. Our design and fabrication approach enables the geometric control and spatial addressing of QDs together with the integration of other materials including dyes to fabricate hybrid materials for functional nanoscale photonic devices.","Programming the 3D spatial organization of quantum dots requires precise control over their individual valence, but this is challenging due to the possible presence of multiple binding sites. Here, authors develop a general approach that uses highly programmable wireframe DNA origami structures to control the 3D spatial relationships between QDs and other non-nucleic-acid molecules.",2022-08-23
597,Rainfall and sea level drove the expansion of seasonally flooded habitats and associated bird populations across Amazonia,"Spatial arrangement of distinct Amazonian environments through time and its effect on specialized biota remain poorly known, fueling long-lasting debates about drivers of biotic diversification. We address the late Quaternary sediment deposition that assembled the world's largest seasonally flooded ecosystems. Genome sequencing was used to reconstruct the demographic history of bird species specialized in either early successional vegetation or mature floodplain forests. Sediment deposition that built seasonally flooded habitats accelerated throughout the Holocene (last 11,700 years) under sea level highstand and intensification of the South American Monsoon, at the same time as global increases in atmospheric methane concentration. Bird populations adapted to seasonally flooded habitats expanded due to enlargement of Amazonian river floodplains and archipelagos. Our findings suggest that the diversification of the biota specialized in seasonally flooded habitats is coupled to sedimentary budget changes of large rivers, which rely on combined effects of sea level and rainfall variations.","This study found that millennial periods of higher rainfall combined with rising sea level enhanced sediment accumulation in Amazonian rivers valleys. This fuelled synchronous expansion of vegetation adapted to seasonally flooded substrates and its specialized bird populations, showing how global climate changes can affect specific Amazonian species.",2022-08-23
598,scRNA-seq of gastric tumor shows complex intercellular interaction with an alternative T cell exhaustion trajectory,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) in gastric cancer (GC) has been shown to be important for tumor control but the specific characteristics for GC are not fully appreciated. We generated an atlas of 166,533 cells from 10 GC patients with matched paratumor tissues and blood. Our results show tumor-associated stromal cells (TASCs) have upregulated activity of Wnt signaling and angiogenesis, and are negatively correlated with survival. Tumor-associated macrophages and LAMP3+ DCs are involved in mediating T cell activity and form intercellular interaction hubs with TASCs. Clonotype and trajectory analysis demonstrates that Tc17 (IL-17+CD8+ T cells) originate from tissue-resident memory T cells and can subsequently differentiate into exhausted T cells, suggesting an alternative pathway for T cell exhaustion. Our results indicate that IL17+ cells may promote tumor progression through IL17, IL22, and IL26 signaling, highlighting the possibility of targeting IL17+ cells and associated signaling pathways as a therapeutic strategy to treat GC.",Gastric cancer can vary in tumour stage and immune cell involvement.

599,Arctic sea-ice loss is projected to lead to more frequent strong El Niño events,"Arctic sea ice has decreased substantially and is projected to reach a seasonally ice-free state in the coming decades. Little is known about whether dwindling Arctic sea ice is capable of influencing the occurrence of strong El Niño, a prominent mode of climate variability with global impacts. Based on time slice coupled model experiments, here we show that no significant change in the occurrence of strong El Niño is found in response to moderate Arctic sea-ice loss that is consistent with satellite observations to date. However, as the ice loss continues and the Arctic becomes seasonally ice-free, the frequency of strong El Niño events increases by more than one third, as defined by gradient-based indices that remove mean tropical Pacific warming induced by the seasonally ice-free Arctic. By comparing our time slice experiments with greenhouse warming experiments, we conclude that at least 37–48% of the increase of strong El Niño near the end of the 21st century is associated specifically with Arctic sea-ice loss. Further separation of Arctic sea-ice loss and greenhouse gas forcing only experiments implies that the seasonally ice-free Arctic might play a key role in driving significantly more frequent strong El Niño events.","With an ice-free Arctic, strong El Niño frequency increases 1/3 + . Almost half the increase by 2100 links to Arctic ice loss, not other greenhouse forcing. The Arctic’s influence on ENSO may represent a novel driver of changing climate extremes globally.",2022-08-23
600,Linear and nonlinear correlation estimators unveil undescribed taxa interactions in microbiome data,"It is well-known that human gut microbiota form an ecosystem where microbes interact with each other. Due to complex underlying interactions, some microbes may correlate nonlinearly. There are no measures in the microbiome literature we know of that quantify these nonlinear relationships. Here, we develop a methodology called Sparse Estimation of Correlations among Microbiomes (SECOM) for estimating linear and nonlinear relationships among microbes while maintaining the sparsity. SECOM accounts for both sample and taxon-specific biases in its model. Its statistical properties are evaluated analytically and by comprehensive simulation studies. We test SECOM in two real data sets, namely, forehead and palm microbiome data from college-age adults, and Norwegian infant gut microbiome data. Given that forehead and palm are related to skin, as desired, SECOM discovers each genus to be highly correlated between the two sites, but that is not the case with any of the competing methods. It is well-known that infant gut evolves as the child grows. Using SECOM, for the first time in the literature, we characterize temporal changes in correlations among bacterial families during a baby’s first year after birth.","Here, the authors present Sparse Estimation of Correlations among Microbiomes (SECOM), a tool devised to characterize both linear and nonlinear relationships in microbiome data. When applied to human skin and infant gut microbiome data, SECOM is able to retrieve taxa interactions undescribed by previous methods.",2022-08-23
601,Raptors avoid the confusion effect by targeting fixed points in dense aerial prey aggregations,"Collective behaviours are widely assumed to confuse predators, but empirical support for a confusion effect is often lacking, and its importance must depend on the predator’s targeting mechanism. Here we show that Swainson’s Hawks Buteo swainsoni and other raptors attacking swarming Mexican Free-tailed Bats Tadarida brasiliensis steer by turning towards a fixed point in space within the swarm, rather than by using closed-loop pursuit of any one individual. Any prey with which the predator is on a collision course will appear to remain on a constant bearing, so target selection emerges naturally from the geometry of a collision. Our results show how predators can simplify the demands on their sensory system by decoupling steering from target acquisition when capturing prey from a dense swarm. We anticipate that the same tactic will be used against flocks and schools across a wide range of taxa, in which case a confusion effect is paradoxically more likely to occur in attacks on sparse groups, for which steering and target acquisition cannot be decoupled.","Flocking, schooling, and swarming prey are thought to benefit from a confusion effect. However, here the authors show that hawks attacking swarming bats avoid confusion by steering towards a fixed point in the swarm instead of targeting any one individual.",2022-08-23
602,KLF4 recruits SWI/SNF to increase chromatin accessibility and reprogram the endothelial enhancer landscape under laminar shear stress,"Physiologic laminar shear stress (LSS) induces an endothelial gene expression profile that is vasculo-protective. In this report, we delineate how LSS mediates changes in the epigenetic landscape to promote this beneficial response. We show that under LSS, KLF4 interacts with the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex to increase accessibility at enhancer sites that promote the expression of homeostatic endothelial genes. By combining molecular and computational approaches we discover enhancers that loop to promoters of KLF4- and LSS-responsive genes that stabilize endothelial cells and suppress inflammation, such as BMPR2, SMAD5, and DUSP5. By linking enhancers to genes that they regulate under physiologic LSS, our work establishes a foundation for interpreting how non-coding DNA variants in these regions might disrupt protective gene expression to influence vascular disease.","Here the authors studied pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) under laminar shear stress and show that this physiologic condition markedly changes chromatin accessibility at regulatory regions, when compared to cells grown in a static state. They find that KLF4 organizes chromatin by interacting with the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex to regulate vasculo-protective gene expression.",2022-08-23
603,Duplicated ribosomal protein paralogs promote alternative translation and drug resistance,"Ribosomes are often seen as monolithic machines produced from uniformly regulated genes. However, in yeast most ribosomal proteins come from duplicated genes. Here, we demonstrate that gene duplication may serve as a stress-adaptation mechanism modulating the global proteome through the differential expression of ribosomal protein paralogs. Our data indicate that the yeast paralog pair of the ribosomal protein L7/uL30 produces two differentially acetylated proteins. Under normal conditions most ribosomes incorporate the hypo-acetylated major form favoring the translation of genes with short open reading frames. Exposure to drugs, on the other hand, increases the production of ribosomes carrying the hyper-acetylated minor paralog that increases translation of long open reading frames. Many of these paralog-dependent genes encode cell wall proteins that could promote tolerance to drugs as their translation increases after exposure to drugs. Together our data suggest a mechanism of translation control that functions through a differential use of near-identical ribosomal protein isoforms.",Most yeast ribosomal protein genes are duplicated but the functional significance of this duplication remains unclear. This study identifies a natural program where changing the ratio of proteins produced from duplicated genes modifies translation in response to drugs regardless of ribosome number.,2022-08-23
604,Estimating effects of parents’ cognitive and non-cognitive skills on offspring education using polygenic scores,"Understanding how parents’ cognitive and non-cognitive skills influence offspring education is essential for educational, family and economic policy. We use genetics (GWAS-by-subtraction) to assess a latent, broad non-cognitive skills dimension. To index parental effects controlling for genetic transmission, we estimate indirect parental genetic effects of polygenic scores on childhood and adulthood educational outcomes, using siblings (N = 47,459), adoptees (N = 6407), and parent-offspring trios (N = 2534) in three UK and Dutch cohorts. We find that parental cognitive and non-cognitive skills affect offspring education through their environment: on average across cohorts and designs, indirect genetic effects explain 36–40% of population polygenic score associations. However, indirect genetic effects are lower for achievement in the Dutch cohort, and for the adoption design. We identify potential causes of higher sibling- and trio-based estimates: prenatal indirect genetic effects, population stratification, and assortative mating. Our phenotype-agnostic, genetically sensitive approach has established overall environmental effects of parents’ skills, facilitating future mechanistic work.","Understanding how parents’ cognitive and non-cognitive skills influence their children’s educational trajectories is important for educational, family and economic policy. Here, the authors investigate parental influence on children’s education using genetic approaches.",2022-08-23
605,Spontaneous formation of a self-healing carbon nanoskin at the liquid–liquid interface,"Biological membranes exhibit the ability to self-repair and dynamically change their shape while remaining impermeable. Yet, these defining features are difficult to reconcile with mechanical robustness. Here, we report on the spontaneous formation of a carbon nanoskin at the oil–water interface that uniquely combines self-healing attributes with high stiffness. Upon the diffusion-controlled self-assembly of a reactive molecular surfactant at the interface, a solid elastic membrane forms within seconds and evolves into a continuous carbon monolayer with a thickness of a few nanometers. This nanoskin has a stiffness typical for a 2D carbon material with an elastic modulus in bending of more than 40–100 GPa; while brittle, it shows the ability to self-heal upon rupture, can be reversibly reshaped, and sustains complex shapes. We anticipate such an unusual 2D carbon nanomaterial to inspire novel approaches towards the formation of synthetic cells with rigid shells, additive manufacturing of composites, and compartmentalization in industrial catalysis.","Biological membranes exhibit the ability to self-repair and dynamically change their shape while remaining impermeable but these defining features are difficult to reconcile with mechanical robustness.

606,Integrated 3D printing of flexible electroluminescent devices and soft robots,"Flexible and stretchable light emitting devices are driving innovation in myriad applications, such as wearable and functional electronics, displays and soft robotics. However, the development of flexible electroluminescent devices via conventional techniques remains laborious and cost-prohibitive. Here, we report a facile and easily-accessible route for fabricating a class of flexible electroluminescent devices and soft robotics via direct ink writing-based 3D printing. 3D printable ion conducting, electroluminescent and insulating dielectric inks were developed, enabling facile and on-demand creation of flexible and stretchable electroluminescent devices with good fidelity. Robust interfacial adhesion with the multilayer electroluminescent devices endowed the 3D printed devices with attractive electroluminescent performance. Integrated our 3D printed electroluminescent devices with a soft quadrupedal robot and sensing units, an artificial camouflage that can instantly self-adapt to the environment by displaying matching color was fabricated, laying an efficient framework for the next generation soft camouflages.",Flexible electroluminescent devices are usually arduous to create.

607,Rhythmic transcription of Bmal1 stabilizes the circadian timekeeping system in mammals,"In mammals, the circadian clock consists of transcriptional and translational feedback loops through DNA cis-elements such as E-box and RRE. The E-box-mediated core feedback loop is interlocked with the RRE-mediated feedback loop, but biological significance of the RRE-mediated loop has been elusive. In this study, we established mutant cells and mice deficient for rhythmic transcription of Bmal1 gene by deleting its upstream RRE elements and hence disrupted the RRE-mediated feedback loop. We observed apparently normal circadian rhythms in the mutant cells and mice, but a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments revealed that the circadian period and amplitude of the mutants were more susceptible to disturbance of CRY1 protein rhythm. Our findings demonstrate that the RRE-mediated feedback regulation of Bmal1 underpins the E-box-mediated rhythm in cooperation with CRY1-dependent posttranslational regulation of BMAL1 protein, thereby conferring the perturbation-resistant oscillation and chronologically-organized output of the circadian clock.","The mammalian circadian clock is composed of clock genes forming transcriptional feedback loops. Here, the authors identify a key role of the secondary feedback loop that is interlocked with the core loop to establish a perturbation-resilient clock system.",2022-08-23
608,De novo protein design of photochemical reaction centers,"Natural photosynthetic protein complexes capture sunlight to power the energetic catalysis that supports life on Earth. Yet these natural protein structures carry an evolutionary legacy of complexity and fragility that encumbers protein reengineering efforts and obfuscates the underlying design rules for light-driven charge separation. De novo development of a simplified photosynthetic reaction center protein can clarify practical engineering principles needed to build new enzymes for efficient solar-to-fuel energy conversion. Here, we report the rational design, X-ray crystal structure, and electron transfer activity of a multi-cofactor protein that incorporates essential elements of photosynthetic reaction centers. This highly stable, modular artificial protein framework can be reconstituted in vitro with interchangeable redox centers for nanometer-scale photochemical charge separation. Transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrates Photosystem II-like tyrosine and metal cluster oxidation, and we measure charge separation lifetimes exceeding 100 ms, ideal for light-activated catalysis. This de novo-designed reaction center builds upon engineering guidelines established for charge separation in earlier synthetic photochemical triads and modified natural proteins, and it shows how synthetic biology may lead to a new generation of genetically encoded, light-powered catalysts for solar fuel production.","De novo development of a simplified photosynthetic reaction center protein can clarify practical engineering principles needed to build enzymes for efficient energy conversion.

609,Ultramicroporous material based parallel and extended paraffin nano-trap for benchmark olefin purification,"Selective paraffin capture from olefin/paraffin mixtures could afford high-purity olefins directly, but suffers from the issues of low separation selectivity and olefin productivity. Herein, we report an ultramicroporous material (PCP-IPA) with parallel-aligned linearly extending isophthalic acid units along the one-dimensional channel, realizing the efficient production of ultra-high purity C2H4 and C3H6 (99.99%). The periodically expanded and parallel-aligned aromatic-based units served as a paraffin nano-trap to contact with the exposed hydrogen atoms of both C2H6 and C3H8, as demonstrated by the simulation studies. PCP-IPA exhibits record separation selectivity of 2.48 and separation potential of 1.20 mol/L for C3H8/C3H6 (50/50) mixture, meanwhile the excellent C2H6/C2H4 mixture separation performance. Ultra-high purity C3H6 (99.99%) and C2H4 (99.99%) can be directly obtained through fixed-bed column from C3H8/C3H6 and C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, respectively. The record C3H6 productivity is up to 15.23 L/kg from the equimolar of C3H8/C3H6, which is 3.85 times of the previous benchmark material, demonstrating its great potential for those important industrial separations.","Selective paraffin capture to afford high-purity olefins directly is critical but still challenging. Herein, the authors discover a distinctive ultramicroporous material featuring closely packed and linearly-extended isophthalic acid units and thus serving as a paraffin nano-trap for the efficient production of ultra-high purity olefins from paraffins.",2022-08-22
610,Muconic acid production from glucose and xylose in Pseudomonas putida via evolution and metabolic engineering,"Muconic acid is a bioprivileged molecule that can be converted into direct replacement chemicals for incumbent petrochemicals and performance-advantaged bioproducts. In this study, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is engineered to convert glucose and xylose, the primary carbohydrates in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, to muconic acid using a model-guided strategy to maximize the theoretical yield. Using adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) and metabolic engineering in a strain engineered to express the D-xylose isomerase pathway, we demonstrate that mutations in the heterologous D-xylose:H+ symporter (XylE), increased expression of a major facilitator superfamily transporter (PP_2569), and overexpression of aroB encoding the native 3-dehydroquinate synthase, enable efficient muconic acid production from glucose and xylose simultaneously. Using the rationally engineered strain, we produce 33.7 g L−1 muconate at 0.18 g L−1 h−1 and a 46% molar yield (92% of the maximum theoretical yield). This engineering strategy is promising for the production of other shikimate pathway-derived compounds from lignocellulosic sugars.","Muconic acid is a platform chemical with wide industrial applicability. Here, the authors report efficient muconate production from glucose and xylose by engineered Pseudomonas putida strain using adaptive laboratory evolution, metabolic modeling, and rational strain engineering strategies.",2022-08-22
611,Epigenome-wide association study of human frontal cortex identifies differential methylation in Lewy body pathology,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are closely related progressive disorders with no available disease-modifying therapy, neuropathologically characterized by intraneuronal aggregates of misfolded α-synuclein. To explore the role of DNA methylation changes in PD and DLB pathogenesis, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of 322 postmortem frontal cortex samples and replicated results in an independent set of 200 donors. We report novel differentially methylated replicating loci associated with Braak Lewy body stage near TMCC2, SFMBT2, AKAP6 and PHYHIP. Differentially methylated probes were independent of known PD genetic risk alleles. Meta-analysis provided suggestive evidence for a differentially methylated locus within the chromosomal region affected by the PD-associated 22q11.2 deletion. Our findings elucidate novel disease pathways in PD and DLB and generate hypotheses for future molecular studies of Lewy body pathology.","Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are closely related neurodegenerative disorders, although the epigenetic similarities are not well known.

612,Whole Genome Association Study of the Plasma Metabolome Identifies Metabolites Linked to Cardiometabolic Disease in Black Individuals,"Integrating genetic information with metabolomics has provided new insights into genes affecting human metabolism. However, gene-metabolite integration has been primarily studied in individuals of European Ancestry, limiting the opportunity to leverage genomic diversity for discovery. In addition, these analyses have principally involved known metabolites, with the majority of the profiled peaks left unannotated. Here, we perform a whole genome association study of 2,291 metabolite peaks (known and unknown features) in 2,466 Black individuals from the Jackson Heart Study. We identify 519 locus-metabolite associations for 427 metabolite peaks and validate our findings in two multi-ethnic cohorts. A significant proportion of these associations are in ancestry specific alleles including findings in APOE, TTR and CD36. We leverage tandem mass spectrometry to annotate unknown metabolites, providing new insight into hereditary diseases including transthyretin amyloidosis and sickle cell disease. Our integrative omics approach leverages genomic diversity to provide novel insights into diverse cardiometabolic diseases.","Most studies of the genetics of the metabolome have been done in individuals of European descent.

613,Immunogenicity to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine third dose in people living with HIV,"In order to investigate safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine third dose in people living with HIV (PLWH), we analyze anti-RBD, microneutralization assay and IFN-γ production in 216 PLWH on ART with advanced disease (CD4 count <200 cell/mm3 and/or previous AIDS) receiving the third dose of a mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) after a median of 142 days from the second dose. Median age is 54 years, median CD4 nadir 45 cell/mm3 (20–122), 93% HIV-RNA < 50 c/mL. In 68% of PLWH at least one side-effect, generally mild, is recorded. Humoral response after the third dose was strong and higher than that achieved with the second dose (>2 log2 difference), especially when a heterologous combination with mRNA-1273 as third shot is used. In contrast, cell-mediated immunity remain stable. Our data support usefulness of third dose in PLWH currently receiving suppressive ART who presented with severe immune dysregulation.","HIV infection may affect the immune response to vaccination.

614,Global systematic review with meta-analysis reveals yield advantage of legume-based rotations and its drivers,"Diversified cropping systems, especially those including legumes, have been proposed to enhance food production with reduced inputs and environmental impacts. However, the impact of legume pre-crops on main crop yield and its drivers has never been systematically investigated in a global context. Here, we synthesize 11,768 yield observations from 462 field experiments comparing legume-based and non-legume cropping systems and show that legumes enhanced main crop yield by 20%. These yield advantages decline with increasing N fertilizer rates and crop diversity of the main cropping system. The yield benefits are consistent among main crops (e.g., rice, wheat, maize) and evident across pedo-climatic regions. Moreover, greater yield advantages (32% vs. 7%) are observed in low- vs. high-yielding environments, suggesting legumes increase crop production with low inputs (e.g., in Africa or organic agriculture). In conclusion, our study suggests that legume-based rotations offer a critical pathway for enhancing global crop production, especially when integrated into low-input and low-diversity agricultural systems.","Crop rotations including legumes have been proposed as a strategy to enhance food production. Here, the authors conduct a global meta-analysis on legume-based crop rotations, showing that legume pre-crops increase 20% of yield in average across various crops and climatic regions.",2022-08-22
615,A single WNT enhancer drives specification and regeneration of the Drosophila wing,"Wings have provided an evolutionary advantage to insects and have allowed them to diversify. Here, we have identified in Drosophila a highly robust regulatory mechanism that ensures the specification and growth of the wing not only during normal development but also under stress conditions. We present evidence that a single wing-specific enhancer in the wingless gene is used in two consecutive developmental stages to first drive wing specification and then contribute to mediating the remarkable regenerative capacity of the developing wing upon injury. We identify two evolutionary conserved cis-regulatory modules within this enhancer that are utilized in a redundant manner to mediate these two activities through the use of distinct molecular mechanisms. Whereas Hedgehog and EGFR signalling regulate Wingless expression in early primordia, thus inducing wing specification from body wall precursors, JNK activation in injured tissues induce Wingless expression to promote compensatory proliferation. These results point to evolutionarily linked conservation of wing specification and regeneration to ensure robust development of the wing, perhaps the most relevant evolutionary novelty in insects.",The wing is a remarkable evolutionary novelty in insects. Here the authors demonstrate that the specification and regenerative capacity of the wing relies on a single wing-specific enhancer of the wingless gene in Drosophila.,2022-08-22
616,Derivation and utility of schizophrenia polygenic risk associated multimodal MRI frontotemporal network,"Schizophrenia is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder characterized by widespread functional and structural brain abnormalities. However, previous association studies between MRI and polygenic risk were mostly ROI-based single modality analyses, rather than identifying brain-based multimodal predictive biomarkers. Based on schizophrenia polygenic risk scores (PRS) from healthy white people within the UK Biobank dataset (N = 22,459), we discovered a robust PRS-associated brain pattern with smaller gray matter volume and decreased functional activation in frontotemporal cortex, which distinguished schizophrenia from controls with >83% accuracy, and predicted cognition and symptoms across 4 independent schizophrenia cohorts. Further multi-disease comparisons demonstrated that these identified frontotemporal alterations were most severe in schizophrenia and schizo-affective patients, milder in bipolar disorder, and indistinguishable from controls in autism, depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. These findings indicate the potential of the identified PRS-associated multimodal frontotemporal network to serve as a trans-diagnostic gene intermediated brain biomarker specific to schizophrenia.","Schizophrenia is highly heritable and characterized by widespread brain abnormalities. Here, the authors identify schizophrenia polygenic risk associated multimodal frontotemporal network that can serve as a transdiagnostic brain signature specific to schizophrenia.",2022-08-22
617,Antiviral and clinical activity of bamlanivimab in a randomized trial of non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19,"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies are mainstay COVID-19 therapeutics. Safety, antiviral, and clinical efficacy of bamlanivimab were evaluated in the randomized controlled trial ACTIV-2/A5401. Non-hospitalized adults were randomized 1:1 within 10 days of COVID-19 symptoms to bamlanivimab or blinded-placebo in two dose-cohorts (7000 mg, n = 94; 700 mg, n = 223). No differences in bamlanivimab vs placebo were observed in the primary outcomes: proportion with undetectable nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA at days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 (risk ratio = 0.82–1.05 for 7000 mg [p(overall) = 0.88] and 0.81–1.21 for 700 mg [p(overall) = 0.49]), time to symptom improvement (median 21 vs 18.5 days [p = 0.97], 7000 mg; 24 vs 20.5 days [p = 0.08], 700 mg), or grade 3+ adverse events. However, bamlanivimab was associated with lower day 3 nasopharyngeal viral levels and faster reductions in inflammatory markers and viral decay by modeling. This study provides evidence of faster reductions in nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels but not shorter symptom durations in non-hospitalized adults with early variants of SARS-CoV-2.","In April 2021, Eli Lilly voluntarily asked the FDA to revoke the Emergency Use Authorization for the monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab due to reduced susceptibility in vitro to SARS-CoV-2 variants, not for safety. In this work, authors carry out a placebo-controlled phase 2 evaluation of bamlanivimab in non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19, to determine safety and efficacy.",2022-08-22
618,The whole blood transcriptional regulation landscape in 465 COVID-19 infected samples from Japan COVID-19 Task Force,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recently-emerged infectious disease that has caused millions of deaths, where comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms is still unestablished. In particular, studies of gene expression dynamics and regulation landscape in COVID-19 infected individuals are limited. Here, we report on a thorough analysis of whole blood RNA-seq data from 465 genotyped samples from the Japan COVID-19 Task Force, including 359 severe and 106 non-severe COVID-19 cases. We discover 1169 putative causal expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) including 34 possible colocalizations with biobank fine-mapping results of hematopoietic traits in a Japanese population, 1549 putative causal splice QTLs (sQTLs; e.g. two independent sQTLs at TOR1AIP1), as well as biologically interpretable trans-eQTL examples (e.g., REST and STING1), all fine-mapped at single variant resolution. We perform differential gene expression analysis to elucidate 198 genes with increased expression in severe COVID-19 cases and enriched for innate immune-related functions. Finally, we evaluate the limited but non-zero effect of COVID-19 phenotype on eQTL discovery, and highlight the presence of COVID-19 severity-interaction eQTLs (ieQTLs; e.g., CLEC4C and MYBL2). Our study provides a comprehensive catalog of whole blood regulatory variants in Japanese, as well as a reference for transcriptional landscapes in response to COVID-19 infection.","Genetic mechanisms influencing COVID-19 susceptibility are not well understood.

619,Atomic transistors based on seamless lateral metal-semiconductor junctions with a sub-1-nm transfer length,"The edge-to-edge connected metal-semiconductor junction (MSJ) for two-dimensional (2D) transistors has the potential to reduce the contact length while improving the performance of the devices. However, typical 2D materials are thermally and chemically unstable, which impedes the reproducible achievement of high-quality edge contacts. Here we present a scalable synthetic strategy to fabricate low-resistance edge contacts to atomic transistors using a thermally stable 2D metal, PtTe2. The use of PtTe2 as an epitaxial template enables the lateral growth of monolayer MoS2 to achieve a PtTe2-MoS2 MSJ with the thinnest possible, seamless atomic interface. The synthesized lateral heterojunction enables the reduced dimensions of Schottky barriers and enhanced carrier injection compared to counterparts composed of a vertical 3D metal contact. Furthermore, facile position-selected growth of PtTe2-MoS2 MSJ arrays using conventional lithography can facilitate the design of device layouts with high processability, while providing low contact resistivity and ultrashort transfer length on wafer scales.","Edge-to-edge metal-semiconductor junctions have the potential to improve the performance of 2D transistors.

620,Extending the low-temperature operation of sodium metal batteries combining linear and cyclic ether-based electrolyte solutions,"Nonaqueous sodium-based batteries are ideal candidates for the next generation of electrochemical energy storage devices. However, despite the promising performance at ambient temperature, their low-temperature (e.g., < 0 °C) operation is detrimentally affected by the increase in the electrolyte resistance and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) instability. Here, to circumvent these issues, we propose specific electrolyte formulations comprising linear and cyclic ether-based solvents and sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate salt that are thermally stable down to −150 °C and enable the formation of a stable SEI at low temperatures. When tested in the Na||Na coin cell configuration, the low-temperature electrolytes enable long-term cycling down to −80 °C. Via ex situ physicochemical (e.g., X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy) electrode measurements and density functional theory calculations, we investigate the mechanisms responsible for efficient low-temperature electrochemical performance. We also report the assembly and testing between −20 °C and −60 °C of full Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 coin cells. The cell tested at −40 °C shows an initial discharge capacity of 68 mAh g−1 with a capacity retention of approximately 94% after 100 cycles at 22 mA g−1.",The low-temperature operation of non-aqueous sodium-based batteries is affected by the properties of the electrolyte.

621,Lysosomal exocytosis releases pathogenic α-synuclein species from neurons in synucleinopathy models,"Considerable evidence supports the release of pathogenic aggregates of the neuronal protein α-Synuclein (αSyn) into the extracellular space. While this release is proposed to instigate the neuron-to-neuron transmission and spread of αSyn pathology in synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease, the molecular-cellular mechanism(s) remain unclear. To study this, we generated a new mouse model to specifically immunoisolate neuronal lysosomes, and established a long-term culture model where αSyn aggregates are produced within neurons without the addition of exogenous fibrils. We show that neuronally generated pathogenic species of αSyn accumulate within neuronal lysosomes in mouse brains and primary neurons. We then find that neurons release these pathogenic αSyn species via SNARE-dependent lysosomal exocytosis. The released aggregates are non-membrane enveloped and seeding-competent. Additionally, we find that this release is dependent on neuronal activity and cytosolic Ca2+. These results propose lysosomal exocytosis as a central mechanism for the release of aggregated and degradation-resistant proteins from neurons.","Release of α-synuclein aggregates by neurons instigates spread of pathology in synucleinopathies, but the mechanism remains unclear.

622,Ultra-strong spin–orbit coupling and topological moiré engineering in twisted ZrS2 bilayers,"We predict that twisted bilayers of 1T-ZrS2 realize a novel and tunable platform to engineer two-dimensional topological quantum phases dominated by strong spin-orbit interactions. At small twist angles, ZrS2 heterostructures give rise to an emergent and twist-controlled moiré Kagome lattice, combining geometric frustration and strong spin-orbit coupling to give rise to a moiré quantum spin Hall insulator with highly controllable and nearly-dispersionless bands. We devise a generic pseudo-spin theory for group-IV transition metal dichalcogenides that relies on the two-component character of the valence band maximum of the 1T structure at Γ, and study the emergence of a robust quantum anomalous Hall phase as well as possible fractional Chern insulating states from strong Coulomb repulsion at fractional fillings of the topological moiré Kagome bands. Our results establish group-IV transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers as a novel moiré platform to realize strongly-correlated topological phases in a twist-tunable setting.","Studies of twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides have so far focused only on those containing group-VI metals.

623,Human acute inflammatory recovery is defined by co-regulatory dynamics of white blood cell and platelet populations,"Inflammation is the physiologic reaction to cellular and tissue damage caused by trauma, ischemia, infection, and other pathologic conditions. Elevation of white blood cell count (WBC) and altered levels of other acute phase reactants are cardinal signs of inflammation, but the dynamics of these changes and their resolution are not well established. Here we studied inflammatory recovery from trauma, ischemia, and infection by tracking longitudinal dynamics of clinical laboratory measurements in hospitalized patients. We identified a universal recovery trajectory defined by exponential WBC decay and delayed linear growth of platelet count (PLT). Co-regulation of WBC-PLT dynamics is a fundamental mechanism of acute inflammatory recovery and provides a generic approach for identifying high-risk patients: 32x relative risk (RR) of adverse outcomes for cardiac surgery, 9x RR of death from COVID-19, 9x RR of death from sepsis, and 5x RR of death from myocardial infarction.","Inflammation is a protective response of the body.

624,"Double-Bilayer polar nanoregions and Mn antisites in (Ca, Sr)3Mn2O7","The layered perovskite Ca3Mn2O7 (CMO) is a hybrid improper ferroelectric candidate proposed for room temperature multiferroicity, which also displays negative thermal expansion behavior due to a competition between coexisting polar and nonpolar phases. However, little is known about the atomic-scale structure of the polar/nonpolar phase coexistence or the underlying physics of its formation and transition. In this work, we report the direct observation of double bilayer polar nanoregions (db-PNRs) in Ca2.9Sr0.1Mn2O7 using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM). In-situ TEM heating experiments show that the db-PNRs can exist up to 650 °C. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) studies coupled with first-principles calculations demonstrate that the stabilization mechanism of the db-PNRs is directly related to an Mn oxidation state change (from 4+ to 2+), which is linked to the presence of Mn antisite defects. These findings open the door to manipulating phase coexistence and achieving exotic properties in hybrid improper ferroelectric.","The competition between the polar and nonpolar phase in the prototypical hybrid improper ferroelectric crystal Ca3Mn2O7 leads to exotic properties.

625,Single cell transcriptomic analysis of the immune cell compartment in the human small intestine and in Celiac disease,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which ingestion of dietary gluten triggers an immune reaction in the small intestine leading to destruction of the lining epithelium. Current treatment focusses on lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells and cytotoxic intraepithelial CD8+ T cells have been proposed to be central in disease pathogenesis. Here we use unbiased single-cell RNA-sequencing and explore the heterogeneity of CD45+ immune cells in the human small intestine. We show altered myeloid cell transcriptomes present in active celiac lesions. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells transcriptomes show extensive changes and we define a natural intraepithelial lymphocyte population that is reduced in celiac disease. We show that the immune landscape in Celiac patients on a gluten-free diet is only partially restored compared to control samples. Altogether, we provide a single cell transcriptomic resource that can inform the immune landscape of the small intestine during Celiac disease.","Celiac disease is linked to responsiveness to dietary gluten, which manifests itself as immune cell activation and the immunopathology including destruction of the epithelium of the small intestine. Here the authors apply single cell transcriptomics to characterise the immune cell compartment of the human small intestine during active Celiac disease.",2022-08-22
626,Comparison of the 2021 COVID-19 roadmap projections against public health data in England,"Control and mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic in England has relied on a combination of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Some of these NPIs are extremely costly (economically and socially), so it was important to relax these promptly without overwhelming already burdened health services. The eventual policy was a Roadmap of four relaxation steps throughout 2021, taking England from lock-down to the cessation of all restrictions on social interaction. In a series of six Roadmap documents generated throughout 2021, models assessed the potential risk of each relaxation step. Here we show that the model projections generated a reliable estimation of medium-term hospital admission trends, with the data points up to September 2021 generally lying within our 95% prediction intervals. The greatest uncertainties in the modelled scenarios came from vaccine efficacy estimates against novel variants, and from assumptions about human behaviour in the face of changing restrictions and risk.","The ’Roadmap’ for relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in England in 2021 was informed by mathematical modelling. Here, the authors perform a retrospective assessment of the accuracy of modelling predictions and identify the main sources of uncertainty that led to observed values deviating from projections.",2022-08-22
627,Evolution of longitudinal division in multicellular bacteria of the Neisseriaceae family,"Rod-shaped bacteria typically elongate and divide by transverse fission. However, several bacterial species can form rod-shaped cells that divide longitudinally. Here, we study the evolution of cell shape and division mode within the family Neisseriaceae, which includes Gram-negative coccoid and rod-shaped species. In particular, bacteria of the genera Alysiella, Simonsiella and Conchiformibius, which can be found in the oral cavity of mammals, are multicellular and divide longitudinally. We use comparative genomics and ultrastructural microscopy to infer that longitudinal division within Neisseriaceae evolved from a rod-shaped ancestor. In multicellular longitudinally-dividing species, neighbouring cells within multicellular filaments are attached by their lateral peptidoglycan. In these bacteria, peptidoglycan insertion does not appear concentric, i.e. from the cell periphery to its centre, but as a medial sheet guillotining each cell. Finally, we identify genes and alleles associated with multicellularity and longitudinal division, including the acquisition of amidase-encoding gene amiC2, and amino acid changes in proteins including MreB and FtsA. Introduction of amiC2 and allelic substitution of mreB in a rod-shaped species that divides by transverse fission results in shorter cells with longer septa. Our work sheds light on the evolution of multicellularity and longitudinal division in bacteria, and suggests that members of the Neisseriaceae family may be good models to study these processes due to their morphological plasticity and genetic tractability.","Rod-shaped bacteria typically elongate and divide by transverse fission, but a few species are known to divide longitudinally. Here, the authors use genomic, phylogenetic and microscopy techniques to shed light on the evolution of cell shape, multicellularity and division mode within the family Neisseriaceae.",2022-08-22
628,Population-based tract-to-region connectome of the human brain and its hierarchical topology,"Connectome maps region-to-region connectivities but does not inform which white matter pathways form the connections. Here we constructed a population-based tract-to-region connectome to fill this information gap. The constructed connectome quantifies the population probability of a white matter tract innervating a cortical region. The results show that ~85% of the tract-to-region connectome entries are consistent across individuals, whereas the remaining (~15%) have substantial individual differences requiring individualized mapping. Further hierarchical clustering on cortical regions revealed dorsal, ventral, and limbic networks based on the tract-to-region connective patterns. The clustering results on white matter bundles revealed the categorization of fiber bundle systems in the association pathways. This tract-to-region connectome provides insights into the connective topology between cortical regions and white matter bundles. The derived hierarchical relation further offers a categorization of gray and white matter structures.","The brain connectome maps region-to-region connections but often ignores the role of the connecting pathways. Here, the authors mapped the tract-to-region relations to reveal the hierarchical relation of fiber bundles and dorsal, ventral, and limbic networks.",2022-08-22
629,Generalization in quantum machine learning from few training data,"Modern quantum machine learning (QML) methods involve variationally optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit on a training data set, and subsequently making predictions on a testing data set (i.e., generalizing). In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of generalization performance in QML after training on a limited number N of training data points. We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with T trainable gates scales at worst as \(\sqrt{T/N}\). When only K ≪ T gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to \(\sqrt{K/N}\). Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set. Other potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or quantum dynamical simulation. Our work injects new hope into the field of QML, as good generalization is guaranteed from few training data.","The power of quantum machine learning algorithms based on parametrised quantum circuits are still not fully understood. Here, the authors report rigorous bounds on the generalisation error in variational QML, confirming how known implementable models generalize well from an efficient amount of training data.",2022-08-22
630,Dynamically stable and amplified circularly polarized excimer emission regulated by solvation of chiral co-assembly process,"Chiral supramolecular assembly has been assigned to be one of the most favorable strategies for the development of excellent circularly polarized luminescent (CPL)-active materials. Herein, we report our study of an achiral boron-containing pyrene (Py)-based chromophore (PyBO) as a circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE) dye induced by chiral co-assemblies containing chiral binaphthyl-based enantiomers (R/S-M). Chiral co-assembly R/S-M-(PyBO)4 fresh film spin-coated from toluene solution can exhibit orderly nanofibers and strong green CPEE (λem = 512 nm, gem = ±0.45, ΦFL = 51.2 %) resulting from an achiral PyBO excimer. In contrast, only a very weak blue CPL was observed (λem = 461 nm, gem = ±  0.0125, ΦFL = 19.0 %) after 187 h due to PyBO monomer emission as spherulite growth. Interestingly, this kind of chiral co-assembly R-M-(PyBO)4-T film from tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution retains uniform morphology and affords the most stable and strongest CPEE performance (λem = 512 nm, gem = + 0.62, ΦFL = 53.3 %) after 10 days.","Chiral supramolecular assembly is an important strategy for the development of excellent circularly polarized luminescent (CPL)-active materials, but often they suffer from low quantum yield and luminescence dissymmetry factor.

631,Light-responsive self-strained organic semiconductor for large flexible OFET sensing array,"With the wide application of organic semiconductors (OSCs), researchers are now grappling with a new challenge: design and synthesize OSCs materials with specific functions to satisfy the requirements of high-performance semiconductor devices. Strain engineering is an effective method to improve the semiconductor material’s carrier mobility, which is fundamentally originated from the rearrangement of the atomic packing model of materials under mechanic stress. Here, we design and synthesize a new OSC material named AZO-BTBT-8 based on high-mobility benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene (BTBT) as the semiconductor backbone. Octane is employed to increase molecular flexibility and solubility, and azobenzene at the other end of the BTBT backbone provides photoisomerization properties and structural balance. Notably, the AZO-BTBT-8 photoisomerization leads to lattice strain in thin-film devices, where exceptional device performance enhancement is realized. On this basis, a large-scale flexible organic field-effect transistor (OFET) device array is fabricated and realizes high-resolution UV imaging with reversible light response.","Strain engineering is effective to improve the carrier mobility of semiconductor materials. Here, the authors demonstrate lattice strain-induced mobility enhancement of an azobenzene compound under photoisomerization and its application in large-scale flexible organic field-effect transistors.",2022-08-20
632,Inelastic phonon transport across atomically sharp metal/semiconductor interfaces,"Understanding thermal transport across metal/semiconductor interfaces is crucial for the heat dissipation of electronics. The dominant heat carriers in non-metals, phonons, are thought to transport elastically across most interfaces, except for a few extreme cases where the two materials that formed the interface are highly dissimilar with a large difference in Debye temperature. In this work, we show that even for two materials with similar Debye temperatures (Al/Si, Al/GaN), a substantial portion of phonons will transport inelastically across their interfaces at high temperatures, significantly enhancing interface thermal conductance. Moreover, we find that interface sharpness strongly affects phonon transport process. For atomically sharp interfaces, phonons are allowed to transport inelastically and interface thermal conductance linearly increases at high temperatures. With a diffuse interface, inelastic phonon transport diminishes. Our results provide new insights on phonon transport across interfaces and open up opportunities for engineering interface thermal conductance specifically for materials of relevance to microelectronics.","Phonons are thought to transport elastically across most interfaces. Here, the authors show that a substantial portion of phonons transport inelastically, adding another heat conduction channel and enhancing thermal conductance across interfaces.",2022-08-20
633,"A film-lever actuated switch technology for multifunctional, on-demand, and robust manipulation of liquids","A lab-on-a-chip system with Point-of-Care testing capability offers rapid and accurate diagnostic potential and is useful in resource-limited settings where biomedical equipment and skilled professionals are not readily available. However, a Point-of-Care testing system that simultaneously possesses all required features of multifunctional dispensing, on-demand release, robust operations, and capability for long-term reagent storage is still a major challenge. Here, we describe a film-lever actuated switch technology that can manipulate liquids in any direction, provide accurate and proportional release response to the applied pneumatic pressure, as well as sustain robustness during abrupt movements and vibrations. Based on the technology, we also describe development of a polymerase chain reaction system that integrates reagent introduction, mixing and reaction functions all in one process, which accomplishes “sample-in-answer-out” performance for all clinical nasal samples from 18 patients with Influenza and 18 individual controls, in good concordance of fluorescence intensity with standard polymerase chain reaction (Pearson coefficients > 0.9). The proposed platform promises robust automation of biomedical analysis, and thus can accelerate the commercialization of a range of Point-of-Care testing devices.","Point-of-care testing offers rapid and accurate diagnostic potential being quite useful in resource-limited settings. Here, authors demonstrate a film-lever actuated switch technology for microfluidic manipulation enabling multifunctional dispensing, on-demand release, robust operation, and long-term storage.",2022-08-20
634,A global assessment of the mixed layer in coastal sediments and implications for carbon storage,"The sediment-water interface in the coastal ocean is a highly dynamic zone controlling biogeochemical fluxes of greenhouse gases, nutrients, and metals. Processes in the sediment mixed layer (SML) control the transfer and reactivity of both particulate and dissolved matter in coastal interfaces. Here we map the global distribution of the coastal SML based on excess 210Pb (210Pbex) profiles and then use a neural network model to upscale these observations. We show that highly dynamic regions such as large estuaries have thicker SMLs than most oceanic sediments. Organic carbon preservation and SMLs are inversely related as mixing stimulates oxidation in sediments which enhances organic matter decomposition. Sites with SML thickness >60 cm usually have lower organic carbon accumulation rates (<50 g C m−2 yr−1) and total organic carbon/specific surface area ratios (<0.4 mg m−2). Our global scale observations reveal that reworking can accelerate organic matter degradation and reduce carbon storage in coastal sediments.","The authors map the global distribution of the mixed layer in coastal ocean sediments, based on a neural network model. These observations reveal that mixing can accelerate organic matter degradation and reduce carbon storage in the coastal ocean.",2022-08-20
635,Global systematic review with meta-analysis shows that warming effects on terrestrial plant biomass allocation are influenced by precipitation and mycorrhizal association,"Biomass allocation in plants is fundamental for understanding and predicting terrestrial carbon storage. Yet, our knowledge regarding warming effects on root: shoot ratio (R/S) remains limited. Here, we present a meta-analysis encompassing more than 300 studies and including angiosperms and gymnosperms as well as different biomes (cropland, desert, forest, grassland, tundra, and wetland). The meta-analysis shows that average warming of 2.50 °C (median = 2 °C) significantly increases biomass allocation to roots with a mean increase of 8.1% in R/S. Two factors associate significantly with this response to warming: mean annual precipitation and the type of mycorrhizal fungi associated with plants. Warming-induced allocation to roots is greater in drier habitats when compared to shoots (+15.1% in R/S), while lower in wetter habitats (+4.9% in R/S). This R/S pattern is more frequent in plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, compared to ectomycorrhizal fungi. These results show that precipitation variability and mycorrhizal association can affect terrestrial carbon dynamics by influencing biomass allocation strategies in a warmer world, suggesting that climate change could influence belowground C sequestration.","Biomass allocation in plants is fundamental for understanding and predicting terrestrial carbon storage. Here, the authors conduct a meta-analysis showing that warming effect on plant root:shoot is influenced by precipitation and the type of mycorrhizal fungi associated.",2022-08-20
636,Flavin-enabled reductive and oxidative epoxide ring opening reactions,"Epoxide ring opening reactions are common and important in both biological processes and synthetic applications and can be catalyzed in a non-redox manner by epoxide hydrolases or reductively by oxidoreductases. Here we report that fluostatins (FSTs), a family of atypical angucyclines with a benzofluorene core, can undergo nonenzyme-catalyzed epoxide ring opening reactions in the presence of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The 2,3-epoxide ring in FST C is shown to open reductively via a putative enol intermediate, or oxidatively via a peroxylated intermediate with molecular oxygen as the oxidant. These reactions lead to multiple products with different redox states that possess a single hydroxyl group at C-2, a 2,3-vicinal diol, a contracted five-membered A-ring, or an expanded seven-membered A-ring. Similar reactions also take place in both natural products and other organic compounds harboring an epoxide adjacent to a carbonyl group that is conjugated to an aromatic moiety. Our findings extend the repertoire of known flavin chemistry that may provide new and useful tools for organic synthesis.","Epoxide ring opening reactions are important in both biological processes and synthetic applications. Here, the authors show that flavin cofactors can catalyze reductive and oxidative epoxide ring opening reactions and propose the underlying mechanisms.",2022-08-20
637,A nanopore interface for higher bandwidth DNA computing,"DNA has emerged as a powerful substrate for programming information processing machines at the nanoscale. Among the DNA computing primitives used today, DNA strand displacement (DSD) is arguably the most popular, with DSD-based circuit applications ranging from disease diagnostics to molecular artificial neural networks. The outputs of DSD circuits are generally read using fluorescence spectroscopy. However, due to the spectral overlap of typical small-molecule fluorescent reporters, the number of unique outputs that can be detected in parallel is limited, requiring complex optical setups or spatial isolation of reactions to make output bandwidths scalable. Here, we present a multiplexable sequencing-free readout method that enables real-time, kinetic measurement of DSD circuit activity through highly parallel, direct detection of barcoded output strands using nanopore sensor array technology (Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ MinION device). These results increase DSD output bandwidth by an order of magnitude over what is currently feasible with fluorescence spectroscopy.",Toe-hold-mediated strand displacement (DSD) is a widely used molecular tool in applications such as DNA computing and nucleic acid diagnostics. Here the authors characterize dozens of orthogonal barcode sequences that can be used for monitoring the output kinetics of multiplexed DSD reactions in real-time using a commercially-available portable nanopore array device.,2022-08-20
638,Codoped porous carbon nanofibres as a potassium metal host for nonaqueous K-ion batteries,"Potassium metal is an appealing alternative to lithium as an alkali metal anode for future electrochemical energy storage systems. However, the use of potassium metal is hindered by the growth of unfavourable deposition (e.g., dendrites) and volume changes upon cycling. To circumvent these issues, we propose the synthesis and application of nitrogen and zinc codoped porous carbon nanofibres that act as potassium metal hosts. This carbonaceous porous material enables rapid potassium infusion (e.g., < 1 s cm−2) with a high potassium content (e.g., 97 wt. %) and low potassium nucleation overpotential (e.g., 15 mV at 0.5 mA cm−2). Experimental and theoretical measurements and analyses demonstrate that the carbon nanofibres induce uniform potassium deposition within its porous network and facilitate a dendrite-free morphology during asymmetric and symmetric cell cycling. Interestingly, when the potassium-infused carbon material is tested as an active negative electrode material in combination with a sulfur-based positive electrode and a nonaqueous electrolyte solution in the coin cell configuration, an average discharge voltage of approximately 1.6 V and a discharge capacity of approximately 470 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at 500 mA g−1 and 25 °C are achieved.","The use of electrochemical energy storage systems based on alkali metal electrodes is hindered by the dendrites’ growth and volume changes upon cycling. Here, the authors propose nitrogen and zinc co-doped porous carbon nanofibers as potassium metal hosting material for reversible metal deposition.",2022-08-20
639,Oxidative decomposition mechanisms of lithium carbonate on carbon substrates in lithium battery chemistries,"Lithium carbonate plays a critical role in both lithium-carbon dioxide and lithium-air batteries as the main discharge product and a product of side reactions, respectively. Understanding the decomposition of lithium carbonate during electrochemical oxidation (during battery charging) is key for improving both chemistries, but the decomposition mechanisms and the role of the carbon substrate remain under debate. Here, we use an in-situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry-gas chromatography coupling system to quantify the gas evolution during the electrochemical oxidation of lithium carbonate on carbon substrates. Our results show that lithium carbonate decomposes to carbon dioxide and singlet oxygen mainly via an electrochemical process instead of via a chemical process in an electrolyte of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in tetraglyme. Singlet oxygen attacks the carbon substrate and electrolyte to form both carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide—approximately 20% of the net gas evolved originates from these side reactions. Additionally, we show that cobalt(II,III) oxide, a typical oxygen evolution catalyst, stabilizes the precursor of singlet oxygen, thus inhibiting the formation of singlet oxygen and consequent side reactions.","Lithium carbonate is ubiquitous in lithium battery chemistries and leads to overpotentials, however its oxidative decomposition is unclear. Here, the authors study its decomposition in ether electrolyte, clarify the role of the carbon substrate, and propose a route to limit released singlet oxygen.",2022-08-20
640,Spatiotemporal-resolved protein networks profiling with photoactivation dependent proximity labeling,"Enzymatic-based proximity labeling approaches based on activated esters or phenoxy radicals have been widely used for mapping subcellular proteome and protein interactors in living cells. However, activated esters are poorly reactive which leads to a wide labeling radius and phenoxy radicals generated by peroxide treatment may disturb redox-sensitive pathways. Herein, we report a photoactivation-dependent proximity labeling (PDPL) method designed by genetically attaching photosensitizer protein miniSOG to a protein of interest. Triggered by blue light and tunned by irradiation time, singlet oxygen is generated, thereafter enabling spatiotemporally-resolved aniline probe labeling of histidine residues. We demonstrate its high-fidelity through mapping of organelle-specific proteomes. Side-by-side comparison of PDPL with TurboID reveals more specific and deeper proteomic coverage by PDPL. We further apply PDPL to the disease-related transcriptional coactivator BRD4 and E3 ligase Parkin, and discover previously unknown interactors. Through over-expression screening, two unreported substrates Ssu72 and SNW1 are identified for Parkin, whose degradation processes are mediated by the ubiquitination-proteosome pathway.","Methods to identify protein interaction networks often suffer from poor spatiotemporal resolution. Here the authors present a light-activated proximity labeling method where the protein of interest is fused to the photosensitizer protein miniSOG, allowing temporally resolved labeling of interactors.",2022-08-20
641,Earlier Alzheimer’s disease onset is associated with tau pathology in brain hub regions and facilitated tau spreading,"In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), younger symptom onset is associated with accelerated disease progression and tau spreading, yet the mechanisms underlying faster disease manifestation are unknown. To address this, we combined resting-state fMRI and longitudinal tau-PET in two independent samples of controls and biomarker-confirmed AD patients (ADNI/BioFINDER, n = 240/57). Consistent across both samples, we found that younger symptomatic AD patients showed stronger tau-PET in globally connected fronto-parietal hubs, i.e., regions that are critical for maintaining cognition in AD. Stronger tau-PET in hubs predicted faster subsequent tau accumulation, suggesting that tau in globally connected regions facilitates connectivity-mediated tau spreading. Further, stronger tau-PET in hubs mediated the association between younger age and faster tau accumulation in symptomatic AD patients, which predicted faster cognitive decline. These independently validated findings suggest that younger AD symptom onset is associated with stronger tau pathology in brain hubs, and accelerated tau spreading throughout connected brain regions and cognitive decline.","Individuals with young onset sporadic Alzheimer’s disease show faster pathological and clinical progression. Here the authors report that earlier symptom onset in Alzheimer’s disease is associated with higher tau pathology in globally connected brain hubs, accelerated connectivity-mediated tau spreading and faster cognitive decline.",2022-08-20
642,Mapping effective connectivity of human amygdala subdivisions with intracranial stimulation,"The primate amygdala is a complex consisting of over a dozen nuclei that have been implicated in a host of cognitive functions, individual differences, and psychiatric illnesses. These functions are implemented through distinct connectivity profiles, which have been documented in animals but remain largely unknown in humans. Here we present results from 25 neurosurgical patients who had concurrent electrical stimulation of the amygdala with intracranial electroencephalography (electrical stimulation tract-tracing; es-TT), or fMRI (electrical stimulation fMRI; es-fMRI), methods providing strong inferences about effective connectivity of amygdala subdivisions with the rest of the brain. We quantified functional connectivity with medial and lateral amygdala, the temporal order of these connections on the timescale of milliseconds, and also detail second-order effective connectivity among the key nodes. These findings provide a uniquely detailed characterization of human amygdala functional connectivity that will inform functional neuroimaging studies in healthy and clinical populations.","The amygdala is known to be engaged in emotional and autonomic function, yet the detailed functional connectivity of the human amygdala remains unclear.

643,Transposon-activated POU5F1B promotes colorectal cancer growth and metastasis,"The treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) is an unmet medical need in absence of early diagnosis. Here, upon characterizing cancer-specific transposable element-driven transpochimeric gene transcripts (TcGTs) produced by this tumor in the SYSCOL cohort, we find that expression of the hominid-restricted retrogene POU5F1B through aberrant activation of a primate-specific endogenous retroviral promoter is a strong negative prognostic biomarker. Correlating this observation, we demonstrate that POU5F1B fosters the proliferation and metastatic potential of CRC cells. We further determine that POU5F1B, in spite of its phylogenetic relationship with the POU5F1/OCT4 transcription factor, is a membrane-enriched protein that associates with protein kinases and known targets or interactors as well as with cytoskeleton-related molecules, and induces intracellular signaling events and the release of trans-acting factors involved in cell growth and cell adhesion. As POU5F1B is an apparently non-essential gene only lowly expressed in normal tissues, and as POU5F1B-containing TcGTs are detected in other tumors besides CRC, our data provide interesting leads for the development of cancer therapies.","The treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) is an unmet medical need in absence of early diagnosis. Here, the authors characterise cancer-specific transposable element-driven transpochimeric gene transcripts and highlight the role of POU5F1B in CRC growth and metastasis.",2022-08-20
644,Untangling the network effects of productivity and prominence among scientists,"While inequalities in science are common, most efforts to understand them treat scientists as isolated individuals, ignoring the network effects of collaboration. Here, we develop models that untangle the network effects of productivity defined as paper counts, and prominence referring to high-impact publications, of individual scientists from their collaboration networks. We find that gendered differences in the productivity and prominence of mid-career researchers can be largely explained by differences in their coauthorship networks. Hence, collaboration networks act as a form of social capital, and we find evidence of their transferability from senior to junior collaborators, with benefits that decay as researchers age. Collaboration network effects can also explain a large proportion of the productivity and prominence advantages held by researchers at prestigious institutions. These results highlight a substantial role of social networks in driving inequalities in science, and suggest that collaboration networks represent an important form of unequally distributed social capital that shapes who makes what scientific discoveries.","While inequalities in science are common, most efforts to understand them treat scientists as isolated individuals, ignoring the network effects of collaboration.

645,Photocatalytic cyclization of nitrogen-centered radicals with carbon nitride through promoting substrate/catalyst interaction,"The use of metal-free carbon nitride and light to drive catalytic transformations constitutes a sustainable strategy for organic synthesis. At the moment, enhancing the intrinsic activity of CN catalysts by tuning the interfacial coupling between catalyst and substrate remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that urea-derived carbon nitride catalysts with the abundant −NH2 groups and the relative positive charged surface could effectively complex with the deprotonated anionic intermediate to improve the adsorption of organic reactants on the catalyst surface. The decreased oxidation potential and upshift in its highest occupied molecular orbital position make the electron abstraction kinetics by the catalyst more energetically favorable. The prepared catalyst is thus utilized for the photocatalytic cyclization of nitrogen-centered radicals for the synthesis of diverse pharmaceutical-related compounds (33 examples) with high activity and reusability, which shows competent performance to the homogeneous catalysts.",Carbon nitride catalysts with positively charged surfaces and abundant −NH2 are found to be effective photocatalysts for dihydropyrazole synthesis. A surface-mediated mechanism where deprotonated intermediates interact with the surface is proposed.,2022-08-20
646,Integrated multi-omics reveals cellular and molecular interactions governing the invasive niche of basal cell carcinoma,"Tumors invade the surrounding tissues to progress, but the heterogeneity of cell types at the tumor-stroma interface and the complexity of their potential interactions hampered mechanistic insight required for efficient therapeutic targeting. Here, combining single-cell and spatial transcriptomics on human basal cell carcinomas, we define the cellular contributors of tumor progression. In the invasive niche, tumor cells exhibit a collective migration phenotype, characterized by the expression of cell-cell junction complexes. In physical proximity, we identify cancer-associated fibroblasts with extracellular matrix-remodeling features. Tumor cells strongly express the cytokine Activin A, and increased Activin A-induced gene signature is found in adjacent cancer-associated fibroblast subpopulations. Altogether, our data identify the cell populations and their transcriptional reprogramming contributing to the spatial organization of the basal cell carcinoma invasive niche. They also demonstrate the power of integrated spatial and single-cell multi-omics to decipher cancer-specific invasive properties and develop targeted therapies.","The role of reciprocal tumour-stroma interactions in tumour invasion remains poorly characterised.

647,Designing isolation guidelines for COVID-19 patients with rapid antigen tests,"Appropriate isolation guidelines for COVID-19 patients are warranted. Currently, isolating for fixed time is adopted in most countries. However, given the variability in viral dynamics between patients, some patients may no longer be infectious by the end of isolation, whereas others may still be infectious. Utilizing viral test results to determine isolation length would minimize both the risk of prematurely ending isolation of infectious patients and the unnecessary individual burden of redundant isolation of noninfectious patients. In this study, we develop a data-driven computational framework to compute the population-level risk and the burden of different isolation guidelines with rapid antigen tests (i.e., lateral flow tests). Here, we show that when the detection limit is higher than the infectiousness threshold values, additional consecutive negative results are needed to ascertain infectiousness status. Further, rapid antigen tests should be designed to have lower detection limits than infectiousness threshold values to minimize the length of prolonged isolation.","Utilizing viral test results to determine isolation length would minimize both the risk of prematurely ending isolation of infectious patients and the unnecessary individual burden of redundant isolation of noninfectious patients.

648,Split westerlies over Europe in the early Little Ice Age,"The Little Ice Age (LIA; ca. 1450–1850 C.E.) is the best documented cold period of the past millennium, characterized by high-frequency volcanism, low solar activity, and high variability of Arctic sea-ice cover. Past studies of LIA Atlantic circulation changes have referenced the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), but recent studies have noted that LIA climate patterns appear to possess complexity not captured by an NAO analogue. Here, we present a new precipitation-sensitive stalagmite record from northern Italy that covers the past 800 years. We show that in the early LIA (1470–1610 C.E.), increased atmospheric ridging over northern Europe split the climatological westerlies away from central and northern Europe, possibly caused by concurrent Artic sea-ice reduction. With ongoing ice melting in the northern high latitudes and decreasing solar irradiance in the coming years, the early LIA may potentially serve as an analogue for European hydroclimatic conditions in the coming decades.","A new stalagmite record from northern Italy and other published data from Europe and northern Africa reveals a split in the climatological westerlies during the early LIA, possibly attributed to sea ice melting.",2022-08-20
649,Ultralong organic phosphorescence from isolated molecules with repulsive interactions for multifunctional applications,"Intermolecular interactions, including attractive and repulsive interactions, play a vital role in manipulating functionalization of the materials from micro to macro dimensions. Despite great success in generation of ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) by suppressing non-radiative transitions through attractive interactions recently, there is still no consideration of repulsive interactions on UOP. Herein, we proposed a feasible approach by introducing carboxyl groups into organic phosphors, enabling formation of the intense repulsive interactions between the isolated molecules and the matrix in rigid environment. Our experimental results show a phosphor with a record lifetime and quantum efficiency up to 3.16 s and 50.0% simultaneously in film under ambient conditions. Considering the multiple functions of the flexible films, the potential applications in anti-counterfeiting, afterglow display and visual frequency indicators were demonstrated. This finding not only outlines a fundamental principle to achieve bright organic phosphorescence in film, but also expands the potential applications of UOP materials.","Despite great success in generation of ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) by suppressing non-radiative transitions through attractive interactions, consideration of repulsive interactions on UOP remains largely unexplored.

650,Multifunctional graphene heterogeneous nanochannel with voltage-tunable ion selectivity,"Ion-selective nanoporous two-dimensional (2D) materials have shown extraordinary potential in energy conversion, ion separation, and nanofluidic devices; however, different applications require diverse nanochannel devices with different ion selectivity, which is limited by sample preparation and experimental techniques. Herein, we develop a heterogeneous graphene-based polyethylene terephthalate nanochannel (GPETNC) with controllable ion sieving to overcome those difficulties. Simply by adjusting the applied voltage, ion selectivity among K+, Na+, Li+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ of the GPETNC can be immediately tuned. At negative voltages, the GPETNC serves as a mono/divalent ion selective device by impeding most divalent cations to transport through; at positive voltages, it mimics a biological K+ nanochannel, which conducts K+ much more rapidly than the other ions with K+/ions selectivity up to about 4.6. Besides, the GPETNC also exhibits the promise as a cation-responsive nanofluidic diode with the ability to rectify ion currents. Theoretical calculations indicate that the voltage-dependent ion enrichment/depletion inside the GPETNC affects the effective surface charge density of the utilized graphene subnanopores and thus leads to the electrically controllable ion sieving. This work provides ways to develop heterogeneous nanochannels with tunable ion selectivity toward broad applications.",Nanoporous 2D materials have shown promising potential for ion sieving applications due to their physical and chemical properties.

651,Temporally restricted activation of IFNβ signaling underlies response to immune checkpoint therapy in mice,"The biological determinants of the response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer remain incompletely understood. Little is known about dynamic biological events that underpin therapeutic efficacy due to the inability to frequently sample tumours in patients. Here, we map the transcriptional profiles of 144 responding and non-responding tumours within two mouse models at four time points during ICB. We find that responding tumours display on/fast-off kinetics of type-I-interferon (IFN) signaling. Phenocopying of this kinetics using time-dependent sequential dosing of recombinant IFNs and neutralizing antibodies markedly improves ICB efficacy, but only when IFNβ is targeted, not IFNα. We identify Ly6C+/CD11b+ inflammatory monocytes as the primary source of IFNβ and find that active type-I-IFN signaling in tumour-infiltrating inflammatory monocytes is associated with T cell expansion in patients treated with ICB. Together, our results suggest that on/fast-off modulation of IFNβ signaling is critical to the therapeutic response to ICB, which can be exploited to drive clinical outcomes towards response.","Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is partially successful as a cancer therapy. Here using mouse models, the authors transcriptionally monitor responding and non-responding tumours showing that responding tumours were associated with transient IFN-β signalling which could promote the anti-tumour response.",2022-08-19
652,Moisture-triggered fast crystallization enables efficient and stable perovskite solar cells,"Understanding the function of moisture on perovskite is challenging since the random environmental moisture strongly disturbs the perovskite structure. Here, we develop various N2-protected characterization techniques to comprehensively study the effect of moisture on the efficient cesium, methylammonium, and formamidinium triple-cation perovskite (Cs0.05FA0.75MA0.20)Pb(I0.96Br0.04)3. In contrast to the secondary measurements, the established air-exposure-free techniques allow us directly monitor the influence of moisture during perovskite crystallization. We find a controllable moisture treatment for the intermediate perovskite can promote the mass transportation of organic salts, and help them enter the buried bottom of the films. This process accelerates the quasi-solid-solid reaction between organic salts and PbI2, enables a spatially homogeneous intermediate phase, and translates to high-quality perovskites with much-suppressed defects. Consequently, we obtain a champion device efficiency of approaching 24% with negligible hysteresis. The devices exhibit an average T80-lifetime of 852 h (maximum 1210 h) working at the maximum power point.","Perovskite structure is disturbed by environmental moisture, limiting the device performance. Here, Wei et al. monitor the effect of moisture during the growth by N2-protected characterization techniques, and obtain an operationally stable perovskite solar cell with efficiency approaching 24%.",2022-08-19
653,Permian hypercarnivore suggests dental complexity among early amniotes,"The oldest known complex terrestrial vertebrate community included hypercarnivorous varanopids, a successful clade of amniotes with wide geographic and temporal distributions. Little is known about their dentition and feeding behaviour, but with the unprecedented number of specimens of the varanopid Mesenosaurus from cave deposits in Oklahoma, we show that it exhibited serrations on the tooth crowns, and exceptionally rapid rates of development and reduced longevity relative to other terrestrial amniotes. In contrast, the coeval large apex predator Dimetrodon greatly increased dental longevity by increasing thickness and massiveness, whereas herbivores greatly reduced tooth replacement rates and increased dental longevity. Insectivores and omnivores represented the primitive condition and maintained modest replacement rates and longevity. The varied patterns of dental development among these early terrestrial amniotes reveal a hidden aspect of dental complexity in the emerging diverse amniote community, very soon after their initial appearance in the fossil record.","Dental development and replacement rates varied greatly among early terrestrial carnivorous and herbivorous amniotes, revealing a complexity that reflected a diversity of feeding behaviours soon after their initial appearance in the fossil record.",2022-08-19
654,Geoelectrochemistry-driven alteration of amino acids to derivative organics in carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies,"A long-standing question regarding carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) is how the CCs’ organics were sourced and converted before and after the accretion of their parent bodies. Growing evidence shows that amino acid abundances in CCs decrease with an elongated aqueous alteration. However, the underlying chemical processes are unclear. If CCs’ parent bodies were water-rock differentiated, pH and redox gradients can drive electrochemical reactions by using H2 as an electron source. Here, we simulate such redox conditions and demonstrate that α-amino acids are electrochemically altered to monoamines and α-hydroxy acids on FeS and NiS catalysts at 25 °C. This conversion is consistent with their enrichment compared to amino acid analogs in heavily altered CCs. Our results thus suggest that H2 can be an important driver for organic evolution in water-rock differentiated CC parent bodies as well as the Solar System icy bodies that might possess similar pH and redox gradients.","Researchers at Earth-Life Science Institute (ELSI) discovered a chemical process that can explain the very low amino acid abundances in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites, deepening our understanding on the Solar System chemical evolution.",2022-08-19
655,Increasing sensitivity of dryland vegetation greenness to precipitation due to rising atmospheric CO2,"Water availability plays a critical role in shaping terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in low- and mid-latitude regions. The sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation strongly regulates global vegetation dynamics and their responses to drought, yet sensitivity changes in response to climate change remain poorly understood. Here we use long-term satellite observations combined with a dynamic statistical learning approach to examine changes in the sensitivity of vegetation greenness to precipitation over the past four decades. We observe a robust increase in precipitation sensitivity (0.624% yr−1) for drylands, and a decrease (−0.618% yr−1) for wet regions. Using model simulations, we show that the contrasting trends between dry and wet regions are caused by elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2). eCO2 universally decreases the precipitation sensitivity by reducing leaf-level transpiration, particularly in wet regions. However, in drylands, this leaf-level transpiration reduction is overridden at the canopy scale by a large proportional increase in leaf area. The increased sensitivity for global drylands implies a potential decrease in ecosystem stability and greater impacts of droughts in these vulnerable ecosystems under continued global change.",Changes in vegetation responses to precipitation may be hydroclimate dependent. Here the authors reveal contrasting trends of vegetation sensitivity to precipitation in drylands vs. wetter ecosystems over the last 4 decades and identify increased CO2 as a major contributing factor.,2022-08-19
656,Room-temperature electrical control of polarization and emission angle in a cavity-integrated 2D pulsed LED,"Devices based on two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors hold promise for the realization of compact and versatile on-chip interconnects between electrical and optical signals. Although light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fundamental building blocks for integrated photonics, the fabrication of light sources made of bulk materials on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) circuits is challenging. While LEDs based on van der Waals heterostructures have been realized, the control of the emission properties necessary for information processing remains limited. Here, we show room-temperature electrical control of the location, directionality and polarization of light emitted from a 2D LED operating at MHz frequencies. We integrate the LED in a planar cavity to couple the polariton emission angle and polarization to the in-plane exciton momentum, controlled by a lateral voltage. These findings demonstrate the potential of TMDCs as fast, compact and tunable light sources, promising for the realization of electrically driven polariton lasers.","2D semiconductors offer a promising platform for the realization of compact and CMOS-compatible optoelectronic components. Here, the authors report the realization of light-emitting diodes based on 2D WSe2 integrated with a planar cavity, showing the electrical control of the emission angle and polarization at room temperature.",2022-08-19
657,Temperature-dependent dual-mode thermal management device with net zero energy for year-round energy saving,"Reducing needs for heating and cooling from fossil energy is one of the biggest challenges, which demand accounts for almost half of global energy consumption, consequently resulting in complicated climatic and environmental issues. Herein, we demonstrate a high-performance, intelligently auto-switched and zero-energy dual-mode radiative thermal management device. By perceiving temperature to spontaneously modulate electromagnetic characteristics itself, the device achieves ~859.8 W m−2 of average heating power (∼91% of solar-thermal conversion efficiency) in cold and ~126.0 W m−2 of average cooling power in hot, without any external energy consumption during the whole process. Such a scalable, cost-effective device could realize two-way temperature control around comfortable temperature zone of human living. A practical demonstration shows that the temperature fluctuation is reduced by ~21 K, compared with copper plate. Numerical prediction indicates that this real zero-energy dual-mode thermal management device has a huge potential for year-round energy saving around the world and provides a feasible solution to realize the goal of Net Zero Carbon 2050.","Real-world practical utilization of zero-energy thermal management systems often requires adaptability to dynamic weather.

658,Immune-mediated tubule atrophy promotes acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease transition,"Incomplete repair after acute kidney injury can lead to development of chronic kidney disease. To define the mechanism of this response, we compared mice subjected to identical unilateral ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury with either contralateral nephrectomy (where tubule repair predominates) or contralateral kidney intact (where tubule atrophy predominates). By day 14, the kidneys undergoing atrophy had more macrophages with higher expression of chemokines, correlating with a second wave of proinflammatory neutrophil and T cell recruitment accompanied by increased expression of tubular injury genes and a decreased proportion of differentiated tubules. Depletion of neutrophils and T cells after day 5 reduced tubular cell loss and associated kidney atrophy. In kidney biopsies from patients with acute kidney injury, T cell and neutrophil numbers negatively correlated with recovery of estimated glomerular filtration rate. Together, our findings demonstrate that macrophage persistence after injury promotes a T cell- and neutrophil-mediated proinflammatory milieu and progressive tubule damage.","Acute kidney injury can lead to chronic kidney disease. Here the authors show that the transition is related to a macrophage-mediated second wave of inflammatory cells that promote late tubule injury, dedifferentiation and fibrosis. Suppressing this second wave reduced tubular loss and kidney atrophy.",2022-08-19
659,Crystal structures reveal catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of the dual-specificity ubiquitin/FAT10 E1 enzyme Uba6,"The E1 enzyme Uba6 initiates signal transduction by activating ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like protein FAT10 in a two-step process involving sequential catalysis of adenylation and thioester bond formation. To gain mechanistic insights into these processes, we determined the crystal structure of a human Uba6/ubiquitin complex. Two distinct architectures of the complex are observed: one in which Uba6 adopts an open conformation with the active site configured for catalysis of adenylation, and a second drastically different closed conformation in which the adenylation active site is disassembled and reconfigured for catalysis of thioester bond formation. Surprisingly, an inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) molecule binds to a previously unidentified allosteric site on Uba6. Our structural, biochemical, and biophysical data indicate that InsP6 allosterically inhibits Uba6 activity by altering interconversion of the open and closed conformations of Uba6 while also enhancing its stability. In addition to revealing the molecular mechanisms of catalysis by Uba6 and allosteric regulation of its activities, our structures provide a framework for developing Uba6-specific inhibitors and raise the possibility of allosteric regulation of other E1s by naturally occurring cellular metabolites.","Uba6 is an E1 enzyme that regulates numerous cellular processes by activating ubiquitin and FAT10 pathways. Here, the authors present crystal structures that illuminate Uba6 catalytic mechanisms and reveal inositol hexakisphosphate as a cofactor that modulates Uba6 activity.",2022-08-19
660,Ferritin-mediated iron detoxification promotes hypothermia survival in Caenorhabditis elegans and murine neurons,"How animals rewire cellular programs to survive cold is a fascinating problem with potential biomedical implications, ranging from emergency medicine to space travel. Studying a hibernation-like response in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we uncovered a regulatory axis that enhances the natural resistance of nematodes to severe cold. This axis involves conserved transcription factors, DAF-16/FoxO and PQM-1, which jointly promote cold survival by upregulating FTN-1, a protein related to mammalian ferritin heavy chain (FTH1). Moreover, we show that inducing expression of FTH1 also promotes cold survival of mammalian neurons, a cell type particularly sensitive to deterioration in hypothermia. Our findings in both animals and cells suggest that FTN-1/FTH1 facilitates cold survival by detoxifying ROS-generating iron species. We finally show that mimicking the effects of FTN-1/FTH1 with drugs protects neurons from cold-induced degeneration, opening a potential avenue to improved treatments of hypothermia.","Strategies to improve cold resistance are of potential biomedical interest. Here the authors demonstrate that ferritin-mediated detoxification of iron, preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species, promotes cold survival in both Caenorhabditis elegans and cultured mammalian neurons.",2022-08-19
661,In situ structure and dynamics of an alphacoronavirus spike protein by cryo-ET and cryo-EM,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious swine disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). PED causes enteric disorders with an exceptionally high fatality in neonates, bringing substantial economic losses in the pork industry. The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein of PEDV is responsible for virus-host recognition, membrane fusion, and is the main target for vaccine development and antigenic analysis. The atomic structures of the recombinant PEDV S proteins of two different strains have been reported, but they reveal distinct N-terminal domain 0 (D0) architectures that may correspond to different functional states. The existence of the D0 is a unique feature of alphacoronavirus. Here we combined cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to demonstrate in situ the asynchronous S protein D0 motions on intact viral particles of a highly virulent PEDV Pintung 52 strain. We further determined the cryo-EM structure of the recombinant S protein derived from a porcine cell line, which revealed additional domain motions likely associated with receptor binding. By integrating mass spectrometry and cryo-EM, we delineated the complex compositions and spatial distribution of the PEDV S protein N-glycans, and demonstrated the functional role of a key N-glycan in modulating the D0 conformation.","Hsu and co-workers integrate cryo-electron tomography, cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry to reveal the structural polymorphism of a pig coronavirus spike protein within intact viral particles, and how glycosylation modulates the conformational changes pertinent to host recognition.",2022-08-19
662,Environmentally adaptive MOF-based device enables continuous self-optimizing atmospheric water harvesting,"Harvesting water vapor from desert, arid environments by metal-organic framework (MOF) based devices to deliver clean liquid water is critically dependent on environment and climate conditions. However, reported devices have yet been developed to adapt in real-time to such conditions during their operation, which severely limits water production efficiency and unnecessarily increases power consumption. Herein, we report and detail a mode of water harvesting operation, termed ‘adaptive water harvesting’, from which a MOF-based device is proven capable of adapting the adsorption and desorption phases of its water harvesting cycle to weather fluctuations throughout a given day, week, and month such that its water production efficiency is continuously optimized. In performance evaluation experiments in a desert, arid climate (17–32% relative humidity), the adaptive water harvesting device achieves a 169% increase in water production (3.5 LH2O kgMOF−1 d−1) when compared to the best-performing, reported active device (0.7–1.3 LH2O kgMOF−1 d−1 at 10–32% relative humidity), a lower power consumption (1.67–5.25 kWh LH2O−1), and saves time by requiring nearly 1.5 cycles less than a counterpart active device. Furthermore, the produced water meets the national drinking standards of a potential technology-adopting country.","Atmospheric water harvesting by MOF-based devices is critically dependent on weather conditions. Here, the authors report a MOF-based adaptive water harvesting system capable of adapting its cycles to temperature and relative humidity fluctuations throughout the day, continuously optimizing water production.",2022-08-19
663,Socially meaningful visual context either enhances or inhibits vocalisation processing in the macaque brain,"Social interactions rely on the interpretation of semantic and emotional information, often from multiple sensory modalities. Nonhuman primates send and receive auditory and visual communicative signals. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the association of visual and auditory information based on their common social meaning are unknown. Using heart rate estimates and functional neuroimaging, we show that in the lateral and superior temporal sulcus of the macaque monkey, neural responses are enhanced in response to species-specific vocalisations paired with a matching visual context, or when vocalisations follow, in time, visual information, but inhibited when vocalisation are incongruent with the visual context. For example, responses to affiliative vocalisations are enhanced when paired with affiliative contexts but inhibited when paired with aggressive or escape contexts. Overall, we propose that the identified neural network represents social meaning irrespective of sensory modality.","Social interaction involves processing semantic and emotional information. Here the authors show that in the macaque monkey lateral and superior temporal sulcus, cortical activity is enhanced in response to species-specific vocalisations predicted by matching face or social visual stimuli but inhibited when vocalisations are incongruent with the predictive visual context.",2022-08-19
664,Phylogenetically and catabolically diverse diazotrophs reside in deep-sea cold seep sediments,"Microbially mediated nitrogen cycling in carbon-dominated cold seep environments remains poorly understood. So far anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-2) and their sulfate-reducing bacterial partners (SEEP-SRB1 clade) have been identified as diazotrophs in deep sea cold seep sediments. However, it is unclear whether other microbial groups can perform nitrogen fixation in such ecosystems. To fill this gap, we analyzed 61 metagenomes, 1428 metagenome-assembled genomes, and six metatranscriptomes derived from 11 globally distributed cold seeps. These sediments contain phylogenetically diverse nitrogenase genes corresponding to an expanded diversity of diazotrophic lineages. Diverse catabolic pathways were predicted to provide ATP for nitrogen fixation, suggesting diazotrophy in cold seeps is not necessarily associated with sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane. Nitrogen fixation genes among various diazotrophic groups in cold seeps were inferred to be genetically mobile and subject to purifying selection. Our findings extend the capacity for diazotrophy to five candidate phyla (Altarchaeia, Omnitrophota, FCPU426, Caldatribacteriota and UBA6262), and suggest that cold seep diazotrophs might contribute substantially to the global nitrogen balance.","Microbial nitrogen fixation could be important in the deep sea. Here the authors investigate metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of diazotrophs from deep sea cold seep sediments, reveal greater phylogenetic and functional diversity than hitherto known.",2022-08-19
665,Modelling the medium-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in England in the Omicron era,"England has experienced a heavy burden of COVID-19, with multiple waves of SARS-CoV-2 transmission since early 2020 and high infection levels following the emergence and spread of Omicron variants since late 2021. In response to rising Omicron cases, booster vaccinations were accelerated and offered to all adults in England. Using a model fitted to more than 2 years of epidemiological data, we project potential dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospital admissions and deaths in England to December 2022. We consider key uncertainties including future behavioural change and waning immunity and assess the effectiveness of booster vaccinations in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 disease burden between October 2021 and December 2022. If no new variants emerge, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is expected to decline, with low levels remaining in the coming months. The extent to which projected SARS-CoV-2 transmission resurges later in 2022 depends largely on assumptions around waning immunity and to some extent, behaviour, and seasonality.",This mathematical modelling study projects the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in England until the end of 2022 assuming that the Omicron BA.2 sublineage remains dominant. They show that booster vaccination was highly effective in mitigating severe outcomes and that future dynamics will depend greatly on assumptions about waning immunity.,2022-08-19
666,Toward a BT.2020 green emitter through a combined multiple resonance effect and multi-lock strategy,"Color-saturated green-emitting molecules with high Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) y values have great potential applications for displays and imaging. Here, we linked the outer phenyl groups in multiple-resonance (MR)-type blue-emitting B (boron)-N (nitrogen) molecules through bonding and spiro-carbon bridges, resulting in rigid green emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The MR effect and multiple interlocking strategy greatly suppressed the high-frequency vibrations in the molecules, which emit green light with a full-width at half-maximum of 14 nm and a CIE y value of 0.77 in cyclohexane. These were the purest green molecules with quantum efficiency and color purity that were comparable with current best quantum dots. Doping these emitters into a traditional green-emitting phosphorescence organic light-emitting diode (OLED) endowed the device with a Broadcast Service Television 2020 color-gamut, 50% improved external quantum efficiency, and an extremely high luminescence of 5.1 × 105 cd/m2, making it the greenest and brightest OLED ever reported.","The authors combine multiple resonance effect and multi-lock strategy to dope green-emitting thermally activated delayed fluorescent molecules into green-emitting phosphorescence OLEDs by endowing the device with a Broadcast Service Television 2020 color-gamut, 50% improved EQE, and a high luminescence of half a million nits.",2022-08-19
667,SARS CoV-2 mRNA vaccination exposes latent HIV to Nef-specific CD8+ T-cells,"Efforts to cure HIV have focused on reactivating latent proviruses to enable elimination by CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. Clinical studies of latency reversing agents (LRA) in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals have shown increases in HIV transcription, but without reductions in virologic measures, or evidence that HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells were productively engaged. Here, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 activates the RIG-I/TLR – TNF – NFκb axis, resulting in transcription of HIV proviruses with minimal perturbations of T-cell activation and host transcription. T-cells specific for the early gene-product HIV-Nef uniquely increased in frequency and acquired effector function (granzyme-B) in ART-treated individuals following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. These parameters of CD8+ T-cell induction correlated with significant decreases in cell-associated HIV mRNA, suggesting killing or suppression of cells transcribing HIV. Thus, we report the observation of an intervention-induced reduction in a measure of HIV persistence, accompanied by precise immune correlates, in ART-suppressed individuals. However, we did not observe significant depletions of intact proviruses, underscoring challenges to achieving (or measuring) HIV reservoir reductions. Overall, our results support prioritizing the measurement of granzyme-B-producing Nef-specific responses in latency reversal studies and add impetus to developing HIV-targeted mRNA therapeutic vaccines that leverage built-in LRA activity.","Here, the authors show in a cohort of people with HIV, COVID mRNA vaccination is followed by a transient boost in a particular profile of HIV-specific T-cell responses and a corresponding decrease in residual HIV RNA – suggesting productive immune engagement with infected cells.",2022-08-19
668,Achieving thermally stable nanoparticles in chemically complex alloys via controllable sluggish lattice diffusion,"Nanoparticle strengthening provides a crucial basis for developing high-performance structural materials with potentially superb mechanical properties for structural applications. However, the general wisdom often fails to work well due to the poor thermal stability of nanoparticles, and the rapid coarsening of these particles will lead to the accelerated failures of these materials especially at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to achieve ultra-stable nanoparticles at 800~1000 °C in a Ni59.9-xCoxFe13Cr15Al6Ti6B0.1 (at.%) chemically complex alloy, resulting from the controllable sluggish lattice diffusion (SLD) effect. Our diffusion kinetic simulations reveal that the Co element leads to a significant reduction in the interdiffusion coefficients of all the main elements, especially for the Al element, with a maximum of up to 5 orders of magnitude. Utilizing first-principles calculations, we further unveil the incompressibility of Al induced by the increased concentration of Co plays a critical role in controlling the SLD effect. These findings are useful for providing advances in the design of novel structural alloys with extraordinary property-microstructure stability combinations for structural applications.","Nanoparticle strengthening provides a crucial basis for developing high-performance materials, which often fails to work due to poor thermal stability.

669,Introducing Brønsted acid sites to accelerate the bridging-oxygen-assisted deprotonation in acidic water oxidation,"Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) consists of four sequential proton-coupled electron transfer steps, which suffer from sluggish kinetics even on state-of-the-art ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) catalysts. Understanding and controlling the proton transfer process could be an effective strategy to improve OER performances. Herein, we present a strategy to accelerate the deprotonation of OER intermediates by introducing strong Brønsted acid sites (e.g. tungsten oxides, WOx) into the RuO2. The Ru-W binary oxide is reported as a stable and active iridium-free acidic OER catalyst that exhibits a low overpotential (235 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and low degradation rate (0.014 mV h−1) over a 550-hour stability test. Electrochemical studies, in-situ near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory show that the W-O-Ru Brønsted acid sites are instrumental to facilitate proton transfer from the oxo-intermediate to the neighboring bridging oxygen sites, thus accelerating bridging-oxygen-assisted deprotonation OER steps in acidic electrolytes. The universality of the strategy is demonstrated for other Ru-M binary metal oxides (M = Cr, Mo, Nb, Ta, and Ti).","While water electrolysis devices represent a technology for renewable energy, there are few stable catalysts that survive the acidic conditions. Here, authors enhance acidic oxygen evolution by introducing strong Brønsted acid sites into RuO2 to accelerate bridging-oxygen-assisted deprotonation.",2022-08-18
670,High-performance piezoelectric composites via β phase programming,"Polymer-ceramic piezoelectric composites, combining high piezoelectricity and mechanical flexibility, have attracted increasing interest in both academia and industry. However, their piezoelectric activity is largely limited by intrinsically low crystallinity and weak spontaneous polarization. Here, we propose a Ti3C2Tx MXene anchoring method to manipulate the intermolecular interactions within the all-trans conformation of a polymer matrix. Employing phase-field simulation and molecular dynamics calculations, we show that OH surface terminations on the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets offer hydrogen bonding with the fluoropolymer matrix, leading to dipole alignment and enhanced net spontaneous polarization of the polymer-ceramic composites. We then translated this interfacial bonding strategy into electrospinning to boost the piezoelectric response of samarium doped Pb (Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3/polyvinylidene fluoride composite nanofibers by 160% via Ti3C2Tx nanosheets inclusion. With excellent piezoelectric and mechanical attributes, the as-electrospun piezoelectric nanofibers can be easily integrated into the conventional shoe insoles to form a foot sensor network for all-around gait patterns monitoring, walking habits identification and Metatarsalgi prognosis. This work utilizes the interfacial coupling mechanism of intermolecular anchoring as a strategy to develop high-performance piezoelectric composites for wearable electronics.","The piezoelectricity of PVDF composites is mainly determined by the crystalline phases and spontaneous polarization. Here, the authors propose a Ti3C2Tx anchoring method to modulate the molecular interactions and conformation of polymer matrix.",2022-08-18
671,Sustained and intensified lacustrine methane cycling during Early Permian climate warming,"Lakes are a major emitter of the atmospheric greenhouse gas methane (CH4); however, their roles in past climate warming episodes remain poorly understood owing to a scarcity of geological records. Here we report the occurrence of sustained and intensified microbial CH4 cycling in paleo-Lake Junggar in northwestern China, one of the largest known Phanerozoic lakes, during Early Permian climate warming. High-precision U-Pb geochronology refines the age of the upper Lucaogou Formation to the Artinskian, which marks a major glacial-to-postglacial climate transition. The 13C-enriched authigenic dolomites indicate active methanogenesis in the anoxic lake sediments, and 13C-depleted hopanes suggest vigorous methanotrophy in the water column. The intensification of CH4 cycling coincided with increasing global temperature, as evidenced from elevated continental chemical weathering. Our results suggest that the lacustrine CH4 emissions acted as a positive feedback to global warming and contributed to the demise of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age.",This study reports the occurrence of sustained and intensified microbial CH4 cycling in a giant lake in northwestern China during Early Permian climate warming. Lacustrine CH4 emissions may have contributed to the end of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age.,2022-08-18
672,Inorganic nanosheets facilitate humoral immunity against medical implant infections by modulating immune co-stimulatory pathways,"Strategies to manipulate immune cell co-inhibitory or co-activating signals have revolutionized immunotherapy. However, certain immunologically cold diseases, such as bacterial biofilm infections of medical implants are hard to target due to the complexity of the immune co-stimulatory pathways involved. Here we show that two-dimensional manganese chalcogenophosphates MnPSe3 (MPS) nanosheets modified with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are capable of triggering a strong anti-bacterial biofilm humoral immunity in a mouse model of surgical implant infection via modulating antigen presentation and costimulatory molecule expression in the infectious microenvironment (IME). Mechanistically, the PVP-modified MPS (MPS-PVP) damages the structure of the biofilm which results in antigen exposure by generating reactive oxidative species, while changing the balance of immune-inhibitory (IL4I1 and CD206) and co-activator signals (CD40, CD80 and CD69). This leads to amplified APC priming and antigen presentation, resulting in biofilm-specific humoral immune and memory responses. In our work, we demonstrate that pre-surgical neoadjuvant immunotherapy utilizing MPS-PVP successfully mitigates residual and recurrent infections following removal of the infected implants. This study thus offers an alternative to replace antibiotics against hard-to-treat biofilm infections.","Bacterial biofilm formation is a major risk of surgical implantation, and necessitates implant removal and aggressive antibiotic treatment. Here authors show that post-surgical application of Manganese-containing inorganic nanosheets reduces residual and recurrent infection by improving antigen presentation and humoral immune response against the biofilms.",2022-08-18
673,Rubisco forms a lattice inside alpha-carboxysomes,"Despite the importance of microcompartments in prokaryotic biology and bioengineering, structural heterogeneity has prevented a complete understanding of their architecture, ultrastructure, and spatial organization. Here, we employ cryo-electron tomography to image α-carboxysomes, a pseudo-icosahedral microcompartment responsible for carbon fixation. We have solved a high-resolution subtomogram average of the Rubisco cargo inside the carboxysome, and determined the arrangement of the enzyme. We find that the H. neapolitanus Rubisco polymerizes in vivo, mediated by the small Rubisco subunit. These fibrils can further pack to form a lattice with six-fold pseudo-symmetry. This arrangement preserves freedom of motion and accessibility around the Rubisco active site and the binding sites for two other carboxysome proteins, CsoSCA (a carbonic anhydrase) and the disordered CsoS2, even at Rubisco concentrations exceeding 800 μM. This characterization of Rubisco cargo inside the α-carboxysome provides insight into the balance between order and disorder in microcompartment organization.","Many autotrophic bacteria rely on Rubisco for carbon dioxide fixation.

674,Predicting response to immunotherapy in gastric cancer via multi-dimensional analyses of the tumour immune microenvironment,"A single biomarker is not adequate to identify patients with gastric cancer (GC) who have the potential to benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, presumably owing to the complexity of the tumour microenvironment. The predictive value of tumour-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) has not been definitively established with regard to their density and spatial organisation. Here, multiplex immunohistochemistry is used to quantify in situ biomarkers at sub-cellular resolution in 80 patients with GC. To predict the response to immunotherapy, we establish a multi-dimensional TIIC signature by considering the density of CD4+FoxP3−PD-L1+, CD8+PD-1−LAG3−, and CD68+STING+ cells and the spatial organisation of CD8+PD-1+LAG3− T cells. The TIIC signature enables prediction of the response of patients with GC to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy and patient survival. Our findings demonstrate that a multi-dimensional TIIC signature may be relevant for the selection of patients who could benefit the most from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.",Predictive methods for gastric cancer to try and differentiate between potential treatment response are required. Here the authors use a multiplexed immunohistochemistry method to propose the proximity of tumour infiltrating immune cells as an indicator of likely therapeutic response.,2022-08-18
675,Structural basis for cannabinoid-induced potentiation of alpha1-glycine receptors in lipid nanodiscs,"Nociception and motor coordination are critically governed by glycine receptor (GlyR) function at inhibitory synapses. Consequentially, GlyRs are attractive targets in the management of chronic pain and in the treatment of several neurological disorders. High-resolution mechanistic details of GlyR function and its modulation are just emerging. While it has been known that cannabinoids such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent in marijuana, potentiate GlyR in the therapeutically relevant concentration range, the molecular mechanism underlying this effect is still not understood. Here, we present Cryo-EM structures of full-length GlyR reconstituted into lipid nanodisc in complex with THC under varying concentrations of glycine. The GlyR-THC complexes are captured in multiple conformational states that reveal the basis for THC-mediated potentiation, manifested as different extents of opening at the level of the channel pore. Taken together, these structural findings, combined with molecular dynamics simulations and functional analysis, provide insights into the potential THC binding site and the allosteric coupling to the channel pore.","Glycine receptors (GlyRs) mediate motor control and pain perception. Here, Kumar et al. present structures of GlyR bound to Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) using cryo-electron microscopy, providing insight into the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids.",2022-08-18
676,Heterogenous humoral and cellular immune responses with distinct trajectories post-SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population-based cohort,"To better understand the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity over time, a detailed evaluation of humoral and cellular responses is required. Here, we characterize anti-Spike (S) IgA and IgG in a representative population-based cohort of 431 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals up to 217 days after diagnosis, demonstrating that 85% develop and maintain anti-S responses. In a subsample of 64 participants, we further assess anti-Nucleocapsid (N) IgG, neutralizing antibody activity, and T cell responses to Membrane (M), N, and S proteins. In contrast to S-specific antibody responses, anti-N IgG levels decline substantially over time and neutralizing activity toward Delta and Omicron variants is low to non-existent within just weeks of Wildtype SARS-CoV-2 infection. Virus-specific T cells are detectable in most participants, albeit more variable than antibody responses. Cluster analyses of the co-evolution of antibody and T cell responses within individuals identify five distinct trajectories characterized by specific immune patterns and clinical factors. These findings demonstrate the relevant heterogeneity in humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 while also identifying consistent patterns where antibody and T cell responses may work in a compensatory manner to provide protection.",The persistence of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 after recovery from infection is an indicator for subsequent protection against infection. Here the authors follow recovered patients and measure antibody and T cell responses and find that these two parts of the immune response may have different longevity.,2022-08-18
677,Deep reaction network exploration at a heterogeneous catalytic interface,"Characterizing the reaction energies and barriers of reaction networks is central to catalyst development. However, heterogeneous catalytic surfaces pose several unique challenges to automatic reaction network characterization, including large sizes and open-ended reactant sets, that make ad hoc network construction the current state-of-the-art. Here, we show how automated network exploration algorithms can be adapted to the constraints of heterogeneous systems using ethylene oligomerization on silica-supported single-site Ga3+ as a model system. Using only graph-based rules for exploring the network and elementary constraints based on activation energy and size for identifying network terminations, a comprehensive reaction network is generated and validated against standard methods. The algorithm (re)discovers the Ga-alkyl-centered Cossee-Arlman mechanism that is hypothesized to drive major product formation while also predicting several new pathways for producing alkanes and coke precursors. These results demonstrate that automated reaction exploration algorithms are rapidly maturing towards general purpose capability for exploratory catalytic applications.","This study demonstrates how reaction network characterization can be performed on heterogeneous catalytic surfaces predictively, rather than retrospectively, using automated exploration algorithms on an ethylene oligomerization exemplar reaction.",2022-08-18
678,Structural evolution and strain generation of derived-Cu catalysts during CO2 electroreduction,"Copper (Cu)-based catalysts generally exhibit high C2+ selectivity during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the origin of this selectivity and the influence of catalyst precursors on it are not fully understood. We combine operando X-ray diffraction and operando Raman spectroscopy to monitor the structural and compositional evolution of three Cu precursors during the CO2RR. The results indicate that despite different kinetics, all three precursors are completely reduced to Cu(0) with similar grain sizes (~11 nm), and that oxidized Cu species are not involved in the CO2RR. Furthermore, Cu(OH)2- and Cu2(OH)2CO3-derived Cu exhibit considerable tensile strain (0.43%~0.55%), whereas CuO-derived Cu does not. Theoretical calculations suggest that the tensile strain in Cu lattice is conducive to promoting CO2RR, which is consistent with experimental observations. The high CO2RR performance of some derived Cu catalysts is attributed to the combined effect of the small grain size and lattice strain, both originating from the in situ electroreduction of precursors. These findings establish correlations between Cu precursors, lattice strains, and catalytic behaviors, demonstrating the unique ability of operando characterization in studying electrochemical processes.","Copper catalysts derived from oxidized precursors typically exhibit high selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products, yet the influencing factors that control the selectivity need further investigation. Here, the authors reveal that the high selectivity stems from small grain size and lattice strain due to in situ reduction of precursors.",2022-08-18
679,Chemical zymogens for the protein cysteinome,"We present three classes of chemical zymogens established around the protein cysteinome. In each case, the cysteine thiol group was converted into a mixed disulfide: with a small molecule, a non-degradable polymer, or with a fast-depolymerizing fuse polymer (ZLA). The latter was a polydisulfide based on naturally occurring molecule, lipoic acid. Zymogen designs were applied to cysteine proteases and a kinase. In each case, enzymatic activity was successfully masked in full and reactivated by small molecule reducing agents. However, only ZLA could be reactivated by protein activators, demonstrating that the macromolecular fuse escapes the steric bulk created by the protein globule, collects activation signal in solution, and relays it to the active site of the enzyme. This afforded first-in-class chemical zymogens that are activated via protein-protein interactions. We also document zymogen exchange reactions whereby the polydisulfide is transferred between the interacting proteins via the “chain transfer” bioconjugation mechanism.",Reversible on/off switches for enzyme activity are foundational in nature but are challenging to design using tools of synthetic chemistry. Here the authors design chemical zymogens amenable for activation via biomolecular interactions.,2022-08-18
680,SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: spike protein mutational analysis and epitope for broad neutralization,"Mutations in the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have independently been shown to enhance aspects of spike protein fitness. Here, we describe an antibody fragment (VH ab6) that neutralizes all major variants including the recently emerged BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron subvariants, with a unique mode of binding revealed by cryo-EM studies. Further, we provide a comparative analysis of the mutational effects within previously emerged variant spikes and identify the structural role of mutations within the NTD and RBD in evading antibody neutralization. Our analysis shows that the highly mutated Gamma N-terminal domain exhibits considerable structural rearrangements, partially explaining its decreased neutralization by convalescent sera. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the structural, functional, and antigenic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations and highlight a spike protein vulnerability that may be exploited to achieve broad protection against circulating variants.","SARS-CoV-2 variants have accumulated multiple defining mutations within their spike glycoproteins. Here, the authors report a structural basis for broad neutralization of several variants by a heavy chain antibody fragment and provide a mutational analysis focusing on antibody evasion, receptor engagement, and spike protein structure.",2022-08-18
681,"Phase-locked constructing dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive elastomers with superior toughness, autonomous self-healing and recyclability","Stretchable ionic conductors are considerable to be the most attractive candidate for next-generation flexible ionotronic devices. Nevertheless, high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, good self-healing capacity and recyclability are necessary but can be rarely satisfied in one material. Herein, we propose an ionic conductor design, dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive elastomers (DSICE), via phase-locked strategy, wherein locking soft phase polyether backbone conducts lithium-ion (Li+) transport and the combination of dynamic disulfide metathesis and stronger supramolecular quadruple hydrogen bonds in the hard domains contributes to the self-healing capacity and mechanical versatility. The dual-phase design performs its own functions and the conflict among ionic conductivity, self-healing capability, and mechanical compatibility can be thus defeated. The well-designed DSICE exhibits high ionic conductivity (3.77 × 10−3 S m−1 at 30 °C), high transparency (92.3%), superior stretchability (2615.17% elongation), strength (27.83 MPa) and toughness (164.36 MJ m−3), excellent self-healing capability (~99% at room temperature) and favorable recyclability. This work provides an interesting strategy for designing the advanced ionic conductors and offers promise for flexible ionotronic devices or solid-state batteries.","Stretchable ionic conductors are attractive candidates for flexible ionotronics but combining high conductivity with excellent mechanical properties is challenging. Herein, the authors combine these properties in a dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive elastomer enabling lithium-ion transport in the soft phase and dynamic disulfide and supramolecular hydrogen bonding in the hard segments.",2022-08-18
682,Multiscale light-sheet organoid imaging framework,"Organoids provide an accessible in vitro system to mimic the dynamics of tissue regeneration and development. However, long-term live-imaging of organoids remains challenging. Here we present an experimental and image-processing framework capable of turning long-term light-sheet imaging of intestinal organoids into digital organoids. The framework combines specific imaging optimization combined with data processing via deep learning techniques to segment single organoids, their lumen, cells and nuclei in 3D over long periods of time. By linking lineage trees with corresponding 3D segmentation meshes for each organoid, the extracted information is visualized using a web-based “Digital Organoid Viewer” tool allowing combined understanding of the multivariate and multiscale data. We also show backtracking of cells of interest, providing detailed information about their history within entire organoid contexts. Furthermore, we show cytokinesis failure of regenerative cells and that these cells never reside in the intestinal crypt, hinting at a tissue scale control on cellular fidelity.",Live imaging of organoid growth remains a challenge: it requires long-term imaging of several samples simultaneously and dedicated analysis pipelines. Here the authors report an experimental and image processing framework to turn long-term light-sheet imaging of intestinal organoids into digital organoids.,2022-08-18
683,On maternity and the stronger immune response in women,"Medical research reports that women often exhibit stronger immune responses than men, while pathogens tend to be more virulent in men. Current explanations cannot account for this pattern, creating an obstacle for our understanding of infectious-disease outcomes and the incidence of autoimmune diseases. We offer an alternative explanation that relies on a fundamental difference between the sexes: maternity and the opportunities it creates for transmission of pathogens from mother to child (vertical transmission). Our explanation relies on a mathematical model of the co-evolution of host immunocompetence and pathogen virulence. Here, we show that when there is sufficient vertical transmission co-evolution leads women to defend strongly against temperate pathogens and men to defend weakly against aggressive pathogens, in keeping with medical observations. From a more applied perspective, we argue that limiting vertical transmission of infections would alleviate the disproportionate incidence of autoimmune diseases in women over evolutionary time.","Women generally mount a stronger immune response to infections than men do, resulting in a higher impact of autoimmune diseases. Here, the authors show that pathogen transmission from mother-to-child during pregnancy drives the co-evolution of a stout defence against harmless pathogens in women.",2022-08-18
684,Oral administration of Blautia wexlerae ameliorates obesity and type 2 diabetes via metabolic remodeling of the gut microbiota,"The gut microbiome is an important determinant in various diseases. Here we perform a cross-sectional study of Japanese adults and identify the Blautia genus, especially B. wexlerae, as a commensal bacterium that is inversely correlated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Oral administration of B. wexlerae to mice induce metabolic changes and anti-inflammatory effects that decrease both high-fat diet–induced obesity and diabetes. The beneficial effects of B. wexlerae are correlated with unique amino-acid metabolism to produce S-adenosylmethionine, acetylcholine, and l-ornithine and carbohydrate metabolism resulting in the accumulation of amylopectin and production of succinate, lactate, and acetate, with simultaneous modification of the gut bacterial composition. These findings reveal unique regulatory pathways of host and microbial metabolism that may provide novel strategies in preventive and therapeutic approaches for metabolic disorders.","Here, the authors inversely associate Blautia wexlerae with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans and further show that administration of B. wexlerae to mice decrease both high-fat diet–induced obesity and diabetes via modulating gut microbial metabolism.",2022-08-18
685,Engineering an autonomous VH domain to modulate intracellular pathways and to interrogate the eIF4F complex,"An attractive approach to target intracellular macromolecular interfaces and to model putative drug interactions is to design small high-affinity proteins. Variable domains of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH domains) are ideal miniproteins, but their development has been restricted by poor intracellular stability and expression. Here we show that an autonomous and disufhide-free VH domain is suitable for intracellular studies and use it to construct a high-diversity phage display library. Using this library and affinity maturation techniques we identify VH domains with picomolar affinity against eIF4E, a protein commonly hyper-activated in cancer. We demonstrate that these molecules interact with eIF4E at the eIF4G binding site via a distinct structural pose. Intracellular overexpression of these miniproteins reduce cellular proliferation and expression of malignancy-related proteins in cancer cell lines. The linkage of high-diversity in vitro libraries with an intracellularly expressible miniprotein scaffold will facilitate the discovery of VH domains suitable for intracellular applications.","Approaches have been devised to increase the discovery rate of intrabodies but often these yield results that aren’t functional in cells. Here the authors engineer and optimise an autonomous and disulphide-free human VH domain for intracellular expression, and they identify several VH domain binders against eIF4E.",2022-08-18
686,SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and breakthrough infections in the Virus Watch cohort,"A range of studies globally demonstrate that the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines wane over time, but the total effect of anti-S antibody levels on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether this varies by vaccine type is not well understood. Here we show that anti-S levels peak three to four weeks following the second dose of vaccine and the geometric mean of the samples is nine fold higher for BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1. Increasing anti-S levels are associated with a reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Hazard Ratio 0.85; 95%CIs: 0.79-0.92). We do not find evidence that this antibody relationship with risk of infection varies by second dose vaccine type (BNT162b2 vs. ChAdOx1). In keeping with our anti-S antibody data, we find that people vaccinated with ChAdOx1 had 1.64 times the odds (95% confidence interval 1.45-1.85) of a breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2. We anticipate our findings to be useful in the estimation of the protective effect of anti-S levels on risk of infection due to Delta. Our findings provide evidence about the relationship between antibody levels and protection for different vaccines and will support decisions on optimising the timing of booster vaccinations and identifying individuals who should be prioritised for booster vaccination, including those who are older, clinically extremely vulnerable, or received ChAdOx1 as their primary course. Our finding that risk of infection by anti-S level does not interact with vaccine type, but that individuals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 were at higher risk of infection, provides additional support for the use of using anti-S levels for estimating vaccine efficacy.","Here the authors provide data from a sub-cohort of the Virus Watch study (19,556 adults) who completed at-home capillary blood sampling on a monthly basis and describe an association between anti-spike antibody levels and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2022-08-18
687,BNT162b2-boosted immune responses six months after heterologous or homologous ChAdOx1nCoV-19/BNT162b2 vaccination against COVID-19,"Heterologous prime/boost vaccination with a vector-based approach (ChAdOx-1nCov-19, ChAd) followed by an mRNA vaccine (e.g. BNT162b2, BNT) has been reported to be superior in inducing protective immunity compared to repeated application of the same vaccine. However, data comparing immunity decline after homologous and heterologous vaccination as well as effects of a third vaccine application after heterologous ChAd/BNT vaccination are lacking. Here we show longitudinal monitoring of ChAd/ChAd (n = 41) and ChAd/BNT (n = 88) vaccinated individuals and the impact of a third vaccination with BNT. The third vaccination greatly augments waning anti-spike IgG but results in only moderate increase in spike-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell numbers in both groups, compared to cell frequencies already present after the second vaccination in the ChAd/BNT group. More importantly, the third vaccination efficiently restores neutralizing antibody responses against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants of the virus, but neutralizing activity against the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant remains severely impaired. In summary, inferior SARS-CoV-2 specific immune responses following homologous ChAd/ChAd vaccination can be compensated by heterologous BNT vaccination, which might influence the choice of vaccine type for subsequent vaccination boosts.","Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have changed the course of the COVID-19 pandemics, but waning immunity necessitates repeated immunization. Authors here show that immunity declines faster following two doses of vector-based vaccine compared to a first dose of vector-based vaccine followed by boosting with an mRNA vaccine, but application of an mRNA vaccine as a third dose minimises the difference between the two groups.",2022-08-18
688,Cross-tissue analysis of blood and brain epigenome-wide association studies in Alzheimer’s disease,"To better understand DNA methylation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from both mechanistic and biomarker perspectives, we performed an epigenome-wide meta-analysis of blood DNA methylation in two large independent blood-based studies in AD, the ADNI and AIBL studies, and identified 5 CpGs, mapped to the SPIDR, CDH6 genes, and intergenic regions, that are significantly associated with AD diagnosis. A cross-tissue analysis that combined these blood DNA methylation datasets with four brain methylation datasets prioritized 97 CpGs and 10 genomic regions that are significantly associated with both AD neuropathology and AD diagnosis. An out-of-sample validation using the AddNeuroMed dataset showed the best performing logistic regression model includes age, sex, immune cell type proportions, and methylation risk score based on prioritized CpGs in cross-tissue analysis (AUC = 0.696, 95% CI: 0.616 − 0.770, P-value = 2.78 × 10−5). Our study offers new insights into epigenetics in AD and provides a valuable resource for future AD biomarker discovery.","DNA methylation differences in Alzheimer’s disease have been previously reported, although the interpretation of the differences is unclear. Here, the authors performed epigenome-wide meta-analyses of DNA methylation in blood and brain, and developed a methylation-based risk prediction model for AD.",2022-08-18
689,Direct control of lysosomal catabolic activity by mTORC1 through regulation of V-ATPase assembly,"Mammalian cells can acquire exogenous amino acids through endocytosis and lysosomal catabolism of extracellular proteins. In amino acid-replete environments, nutritional utilization of extracellular proteins is suppressed by the amino acid sensor mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) through an unknown process. Here, we show that mTORC1 blocks lysosomal degradation of extracellular proteins by suppressing V-ATPase-mediated acidification of lysosomes. When mTORC1 is active, peripheral V-ATPase V1 domains reside in the cytosol where they are stabilized by association with the chaperonin TRiC. Consequently, most lysosomes display low catabolic activity. When mTORC1 activity declines, V-ATPase V1 domains move to membrane-integral V-ATPase Vo domains at lysosomes to assemble active proton pumps. The resulting drop in luminal pH increases protease activity and degradation of protein contents throughout the lysosomal population. These results uncover a principle by which cells rapidly respond to changes in their nutrient environment by mobilizing the latent catabolic capacity of lysosomes.","mTORC1 blocks lysosomal nutrient generation. Here, the authors show that mTORC1 inactivation triggers V-ATPase assembly, which rapidly initiates lysosomal acidification and degradation of protein contents throughout the lysosomal population.",2022-08-17
690,Planktonic foraminifera organic carbon isotopes as archives of upper ocean carbon cycling,"The carbon cycle is a key regulator of Earth’s climate. On geological time-scales, our understanding of particulate organic matter (POM), an important upper ocean carbon pool that fuels ecosystems and an integrated part of the carbon cycle, is limited. Here we investigate the relationship of planktonic foraminifera-bound organic carbon isotopes (δ13Corg-pforam) with δ13Corg of POM (δ13Corg-POM). We compare δ13Corg-pforam of several planktonic foraminifera species from plankton nets and recent sediment cores with δ13Corg-POM on a N-S Atlantic Ocean transect. Our results indicate that δ13Corg-pforam of planktonic foraminifera are remarkably similar to δ13Corg-POM. Application of our method on a glacial sample furthermore provided a δ13Corg-pforam value similar to glacial δ13Corg-POM predictions. We thus show that δ13Corg-pforam is a promising proxy to reconstruct environmental conditions in the upper ocean, providing a route to isolate past variations in δ13Corg-POM and better understanding of the evolution of the carbon cycle over geological time-scales.","Our understanding of ancient organic carbon cycling in marine environments is limited. Here the authors developed a method to reconstruct upper ocean organic carbon chemistry in the geological past, which when applied, can help to create a better understanding of the evolution of the carbon cycle.",2022-08-17
691,Emergent hypernetworks in weakly coupled oscillators,"Networks of weakly coupled oscillators had a profound impact on our understanding of complex systems. Studies on model reconstruction from data have shown prevalent contributions from hypernetworks with triplet and higher interactions among oscillators, in spite that such models were originally defined as oscillator networks with pairwise interactions. Here, we show that hypernetworks can spontaneously emerge even in the presence of pairwise albeit nonlinear coupling given certain triplet frequency resonance conditions. The results are demonstrated in experiments with electrochemical oscillators and in simulations with integrate-and-fire neurons. By developing a comprehensive theory, we uncover the mechanism for emergent hypernetworks by identifying appearing and forbidden frequency resonant conditions. Furthermore, it is shown that microscopic linear (difference) coupling among units results in coupled mean fields, which have sufficient nonlinearity to facilitate hypernetworks. Our findings shed light on the apparent abundance of hypernetworks and provide a constructive way to predict and engineer their emergence.","Networks with higher-order interactions are relevant to variety of real-world applications, they can be good description of data even if the system has only pairwise interactions. The authors uncover the hypernetwork emergence in coupled nonlinear oscillators and electrochemical experiments.",2022-08-17
692,Structural basis for proton coupled cystine transport by cystinosin,"Amino acid transporters play a key role controlling the flow of nutrients across the lysosomal membrane and regulating metabolism in the cell. Mutations in the gene encoding the transporter cystinosin result in cystinosis, an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterised by the accumulation of cystine crystals in the lysosome. Cystinosin is a member of the PQ-loop family of solute carrier (SLC) transporters and uses the proton gradient to drive cystine export into the cytoplasm. However, the molecular basis for cystinosin function remains elusive, hampering efforts to develop novel treatments for cystinosis and understand the mechanisms of ion driven transport in the PQ-loop family. To address these questions, we present the crystal structures of cystinosin from Arabidopsis thaliana in both apo and cystine bound states. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo based assays, we establish a mechanism for cystine recognition and proton coupled transport. Mutational mapping and functional characterisation of human cystinosin further provide a framework for understanding the molecular impact of disease-causing mutations.","Mutations in CTNS, the lysosomal cystine-proton symporter, cause cystinosis. Here authors report crystal structures of CTNS from Arabidopsis thaliana in complex with cystine, and establish the mode of ligand recognition and mechanism for proton-coupled cystine export from the lysosome.",2022-08-17
693,AAA + ATPase Thorase inhibits mTOR signaling through the disassembly of the mTOR complex 1,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signals through the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and the mTOR complex 2 to maintain cellular and organismal homeostasis. Failure to finely tune mTOR activity results in metabolic dysregulation and disease. While there is substantial understanding of the molecular events leading mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, remarkably little is known about what terminates mTORC1 signaling. Here, we show that the AAA + ATPase Thorase directly binds mTOR, thereby orchestrating the disassembly and inactivation of mTORC1. Thorase disrupts the association of mTOR to Raptor at the mitochondria-lysosome interface and this action is sensitive to amino acids. Lack of Thorase causes accumulation of mTOR-Raptor complexes and altered mTORC1 disassembly/re-assembly dynamics upon changes in amino acid availability. The resulting excessive mTORC1 can be counteracted with rapamycin in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, we reveal Thorase as a key component of the mTOR pathway that disassembles and thus inhibits mTORC1.",Signaling via the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) maintains cellular and organismal homeostasis. Here the authors show that the AAA + ATPase Thorase binds mTOR to promote disassembly and inactivation of mTORC1 to fine tune TOR signaling according to amino acid availability.,2022-08-17
694,GWAS meta-analysis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy implicates multiple hepatic genes and regulatory elements,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a pregnancy-specific liver disorder affecting 0.5–2% of pregnancies. The majority of cases present in the third trimester with pruritus, elevated serum bile acids and abnormal serum liver tests. ICP is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, including spontaneous preterm birth and stillbirth. Whilst rare mutations affecting hepatobiliary transporters contribute to the aetiology of ICP, the role of common genetic variation in ICP has not been systematically characterised to date. Here, we perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses for ICP across three studies including 1138 cases and 153,642 controls. Eleven loci achieve genome-wide significance and have been further investigated and fine-mapped using functional genomics approaches. Our results pinpoint common sequence variation in liver-enriched genes and liver-specific cis-regulatory elements as contributing mechanisms to ICP susceptibility.","Investigation of variation in three cohorts has identified multiple genetic signals associated with the pregnancy-specific liver disorder, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, giving insight into the disease which can cause preterm birth and stillbirth.",2022-08-17
695,Terrigenous dissolved organic matter persists in the energy-limited deep groundwaters of the Fennoscandian Shield,"The deep terrestrial biosphere encompasses the life below the photosynthesis-fueled surface that perseveres in typically nutrient and energy depleted anoxic groundwaters. The composition and cycling of this vast dissolved organic matter (DOM) reservoir relevant to the global carbon cycle remains to be deciphered. Here we show that recent Baltic Sea-influenced to ancient pre-Holocene saline Fennoscandian Shield deep bedrock fracture waters carried DOM with a strong terrigenous signature and varying contributions from abiotic and biotic processes. Removal of easily degraded carbon at the surface-to-groundwater transition and corresponding microbial community assembly processes likely resulted in the highly similar DOM signatures across the notably different water types that selected for a core microbiome. In combination with the aliphatic character, depleted δ13C signatures in DOM indicated recent microbial production in the oldest, saline groundwater. Our study revealed the persistence of terrestrially-sourced carbon in severely energy limited deep continental groundwaters supporting deep microbial life.","Dissolved organic matter in the Fennoscandian Shield deep continental bedrock fracture waters of varying characteristics and ages carries a strong terrigenous signature, and only a small proportion of this potential energy source links to the deep biosphere microbial community.",2022-08-17
696,MARTX toxin of Vibrio vulnificus induces RBC phosphatidylserine exposure that can contribute to thrombosis,"V. vulnificus-infected patients suffer from hemolytic anemia and circulatory lesions, often accompanied by venous thrombosis. However, the pathophysiological mechanism of venous thrombosis associated with V. vulnificus infection remains largely unknown. Herein, V. vulnificus infection at the sub-hemolytic level induced shape change of human red blood cells (RBCs) accompanied by phosphatidylserine exposure, and microvesicle generation, leading to the procoagulant activation of RBCs and ultimately, acquisition of prothrombotic activity. Of note, V. vulnificus exposed to RBCs substantially upregulated the rtxA gene encoding multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) toxin. Mutant studies showed that V. vulnificus-induced RBC procoagulant activity was due to the pore forming region of the MARTX toxin causing intracellular Ca2+ influx in RBCs. In a rat venous thrombosis model triggered by tissue factor and stasis, the V. vulnificus wild type increased thrombosis while the ΔrtxA mutant failed to increase thrombosis, confirming that V. vulnificus induces thrombosis through the procoagulant activation of RBCs via the mediation of the MARTX toxin.","The pathophysiological mechanism of venous thrombosis associated with Vibrio vulnificus infection remains largely unknown. In this work, the authors investigate this association, focusing on effects of the pore-forming MARTX toxin of V. vulnificus on red blood cells, and the utilisation of a rat venous thrombosis model.",2022-08-17
697,Halogenation of tyrosine perturbs large-scale protein self-organization,"Protein halogenation is a common non-enzymatic post-translational modification contributing to aging, oxidative stress-related diseases and cancer. Here, we report a genetically encodable halogenation of tyrosine residues in a reconstituted prokaryotic filamentous cell-division protein (FtsZ) as a platform to elucidate the implications of halogenation that can be extrapolated to living systems of much higher complexity. We show how single halogenations can fine-tune protein structures and dynamics of FtsZ with subtle perturbations collectively amplified by the process of FtsZ self-organization. Based on experiments and theories, we have gained valuable insights into the mechanism of halogen influence. The bending of FtsZ structures occurs by affecting surface charges and internal domain distances and is reflected in the decline of GTPase activities by reducing GTP binding energy during polymerization. Our results point to a better understanding of the physiological and pathological effects of protein halogenation and may contribute to the development of potential diagnostic tools.",Sun et al. has studied the genetically encodable halotyrosines in proteins of the prokaryotic cell division machinery to elucidate the general role of halogenation in cellular lifespan and oxidative damage-induced diseases such as aging and cancer.,2022-08-17
698,Mechanistic classification and benchmarking of polyolefin depolymerization over silica-alumina-based catalysts,"Carbon-carbon bond cleavage mechanisms play a key role in the selective deconstruction of alkanes and polyolefins. Here, we show that the product distribution, which encompasses carbon range and formation of unsaturated and isomerization products, serves as a distinctive feature that allows the reaction pathways of different catalysts to be classified. Co, Ni, or Ru nanoparticles immobilized on amorphous silica-alumina, Zeo-Y and ZSM-5, were evaluated as catalysts in the deconstruction of n-hexadecane model substrate with hydrogen to delineate between different mechanisms, i.e., monofunctional- (acid site dominated) or bifunctional-hydrocracking (acid site & metal site) versus hydrogenolysis (metal site dominated), established from the product distributions. The ZSM-5-based catalysts were further studied in the depolymerization of polyethylene. Based on these studies, the catalysts are plotted on an activity-mechanism map that functions as an expandable basis to benchmark catalytic activity and to identify optimal catalysts that afford specific product distributions. The systematic approach reported here should facilitate the acceleration of catalyst discovery for polyolefin depolymerization.",Product distributions have been used to classify the depolymerization pathways of polyolefins catalyzed by silica-alumina-based catalysts to construct an activity-mechanism map as a benchmarking tool to facilitate catalyst discovery.,2022-08-17
699,Promotion of neutralizing antibody-independent immunity to wild-type and SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern using an RBD-Nucleocapsid fusion protein,"Both T cells and B cells have been shown to be generated after infection with SARS-CoV-2 yet protocols or experimental models to study one or the other are less common. Here, we generate a chimeric protein (SpiN) that comprises the receptor binding domain (RBD) from Spike (S) and the nucleocapsid (N) antigens from SARS-CoV-2. Memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for SpiN could be detected in the blood of both individuals vaccinated with Coronavac SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and COVID-19 convalescent donors. In mice, SpiN elicited a strong IFN-γ response by T cells and high levels of antibodies to the inactivated virus, but not detectable neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Importantly, immunization of Syrian hamsters and the human Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme-2-transgenic (K18-ACE-2) mice with Poly ICLC-adjuvanted SpiN promotes robust resistance to the wild type SARS-CoV-2, as indicated by viral load, lung inflammation, clinical outcome and reduction of lethality. The protection induced by SpiN was ablated by depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and not transferred by antibodies from vaccinated mice. Finally, vaccination with SpiN also protects the K18-ACE-2 mice against infection with Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Hence, vaccine formulations that elicit effector T cells specific for the N and RBD proteins may be used to improve COVID-19 vaccines and potentially circumvent the immune escape by variants of concern.",Protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection involves T cell and B cell responses but only studying one or the other has proved difficult. Here the authors immunise with a fusion protein construct of N and RBD proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and find that this promotes protection in animal models preferentially via T cells.,2022-08-17
700,High impact of bacterial predation on cyanobacteria in soil biocrusts,"Diverse bacteria lead a life as pathogens or predators of other bacteria in many environments. However, their impact on emerging ecological processes in natural settings remains to be assessed. Here we describe a novel type of obligate, intracellular predatory bacterium of widespread distribution that preys on soil cyanobacteria in biocrusts. The predator, Candidatus Cyanoraptor togatus, causes localized, cm-sized epidemics that are visible to the naked eye, obliterates cyanobacterial net primary productivity, and severely impacts crucial biocrust properties like nitrogen cycling, dust trapping and moisture retention. The combined effects of high localized morbidity and areal incidence result in decreases approaching 10% of biocrust productivity at the ecosystem scale. Our findings show that bacterial predation can be an important loss factor shaping not only the structure but also the function of microbial communities.","Some bacteria act as pathogens or predators of other bacteria, but their impact in natural settings is often unclear. Here, Bethany et al. describe a new type of obligate, intracellular predatory bacterium of widespread distribution that preys on soil cyanobacteria in biocrusts and thus severely impacts biocrust productivity.",2022-08-17
701,A nanoengineered topical transmucosal cisplatin delivery system induces anti-tumor response in animal models and patients with oral cancer,"Despite therapeutic advancements, oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) remains a difficult disease to treat. Systemic platinum-based chemotherapy often leads to dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), affecting quality of life. PRV111 is a nanotechnology-based system for local delivery of cisplatin loaded chitosan particles, that penetrate tumor tissue and lymphatic channels while avoiding systemic circulation and toxicity. Here we evaluate PRV111 using animal models of oral cancer, followed by a clinical trial in patients with OCSCC. In vivo, PRV111 results in elevated cisplatin retention in tumors and negligible systemic levels, compared to the intravenous, intraperitoneal or intratumoral delivery. Furthermore, PRV111 produces robust anti-tumor responses in subcutaneous and orthotopic cancer models and results in complete regression of carcinogen-induced premalignant lesions. In a phase 1/2, open-label, single-arm trial (NCT03502148), primary endpoints of efficacy (≥30% tumor volume reduction) and safety (incidence of DLTs) of neoadjuvant PRV111 were reached, with 69% tumor reduction in ~7 days and over 87% response rate. Secondary endpoints (cisplatin biodistribution, loco-regional control, and technical success) were achieved. No DLTs or drug-related serious adverse events were reported. No locoregional recurrences were evident in 6 months. Integration of PRV111 with current standard of care may improve health outcomes and survival of patients with OCSCC.","Cisplatin is the most frequently used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC), however, systemic administration is often associated with dose limiting side effects. Here the authors design and test a nano-engineered patch system (PRV111) for the local delivery of cisplatin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles and report the results of a phase 1/2 clinical trial of PRV111 in patients with OCSCC.",2022-08-17
702,A lymphatic-absorbed multi-targeted kinase inhibitor for myelofibrosis therapy,"Activation of compensatory signaling nodes in cancer often requires combination therapies that are frequently plagued by dose-limiting toxicities. Intestinal lymphatic drug absorption is seldom explored, although reduced toxicity and sustained drug levels would be anticipated to improve systemic bioavailability. A potent orally bioavailable multi-functional kinase inhibitor (LP-182) is described with intrinsic lymphatic partitioning for the combined targeting of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways without observable toxicity. We demonstrate selectivity and therapeutic efficacy through reduction of downstream kinase activation, amelioration of disease phenotypes, and improved survival in animal models of myelofibrosis. Our further characterization of synthetic and physiochemical properties for small molecule lymphatic uptake will support continued advancements in lymphatropic therapy for altering disease trajectories of a myriad of human disease indications.","Combination therapies simultaneously inhibiting different therapeutic targets in cancer is challenged by individual pharmacokinetic profiles. Here, the authors generate an orally provided multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that is lymphatic absorbed and increases survival in a murine model of myelofibrosis.",2022-08-17
703,Experimental exploration of a ribozyme neutral network using evolutionary algorithm and deep learning,"A neutral network connects all genotypes with equivalent phenotypes in a fitness landscape and plays an important role in the mutational robustness and evolvability of biomolecules. In contrast to earlier theoretical works, evidence of large neutral networks has been lacking in recent experimental studies of fitness landscapes. This suggests that evolution could be constrained globally. Here, we demonstrate that a deep learning-guided evolutionary algorithm can efficiently identify neutral genotypes within the sequence space of an RNA ligase ribozyme. Furthermore, we measure the activities of all 216 variants connecting two active ribozymes that differ by 16 mutations and analyze mutational interactions (epistasis) up to the 16th order. We discover an extensive network of neutral paths linking the two genotypes and reveal that these paths might be predicted using only information from lower-order interactions. Our experimental evaluation of over 120,000 ribozyme sequences provides important empirical evidence that neutral networks can increase the accessibility and predictability of the fitness landscape.","Neutral networks, which are sets of genotypes connected via single mutations that share the same phenotype, are important for evolvability. Here, the authors provide experimental evidence of a neutral network in an RNA enzyme using a high-throughput assay and deep learning.",2022-08-17
704,"Trends in COVID-19 hospital outcomes in England before and after vaccine introduction, a cohort study","Widespread vaccination campaigns have changed the landscape for COVID-19, vastly altering symptoms and reducing morbidity and mortality. We estimate trends in mortality by month of admission and vaccination status among those hospitalised with COVID-19 in England between March 2020 to September 2021, controlling for demographic factors and hospital load. Among 259,727 hospitalised COVID-19 cases, 51,948 (20.0%) experienced mortality in hospital. Hospitalised fatality risk ranged from 40.3% (95% confidence interval 39.4–41.3%) in March 2020 to 8.1% (7.2–9.0%) in June 2021. Older individuals and those with multiple co-morbidities were more likely to die or else experienced longer stays prior to discharge. Compared to unvaccinated people, the hazard of hospitalised mortality was 0.71 (0.67–0.77) with a first vaccine dose, and 0.56 (0.52–0.61) with a second vaccine dose. Compared to hospital load at 0–20% of the busiest week, the hazard of hospitalised mortality during periods of peak load (90–100%), was 1.23 (1.12–1.34). The prognosis for people hospitalised with COVID-19 in England has varied substantially throughout the pandemic and according to case-mix, vaccination, and hospital load. Our estimates provide an indication for demands on hospital resources, and the relationship between hospital burden and outcomes.","This study investigates trends in mortality and length of stay for people hospitalised with COVID-19 in England until September 2021. It shows that risks were higher for unvaccinated people and those with multiple comorbidities, and that busier hospitals had higher mortality rates at the start of the pandemic but this effect lessened over time.",2022-08-17
705,Cryo-EM structures of the channelrhodopsin ChRmine in lipid nanodiscs,"Microbial channelrhodopsins are light-gated ion channels widely used for optogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity. ChRmine is a bacteriorhodopsin-like cation channelrhodopsin (BCCR) more closely related to ion pump rhodopsins than other channelrhodopsins. ChRmine displays unique properties favorable for optogenetics including high light sensitivity, a broad, red-shifted activation spectrum, cation selectivity, and large photocurrents, while its slow closing kinetics impedes some applications. The structural basis for ChRmine function, or that of any other BCCR, is unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of ChRmine in lipid nanodiscs in apo (opsin) and retinal-bound (rhodopsin) forms. The structures reveal an unprecedented trimeric architecture with a lipid filled central pore. Large electronegative cavities on either side of the membrane facilitate high conductance and selectivity for cations over protons. The retinal binding pocket structure suggests channel properties could be tuned with mutations and we identify ChRmine variants with ten-fold decreased and two-fold increased closing rates. A T119A mutant shows favorable properties relative to wild-type and previously reported ChRmine variants for optogenetics. These results provide insight into structural features that generate an ultra-potent microbial opsin and provide a platform for rational engineering of channelrhodopsins with improved properties that could expand the scale, depth, and precision of optogenetic experiments.","ChRmine is a bacteriorhodopsin-like cation channelrhodopsin (BCCR). Here, the authors present cryo-EM structures of ChRmine in apo- and retinal-bound forms to provide insight into channel activity in a BCCR and facilitate engineering of ChRmine-based optogenetic tools.",2022-08-17
706,The origin and evolution of open habitats in North America inferred by Bayesian deep learning models,"Some of the most extensive terrestrial biomes today consist of open vegetation, including temperate grasslands and tropical savannas. These biomes originated relatively recently in Earth’s history, likely replacing forested habitats in the second half of the Cenozoic. However, the timing of their origination and expansion remains disputed. Here, we present a Bayesian deep learning model that utilizes information from fossil evidence, geologic models, and paleoclimatic proxies to reconstruct paleovegetation, placing the emergence of open habitats in North America at around 23 million years ago. By the time of the onset of the Quaternary glacial cycles, open habitats were covering more than 30% of North America and were expanding at peak rates, to eventually become the most prominent natural vegetation type today. Our entirely data-driven approach demonstrates how deep learning can harness unexplored signals from complex data sets to provide insights into the evolution of Earth’s biomes in time and space.","The expansion timing and dynamics of open vegetation are disputed. Here, the authors present a model of paleovegetation changes in North America, showing open vegetation beginning around 23 million years ago and accelerating at 5 million years ago to become the most prominent natural vegetation type in North America today.",2022-08-17
707,Intrinsic cell rheology drives junction maturation,"A fundamental property of higher eukaryotes that underpins their evolutionary success is stable cell-cell cohesion. Yet, how intrinsic cell rheology and stiffness contributes to junction stabilization and maturation is poorly understood. We demonstrate that localized modulation of cell rheology governs the transition of a slack, undulated cell-cell contact (weak adhesion) to a mature, straight junction (optimal adhesion). Cell pairs confined on different geometries have heterogeneous elasticity maps and control their own intrinsic rheology co-ordinately. More compliant cell pairs grown on circles have slack contacts, while stiffer triangular cell pairs favour straight junctions with flanking contractile thin bundles. Counter-intuitively, straighter cell-cell contacts have reduced receptor density and less dynamic junctional actin, suggesting an unusual adaptive mechano-response to stabilize cell-cell adhesion. Our modelling informs that slack junctions arise from failure of circular cell pairs to increase their own intrinsic stiffness and resist the pressures from the neighbouring cell. The inability to form a straight junction can be reversed by increasing mechanical stress artificially on stiffer substrates. Our data inform on the minimal intrinsic rheology to generate a mature junction and provide a springboard towards understanding elements governing tissue-level mechanics.","How intrinsic cell properties such as stiffness contribute to cell-cell junction stabilization is not well described. Here they show that higher levels of intrinsic cell mechanics at the cortex, cytoskeleton and nucleus of neighboring cells promote junctional maturation.",2022-08-17
708,Synthesis of cis-thiiranes as diastereoselective access to epoxide congeners via 4π-electrocyclization of thiocarbonyl ylides,"Organochalcogen heterocycles are ubiquitously present and widely utilized in various fields. Among them, oxirane has been extensively studied, and all of the stereoisomeric forms are readily available. In contrast, synthetic studies on thiirane were rarely reported, and thus the useful sulfur-congener of oxirane has been difficult to access in a stereodefined form. In this research, a general stereoselective synthesis of cis-thiiranes is accomplished by taking advantage of stereospecific electrocyclization of trans-thiocarbonyl ylides, which are generated in situ from readily available E,E-aldazine N-oxides upon treatment with Lawesson’s reagent. This newly developed practical method provides a variety of cis−1,2-diarylthiiranes as essentially single diastereomers in high yields under mild reaction conditions. The intermediacy of trans-thiocarbonyl yilde is confirmed by mechanistic experiments, and the excellent stereocontrol is rationalized by DFT calculation.","Thiirane, the sulfur congener of oxirane, has been hard to access in a stereodefined form. Here, the authors accomplished a highly stereoselective synthesis of cis-diarylthiiranes through the stereospecific sulfurization of E,E-aldazine N-oxides.",2022-08-16
709,Widespread impact-generated porosity in early planetary crusts,"NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft revealed the crust of the Moon is highly porous, with ~4% porosity at 20 km deep. The deep lying porosity discovered by GRAIL has been difficult to explain, with most current models only able to explain high porosity near the lunar surface (first few kilometers) or inside complex craters. Using hydrocode routines we simulated fracturing and generation of porosity by large impacts in lunar, martian, and Earth crust. Our simulations indicate impacts that produce 100–1000 km scale basins alone are capable of producing all observed porosity within the lunar crust. Simulations under the higher surface gravity of Mars and Earth suggest basin forming impacts can be a primary source of porosity and fracturing of ancient planetary crusts. Thus, we show that impacts could have supported widespread crustal fluid circulation, with important implications for subsurface habitable environments on early Earth and Mars.","Large impacts can create deep lying porosity far away from the crater. This result explains GRAIL’s findings and suggests impacts could support widespread fluid circulation, which has implications for habitable environments on early Earth and Mars.",2022-08-16
710,Two-colour high-purity Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen photonic state,"We report a high-purity Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state between light modes with the wavelengths separated by more than 200 nm. We demonstrate highly efficient EPR-steering between the modes with the product of conditional variances \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{E}}}}}}}}}^{2}=0.11\pm 0.01\ll 1\). The modes display − 7.7 ± 0.5 dB of two-mode squeezing and an overall state purity of 0.63 ± 0.16. EPR-steering is observed over five octaves of sideband frequencies from RF down to audio-band. The demonstrated combination of high state purity, strong quantum correlations, and extended frequency range enables new matter-light quantum protocols.","Engineering quantum correlations between light modes at different frequency would open new avenues for quantum networks and sensing. Here, the authors propose and demonstrate a way for obtaining high-purity strongly entangled continuous variable states with more than 200 nm difference in wavelength.",2022-08-16
711,Single cell spatial analysis reveals the topology of immunomodulatory purinergic signaling in glioblastoma,"How the glioma immune microenvironment fosters tumorigenesis remains incompletely defined. Here, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplexed tissue-imaging to characterize the composition, spatial organization, and clinical significance of extracellular purinergic signaling in glioma. We show that microglia are the predominant source of CD39, while tumor cells principally express CD73. In glioblastoma, CD73 is associated with EGFR amplification, astrocyte-like differentiation, and increased adenosine, and is linked to hypoxia. Glioblastomas enriched for CD73 exhibit inflammatory microenvironments, suggesting that purinergic signaling regulates immune adaptation. Spatially-resolved single-cell analyses demonstrate a strong spatial correlation between tumor-CD73 and microglial-CD39, with proximity associated with poor outcomes. Similar spatial organization is present in pediatric high-grade gliomas including H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma. These data reveal that purinergic signaling in gliomas is shaped by genotype, lineage, and functional state, and that core enzymes expressed by tumor and myeloid cells are organized to promote adenosine-rich microenvironments potentially amenable to therapeutic targeting.","The components of the glioma immune microenvironment and their roles in promoting tumourigenesis remain poorly understood. Here, the use of single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplexed tissue-imaging in adult and pediatric high-grade gliomas reveals the activity and spatial organization of the immunomodulatory purinergic signaling pathway.",2022-08-16
712,A TrkB agonist prodrug prevents bone loss via inhibiting asparagine endopeptidase and increasing osteoprotegerin,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor (TrkB) are expressed in human osteoblasts and mediate fracture healing. BDNF/TrkB signaling activates Akt that phosphorylates and inhibits asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), which regulates the differentiation fate of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC) and is altered in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Here we show that R13, a small molecular TrkB receptor agonist prodrug, inhibits AEP and promotes bone formation. Though both receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANK-L) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) induced by ovariectomy (OVX) remain comparable between WT and BDNF+/− mice, R13 treatment significantly elevates OPG in both mice without altering RANKL, blocking trabecular bone loss. Strikingly, both R13 and anti-RANK-L exhibit equivalent therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, OVX increases RANK-L and OPG in WT and AEP KO mice with RANK-L/OPG ratio lower in the latter than the former, attenuating bone turnover. 7,8-DHF, released from R13, activates TrkB and its downstream effector CREB, which is critical for OPG augmentation. Consequently, 7,8-DHF represses C/EBPβ/AEP pathway, inhibiting RANK-L-induced RAW264.7 osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, our findings support that R13 exerts its therapeutic efficacy toward osteoporosis via inhibiting AEP and escalating OPG.",BDNS and TrkB are involved in bone fracture healing by inhibiting AEP. Here the authors show that a TrkB agonist prodrug can inhibit AEP and promote bone formation in osteoporotic mice.,2022-08-16
713,Hydrogen-bonded organic framework biomimetic entrapment allowing non-native biocatalytic activity in enzyme,"Nature programs the structural folding of an enzyme that allows its on-demand biofunctionality; however, it is still a long-standing challenge to manually modulate an enzyme’s conformation. Here, we design an exogenous hydrogen-bonded organic framework to modulate the conformation of cytochrome c, and hence allow non-native bioactivity for the enzyme. The rigid hydrogen-bonded organic framework, with net-arranged carboxylate inner cage, is in situ installed onto the native cytochrome c. The resultant hydrogen-bonded nano-biointerface changes the conformation to a previously not achieved catalase-like species within the reported cytochrome c-porous organic framework systems. In addition, the preserved hydrogen-bonded organic framework can stabilize the encapsulated enzyme and its channel-like pores also guarantee the free entrance of catalytic substrates. This work describes a conceptual nanotechnology for manoeuvring the flexible conformations of an enzyme, and also highlights the advantages of artificial hydrogen-bonded scaffolds to modulate enzyme activity.","Heme units are immobilised in diverse heme enzymes for oxidation, and have been immobilised also in hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks. Here, the authors show the use of hydrogen-bonded organic framework to modulate the enzyme’s conformation and show different biofunction from the original.",2022-08-16
714,Neural circuit for social authentication in song learning,"Social interactions are essential when learning to communicate. In human speech and bird song, infants must acquire accurate vocalization patterns and learn to associate them with live tutors and not mimetic sources. However, the neural mechanism of social reality during vocal learning remains unknown. Here, we characterize a neural circuit for social authentication in support of accurate song learning in the zebra finch. We recorded neural activity in the attention/arousal state control center, the locus coeruleus (LC), of juvenile birds during song learning from a live adult tutor. LC activity increased with real, not artificial, social information during learning that enhanced the precision and robustness of the learned song. During live social song learning, LC activity regulated long-term song-selective neural responsiveness in an auditory memory region, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM). In accord, optogenetic inhibition of LC presynaptic signaling in the NCM reduced NCM neuronal responsiveness to live tutor singing and impaired song learning. These results demonstrate that the LC-NCM neural circuit integrates sensory evidence of real social interactions, distinct from song acoustic features, to authenticate song learning. The findings suggest a general mechanism for validating social information in brain development.","Human and bird infants acquire vocal patterns from live, not mimetic, tutors. Here, the authors identified the neuronal circuits to authenticate social information in zebra finch song learning, suggesting a brain developmental mechanism via social interactions.",2022-08-16
715,The combination of genomic offset and niche modelling provides insights into climate change-driven vulnerability,"Global warming is increasingly exacerbating biodiversity loss. Populations locally adapted to spatially heterogeneous environments may respond differentially to climate change, but this intraspecific variation has only recently been considered when modelling vulnerability under climate change. Here, we incorporate intraspecific variation in genomic offset and ecological niche modelling to estimate climate change-driven vulnerability in two bird species in the Sino-Himalayan Mountains. We found that the cold-tolerant populations show higher genomic offset but risk less challenge for niche suitability decline under future climate than the warm-tolerant populations. Based on a genome-niche index estimated by combining genomic offset and niche suitability change, we identified the populations with the least genome-niche interruption as potential donors for evolutionary rescue, i.e., the populations tolerant to climate change. We evaluated potential rescue routes via a landscape genetic analysis. Overall, we demonstrate that the integration of genomic offset, niche suitability modelling, and landscape connectivity can improve climate change-driven vulnerability assessments and facilitate effective conservation management.","Species responses to climate change may be challenging to predict. Here, the authors demonstrate the value of combining genomics, niche modelling, and landscape connectivity to estimate population-level vulnerability under future climate scenarios in two bird species.",2022-08-16
716,Skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets and their nucleation via electrical current and ultra-fast laser illumination,"Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures that hold great promise as nanoscale information carriers in non-volatile memory and logic devices. While room-temperature magnetic skyrmions and their current-induced motion were recently demonstrated, the stray field resulting from their finite magnetisation and their topological charge limit their minimum size and reliable motion. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions allow to lift these limitations owing to their vanishing magnetisation and net zero topological charge, promising ultra-small and ultra-fast skyrmions. Here, we report on the observation of isolated skyrmions in compensated synthetic antiferromagnets at zero field and room temperature using X-ray magnetic microscopy. Micromagnetic simulations and an analytical model confirm the chiral antiferromagnetic nature of these skyrmions and allow the identification of the physical mechanisms controlling their size and stability. Finally, we demonstrate the nucleation of synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmions via local current injection and ultra-fast laser excitation.","Skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets are appealing for use in future memory and computing devices, combining small size and fast motion, but creating, stabilizing, and observing them remains a challenge. Here, Juge et al demonstrate the stabilization and current and light induced nucleation of skyrmions in a synthetic antiferromagnet, observing the magnetization texture in each layer using X-ray magnetic microscopy.",2022-08-16
717,Three-dimensional nanoframes with dual rims as nanoprobes for biosensing,"Three-dimensional (3D) nanoframe structures are very appealing because their inner voids and ridges interact efficiently with light and analytes, allowing for effective optical-based sensing. However, the realization of complex nanoframe architecture with high yield is challenging because the systematic design of such a complicated nanostructure lacks an appropriate synthesis protocol. Here, we show the synthesis method for complex 3D nanoframes wherein two-dimensional (2D) dual-rim nanostructures are engraved on each facet of octahedral nanoframes. The synthetic scheme proceeds through multiple executable on-demand steps. With Au octahedral nanoparticles as a sacrificial template, sequential processes of edge-selective Pt deposition and inner Au etching lead to Pt octahedral mono-rim nanoframes. Then, adlayers of Au are grown on Pt skeletons via the Frank-van der Merwe mode, forming sharp and well-developed edges. Next, Pt selective deposition on both the inner and outer boundaries leads to tunable geometric patterning on Au. Finally, after the selective etching of Au, Pt octahedral dual-rim nanoframes with highly homogeneous size and shape are achieved. In order to endow plasmonic features, Au is coated around Pt frames while retaining their geometric shape. The resultant plasmonic dual-rim engraved nanoframes possess strong light entrapping capability verified by single-particle surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and show the potential of nanoprobes for biosensing through SERS-based immunoassay.","Most SERS-active nanostructures suffer from low robustness against misalignment to field polarization. Here, the authors demonstrate three-dimensional nanoframes of octahedral geometry, with two rims engraved on each facet, as polarization-independent SERS nanoprobes.",2022-08-16
718,Understanding the lithium–sulfur battery redox reactions via operando confocal Raman microscopy,"The complex interplay and only partial understanding of the multi-step phase transitions and reaction kinetics of redox processes in lithium–sulfur batteries are the main stumbling blocks that hinder the advancement and broad deployment of this electrochemical energy storage system. To better understand these aspects, here we report operando confocal Raman microscopy measurements to investigate the reaction kinetics of Li–S redox processes and provide mechanistic insights into polysulfide generation/evolution and sulfur deposition. Operando visualization and quantification of the reactants and intermediates enabled the characterization of potential-dependent rates during Li–S redox and the linking of the electronic conductivity of the sulfur-based electrode and concentrations of polysulfides to the cell performance. We also report the visualization of the interfacial evolution and diffusion processes of different polysulfides that demonstrate stepwise discharge and parallel recharge mechanisms during cell operation. These results provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms and kinetics of Li–S redox reactions.","The complex redox processes in lithium–sulfur batteries are not yet fully understood at the fundamental level.

719,A functional role of meningeal lymphatics in sex difference of stress susceptibility in mice,"Major depressive disorder is one of the most common mental health conditions. Meningeal lymphatics are essential for drainage of molecules in the cerebrospinal fluid to the peripheral immune system. Their potential role in depression-like behaviour has not been investigated. Here, we show in mice, sub-chronic variable stress as a model of depression-like behaviour impairs meningeal lymphatics in females but not in males. Manipulations of meningeal lymphatics regulate the sex difference in the susceptibility to stress-induced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice, as well as alterations of the medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral tegmental area, brain regions critical for emotional regulation. Together, our findings suggest meningeal lymphatic impairment contributes to susceptibility to stress in mice, and that restoration of the meningeal lymphatics might have potential for modulation of depression-like behaviour.","The mechanisms underlying sex differences in response to stress are unclear. Here, the authors show that meningeal lymphatics dysfunction modulates the sex difference in the stress susceptibility to depression- and anxiety-like behaviours in mice.",2022-08-16
720,Mechanochemical synthesis of inverse vulcanized polymers,"Inverse vulcanization, a sustainable platform, can transform sulfur, an industrial by-product, into polymers with broad promising applications such as heavy metal capture, electrochemistry and antimicrobials. However, the process usually requires high temperatures (≥159 °C), and the crosslinkers needed to stabilize the sulfur are therefore limited to high-boiling-point monomers only. Here, we report an alternative route for inverse vulcanization—mechanochemical synthesis, with advantages of mild conditions (room temperature), short reaction time (3 h), high atom economy, less H2S, and broader monomer range. Successful generation of polymers using crosslinkers ranging from aromatic, aliphatic to volatile, including renewable monomers, demonstrates this method is powerful and versatile. Compared with thermal synthesis, the mechanochemically synthesized products show enhanced mercury capture. The resulting polymers show thermal and light induced recycling. The speed, ease, versatility, safety, and green nature of this process offers a more potential future for inverse vulcanization, and enables further unexpected discoveries.","Inverse vulcanization is a process that enables to convert sulfur, a by-product of the petroleum industry, into polymers. Here the authors report a synthetic method of inverse vulcanization via mechanochemical synthesis; compared to thermal routes, a broader range of monomers can be used, and the protocol yields materials with enhanced mercury capture capacity.",2022-08-16
721,Spatiotemporal single-cell regulatory atlas reveals neural crest lineage diversification and cellular function during tooth morphogenesis,"Cranial neural crest cells are an evolutionary innovation of vertebrates for craniofacial development and function, yet the mechanisms that govern the cell fate decisions of postmigratory cranial neural crest cells remain largely unknown. Using the mouse molar as a model, we perform single-cell transcriptome profiling to interrogate the cell fate diversification of postmigratory cranial neural crest cells. We reveal the landscape of transcriptional heterogeneity and define the specific cellular domains during the progression of cranial neural crest cell-derived dental lineage diversification, and find that each domain makes a specific contribution to distinct molar mesenchymal tissues. Furthermore, IGF signaling-mediated cell-cell interaction between the cellular domains highlights the pivotal role of autonomous regulation of the dental mesenchyme. Importantly, we reveal cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks in the dental mesenchyme and show that Foxp4 is indispensable for the differentiation of periodontal ligament. Our single-cell atlas provides comprehensive mechanistic insight into the cell fate diversification process of the cranial neural crest cell-derived odontogenic populations.",The mechanisms that govern cell fate decisions of postmigratory cranial neural crest cells remain largely unknown. Here the authors present a spatiotemporal single-cell regulatory atlas tracking these cells’ dental lineage diversification.,2022-08-16
722,Compound marine heatwaves and ocean acidity extremes,"Compound MHW-OAX events, during which marine heatwaves (MHWs) co-occur with ocean acidity extreme (OAX) events, can have larger impacts on marine ecosystems than the individual extremes. Using monthly open-ocean observations over the period 1982–2019, we show that globally 1.8 in 100 months (or about one out of five present-day MHW months) are compound MHW-OAX event months under a present-day baseline, almost twice as many as expected for 90th percentile extreme event exceedances if MHWs and OAX events were statistically independent. Compound MHW-OAX events are most likely in the subtropics (2.7 in 100 months; 10°−40° latitude) and less likely in the equatorial Pacific and the mid-to-high latitudes (0.7 in 100 months; >40° latitude). The likelihood pattern results from opposing effects of temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon on [H+]. The likelihood is higher where the positive effect on [H+] from increased temperatures during MHWs outweighs the negative effect on [H+] from co-occurring decreases in dissolved inorganic carbon. Daily model output from a large-ensemble simulation of an Earth system model is analyzed to assess changes in the MHW-OAX likelihood under climate change. The projected long-term mean warming and acidification trends have the largest effect on the number of MHW-OAX days per year, increasing it from 12 to 265 days per year at 2 °C global warming relative to a fixed pre-industrial baseline. Even when long-term trends are removed, an increase in [H+] variability leads to a 60% increase in the number of MHW-OAX days under 2 °C global warming. These projected increases may cause severe impacts on marine ecosystems.","Compound extreme events in two or more oceanic ecosystem stressors are increasingly considered as a major concern for marine life. Here the authors present a first global analysis on compound marine heatwave and ocean acidity extreme events, identifying hotspots, drivers, and projecting future changes.",2022-08-16
723,Impedance-based forecasting of lithium-ion battery performance amid uneven usage,"Accurate forecasting of lithium-ion battery performance is essential for easing consumer concerns about the safety and reliability of electric vehicles. Most research on battery health prognostics focuses on the research and development setting where cells are subjected to the same usage patterns. However, in practical operation, there is great variability in use across cells and cycles, thus making forecasting challenging. To address this challenge, here we propose a combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements with probabilistic machine learning methods. Making use of a dataset of 88 commercial lithium-ion coin cells generated via multistage charging and discharging (with currents randomly changed between cycles), we show that future discharge capacities can be predicted with calibrated uncertainties, given the future cycling protocol and a single electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement made immediately before charging, and without any knowledge of usage history. The results are robust to cell manufacturer, the distribution of cycling protocols, and temperature. The research outcome also suggests that battery health is better quantified by a multidimensional vector rather than a scalar state of health.","Accurate forecasts of lithium-ion battery performance will ease concerns about the reliability of electric vehicles. Here, the authors leverage electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and machine learning to show that future capacity can be predicted amid uneven use, with no historical data requirement.",2022-08-16
724,Early treatment regimens achieve sustained virologic remission in infant macaques infected with SIV at birth,"Early antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected infants generally fails to achieve a sustained state of ART-free virologic remission, even after years of treatment. Our studies show that viral reservoir seeding is different in neonatal macaques intravenously exposed to SIV at birth, in contrast to adults. Furthermore, one month of ART including an integrase inhibitor, initiated at day 3, but not day 4 or 5 post infection, efficiently and rapidly suppresses viremia to undetectable levels. Intervention initiated at day 3 post infection and continued for 9 months achieves a sustained virologic remission in 4 of 5 infants. Collectively, an early intervention strategy within a key timeframe and regimen may result in viral remission or successful post-exposure prophylaxis for neonatal SIV infection, which may be clinically relevant for optimizing treatment strategies for HIV-infected or exposed infants.","Neonates and infants infected with HIV generally develop disease rapidly, with early antiretroviral therapy (ART) often failing to achieve a sustained state of ART-free virologic remission. Here, the authors study viral reservoirs in neonatal macaques with early initiation of ART and an integrase inhibitor.",2022-08-16
725,Primary cilia and SHH signaling impairments in human and mouse models of Parkinson’s disease,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) as a progressive neurodegenerative disorder arises from multiple genetic and environmental factors. However, underlying pathological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics, we analyze human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) from sporadic PD (sPD) patients. Alterations in gene expression appear in pathways related to primary cilia (PC). Accordingly, in these hiPSC-derived hNPCs and neurons, we observe a shortening of PC. Additionally, we detect a shortening of PC in PINK1-deficient human cellular and mouse models of familial PD. Furthermore, in sPD models, the shortening of PC is accompanied by increased Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signal transduction. Inhibition of this pathway rescues the alterations in PC morphology and mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, increased SHH activity due to ciliary dysfunction may be required for the development of pathoetiological phenotypes observed in sPD like mitochondrial dysfunction. Inhibiting overactive SHH signaling may be a potential neuroprotective therapy for sPD.","Here, the authors reveal using single-cell RNA sequencing that Parkinson’s disease (PD) patient-derived neuronal cells show altered primary cilia morphology and signaling suggesting cilia dysfunction may underlie PD pathogenesis.",2022-08-16
726,A direct excitatory projection from entorhinal layer 6b neurons to the hippocampus contributes to spatial coding and memory,"The mammalian hippocampal formation (HF) plays a key role in several higher brain functions, such as spatial coding, learning and memory. Its simple circuit architecture is often viewed as a trisynaptic loop, processing input originating from the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and sending it back to its deeper layers. Here, we show that excitatory neurons in layer 6b of the mouse EC project to all sub-regions comprising the HF and receive input from the CA1, thalamus and claustrum. Furthermore, their output is characterized by unique slow-decaying excitatory postsynaptic currents capable of driving plateau-like potentials in their postsynaptic targets. Optogenetic inhibition of the EC-6b pathway affects spatial coding in CA1 pyramidal neurons, while cell ablation impairs not only acquisition of new spatial memories, but also degradation of previously acquired ones. Our results provide evidence of a functional role for cortical layer 6b neurons in the adult brain.","The mammalian hippocampal formation plays a key role in several higher brain functions. Here, the authors show that excitatory neurons in layer 6b of the mouse EC project to all sub-regions comprising the hippocampal formation and receive input from the CA1, thalamus and claustrum.",2022-08-16
727,Copper starvation induces antimicrobial isocyanide integrated into two distinct biosynthetic pathways in fungi,"The genomes of many filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus spp., include diverse biosynthetic gene clusters of unknown function. We previously showed that low copper levels upregulate a gene cluster that includes crmA, encoding a putative isocyanide synthase. Here we show, using untargeted comparative metabolomics, that CrmA generates a valine-derived isocyanide that contributes to two distinct biosynthetic pathways under copper-limiting conditions. Reaction of the isocyanide with an ergot alkaloid precursor results in carbon-carbon bond formation analogous to Strecker amino-acid synthesis, producing a group of alkaloids we term fumivalines. In addition, valine isocyanide contributes to biosynthesis of a family of acylated sugar alcohols, the fumicicolins, which are related to brassicicolin A, a known isocyanide from Alternaria brassicicola. CrmA homologs are found in a wide range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi, some of which produce fumicicolin and fumivaline. Extracts from A. fumigatus wild type (but not crmA-deleted strains), grown under copper starvation, inhibit growth of diverse bacteria and fungi, and synthetic valine isocyanide shows antibacterial activity. CrmA thus contributes to two biosynthetic pathways downstream of trace-metal sensing.","The genomes of filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus, include many biosynthetic gene clusters of unknown function. Here, the authors show that copper starvation induces expression of an enzyme that generates a valine-derived isocyanide participating in two different pathways, for biosynthesis of acylated sugar alcohols and modified ergot alkaloids.",2022-08-16
728,Transcription-independent regulation of STING activation and innate immune responses by IRF8 in monocytes,"Sensing of cytosolic DNA of microbial or cellular/mitochondrial origin by cGAS initiates innate immune responses via the adaptor protein STING. It remains unresolved how the activity of STING is balanced between a productive innate immune response and induction of autoimmunity. Here we show that interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is essential for efficient activation of STING-mediated innate immune responses in monocytes. This function of IRF8 is independent of its transcriptional role in monocyte differentiation. In uninfected cells, IRF8 remains inactive via sequestration of its IRF-associated domain by its N- and C-terminal tails, which reduces its association with STING. Upon triggering the DNA sensing pathway, IRF8 is phosphorylated at Serine 151 to allow its association with STING via the IRF-associated domain. This is essential for STING polymerization and TBK1-mediated STING and IRF3 phosphorylation. Consistently, IRF8-deficiency impairs host defense against the DNA virus HSV-1, and blocks DNA damage-induced cellular senescence. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells which have an autoimmune phenotype due to deficiency of Trex1, respond to IRF-8 deletion with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients are characterized by elevated phosphorylation of IRF8 at the same Serine residue we find to be important in STING activation, and in these cells STING is hyper-active. Taken together, the transcription-independent function of IRF8 we describe here appears to mediate STING activation and represents an important regulatory step in the cGAS/STING innate immune pathway in monocytes.","The transcription factor IRF8 has been shown to regulate monocyte differentiation via its DNA-binding activity. Here authors show that IRF8 is also involved in cytosolic DNA sensing via its phosphorylation-dependent association to the adaptor protein STING, thus representing an important checkpoint between immune response and autoimmunity in monocytes.",2022-08-16
729,A new gene set identifies senescent cells and predicts senescence-associated pathways across tissues,"Although cellular senescence drives multiple age-related co-morbidities through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, in vivo senescent cell identification remains challenging. Here, we generate a gene set (SenMayo) and validate its enrichment in bone biopsies from two aged human cohorts. We further demonstrate reductions in SenMayo in bone following genetic clearance of senescent cells in mice and in adipose tissue from humans following pharmacological senescent cell clearance. We next use SenMayo to identify senescent hematopoietic or mesenchymal cells at the single cell level from human and murine bone marrow/bone scRNA-seq data. Thus, SenMayo identifies senescent cells across tissues and species with high fidelity. Using this senescence panel, we are able to characterize senescent cells at the single cell level and identify key intercellular signaling pathways. SenMayo also represents a potentially clinically applicable panel for monitoring senescent cell burden with aging and other conditions as well as in studies of senolytic drugs.",Identification of senescent cells in vivo remains a challenging task. Here the authors present and validate a senescence gene set called SenMayo enriched in human and murine aged tissues.,2022-08-16
730,Institutional decarbonization scenarios evaluated against the Paris Agreement 1.5 °C goal,"Scientifically rigorous guidance to policy makers on mitigation options for meeting the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal requires an evaluation of long-term global-warming implications of greenhouse gas emissions pathways. Here we employ a uniform and transparent methodology to evaluate Paris Agreement compatibility of influential institutional emission scenarios from the grey literature, including those from Shell, BP, and the International Energy Agency. We compare a selection of these scenarios analysed with this methodology to the Integrated Assessment Model scenarios assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We harmonize emissions to a consistent base-year and account for all greenhouse gases and aerosol precursor emissions, ensuring a self-consistent comparison of climate variables. An evaluation of peak and end-of-century temperatures is made, with both being relevant to the Paris Agreement goal. Of the scenarios assessed, we find that only the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario is aligned with the criteria for Paris Agreement consistency employed here. We investigate root causes for misalignment with these criteria based on the underlying energy system transformation.","Here the authors present a framework to assess the temperature outcomes of decarbonization scenarios from institutions such as the IEA, BP and Shell. Scenarios are evaluated for consistency with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.",2022-08-16
731,Tuning moiré excitons and correlated electronic states through layer degree of freedom,"Moiré coupling in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) superlattices introduces flat minibands that enable strong electronic correlation and fascinating correlated states, and it also modifies the strong Coulomb-interaction-driven excitons and gives rise to moiré excitons. Here, we introduce the layer degree of freedom to the WSe2/WS2 moiré superlattice by changing WSe2 from monolayer to bilayer and trilayer. We observe systematic changes of optical spectra of the moiré excitons, which directly confirm the highly interfacial nature of moiré coupling at the WSe2/WS2 interface. In addition, the energy resonances of moiré excitons are strongly modified, with their separation significantly increased in multilayer WSe2/monolayer WS2 moiré superlattice. The additional WSe2 layers also modulate the strong electronic correlation strength, evidenced by the reduced Mott transition temperature with added WSe2 layer(s). The layer dependence of both moiré excitons and correlated electronic states can be well described by our theoretical model. Our study presents a new method to tune the strong electronic correlation and moiré exciton bands in the TMDCs moiré superlattices, ushering in an exciting platform to engineer quantum phenomena stemming from strong correlation and Coulomb interaction.","Twisted heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides host the so-called moiré excitons, or intralayer excitons modified by the moiré potential. Here the authors show tunability of the moiré excitons and the coexisting correlated electronic states in WSe2/WS2 superlattices with varying WSe2 layer thickness",2022-08-16
732,Earlier onset of North Atlantic hurricane season with warming oceans,"Numerous Atlantic basin tropical cyclones have recently developed prior to the official start of hurricane season, including several pre-season landfalls in the continental United States. Pre-season and early-season tropical cyclones disproportionately affect populated landmasses, often producing outsized precipitation impacts. Here we show a significant trend towards earlier onset of tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic basin, with threshold dates of the first three percentiles of accumulated cyclone energy shifting earlier at a rate exceeding five days decade−1 since 1979, even correcting for biases in climatology due to increased detection of short-lived storms. Initial threshold dates of continental United States named storm landfalls have trended earlier by two days decade−1 since 1900. The trend towards additional pre-season and early-season activity is linked to spring thermodynamic conditions becoming more conducive for tropical cyclone formation. Genesis potential index value increases in the western Atlantic basin are primarily driven by warming ocean temperatures.",There is a significant trend in recent decades towards an earlier start to North Atlantic hurricane seasons. Both the first named storm and first U.S. landfall of the year are occurring earlier. This shift is physically linked to warmer western North Atlantic sea surface temperatures in spring.,2022-08-16
733,ABCA1 is an extracellular phospholipid translocase,"Production of high density lipoprotein (HDL) requires ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) to drive phospholipid (PL) from the plasma membrane into extracellular apolipoprotein A-I. Here, we use simulations to show that domains of ABCA1 within the plasma membrane remove PL from the membrane’s outer leaflet. In our simulations, after the lipid diffuses into the interior of ABCA1’s outward-open cavity, PL extracted by the gateway passes through a ring-shaped domain, the annulus orifice, which forms the base of an elongated hydrophobic tunnel in the transporter’s extracellular domain. Engineered mutations in the gateway and annulus strongly inhibit lipid export by ABCA1 without affecting cell-surface expression levels. Our finding that ABCA1 extracts lipid from the outer face of the plasma membrane and forces it through its gateway and annulus into an elongated hydrophobic tunnel contrasts with the alternating access model, which proposes that ABCA1 flops PL substrate from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the membrane. Consistent with our model, ABCA1 lacks the charged amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain found in the floppase members of the ABC transporter family.","ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) drives phospholipid (PL) from the plasma membrane into extracellular apolipoprotein A-I, for the production of high density lipoprotein (HDL).

734,Mannose ameliorates experimental colitis by protecting intestinal barrier integrity,"Metabolite alteration has been associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including colitis. Mannose, a natural bioactive monosaccharide that is involved in metabolism and synthesis of glycoproteins, exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. We show here that the circulating level of mannose is increased in patients with IBD and mice with experimental colitis. Mannose treatment attenuates intestinal barrier damage in two mouse colitis models, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and spontaneous colitis in IL-10-deficient mice. We demonstrate that mannose treatment enhanced lysosomal integrity and limited the release of cathepsin B, preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)-induced tight junction disruption in the context of intestinal epithelial damage. Mannose exerts a synergistic therapeutic effect with mesalamine on mouse colitis. Cumulatively, the results indicate that mannose supplementation may be an optional approach to the treatment of colitis and other diseases associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction.","New potential therapies for inflammatory bowel disease are needed as not all patients respond to or maintain a response to conventional therapies. Here the authors report that mannose supplementation ameliorates experimental colitis in male mice, potentially via effects on intestinal epithelium lysosomal integrity.",2022-08-16
735,Dynamic cybergenetic control of bacterial co-culture composition via optogenetic feedback,"Communities of microbes play important roles in natural environments and hold great potential for deploying division-of-labor strategies in synthetic biology and bioproduction. However, the difficulty of controlling the composition of microbial consortia over time hinders their optimal use in many applications. Here, we present a fully automated, high-throughput platform that combines real-time measurements and computer-controlled optogenetic modulation of bacterial growth to implement precise and robust compositional control of a two-strain E. coli community. In addition, we develop a general framework for dynamic modeling of synthetic genetic circuits in the physiological context of E. coli and use a host-aware model to determine the optimal control parameters of our closed-loop compositional control system. Our platform succeeds in stabilizing the strain ratio of multiple parallel co-cultures at arbitrary levels and in changing these targets over time, opening the door for the implementation of dynamic compositional programs in synthetic bacterial communities.","Communities of microbes play important roles in natural environments and hold great potential for deploying division-of-labor strategies in synthetic biology and bioproduction. Here, in a community of two competing E. coli strains, the authors show that the relative abundances of the strains can be stabilized and steered dynamically with remarkable precision by coupling the cells to an automated computer-controlled feedback-loop.",2022-08-16
736,Durable radiative cooling against environmental aging,"To fight against global warming, subambient daytime radiative cooling technology provides a promising path to meet sustainable development goals. To achieve subambient daytime radiative cooling, the reflection of most sunlight is the essential prerequisite. However, the desired high solar reflectance is easily dampened by environmental aging, mainly natural soiling and ultraviolet irradiation from sunlight causing yellowish color for most polymers, making the cooling ineffective. We demonstrate a simple strategy to use titanium dioxide nanoparticles, with ultraviolet resistance, forming hierarchical porous morphology via evaporation-driven assembly, which guarantees a balanced anti-soiling and high solar reflectance, rendering anti-aging cooling paint based coatings. We challenge the cooling coatings in an accelerated weathering test against simulated 3 years of natural soiling and simulated 1 year of natural sunshine, and find that the solar reflectance only declined by 0.4% and 0.5% compared with the un-aged ones. We further show over 6 months of aging under real-world conditions with barely no degradation to the cooling performance. Our anti-aging cooling paint is scalable and can be spray coated on desired outdoor architecture and container, presenting durable radiative cooling, promising for real-world applications.","The high solar reflectance needed by radiative cooling is easily dampened by environmental aging. Here, authors describe durable cooling performance against heavy soiling and long-term ultraviolet exposure of paint-based coatings, enhancing the potential of radiative cooling for real-world applications.",2022-08-16
737,Catalytic oxidation of polystyrene to aromatic oxygenates over a graphitic carbon nitride catalyst,"The continuous increase in manufacturing coupled with the difficulty of recycling of plastic products has generated huge amounts of waste plastics. Most of the existing chemical recycling and upcycling methods suffer from harsh conditions and poor product selectivity. Here we demonstrate a photocatalytic method to oxidize polystyrene to aromatic oxygenates under visible light irradiation using heterogeneous graphitic carbon nitride catalysts. Benzoic acid, acetophenone, and benzaldehyde are the dominant products in the liquid phase when the conversion of polystyrene reaches >90% at 150 °C. For the transformation of 0.5 g polystyrene plastic waste, 0.36 g of the aromatic oxygenates is obtained. The reaction mechanism is also investigated with various characterization methods and procedes via polystyrene activation to form hydroxyl and carbonyl groups over its backbone via C–H bond oxidation which is followed by oxidative bond breakage via C–C activation and further oxidation processes to aromatic oxygenates.","There is a real need to create materials capable of plastic recycling and upcycling. Here, the authors report a heterogeneous carbon nitride photocatalyst which efficiently converts polystyrene plastics into aromatic oxygenates, such as benzoic acid.",2022-08-16
738,Chalcogen bond-guided conformational isomerization enables catalytic dynamic kinetic resolution of sulfoxides,"Conformational isomerization can be guided by weak interactions such as chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions. Here we report a catalytic strategy for asymmetric access to chiral sulfoxides by employing conformational isomerization and chalcogen bonding interactions. The reaction involves a sulfoxide bearing two aldehyde moieties as the substrate that, according to structural analysis and DFT calculations, exists as a racemic mixture due to the presence of an intramolecular chalcogen bond. This chalcogen bond formed between aldehyde (oxygen atom) and sulfoxide (sulfur atom), induces a conformational locking effect, thus making the symmetric sulfoxide as a racemate. In the presence of N–heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as catalyst, the aldehyde moiety activated by the chalcogen bond selectively reacts with an alcohol to afford the corresponding chiral sulfoxide products with excellent optical purities. This reaction involves a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process enabled by conformational locking and facile isomerization by chalcogen bonding interactions.","Conformational isomerization of organic molecules can be guided by noncovalent interactions. Here, the authors report the synthesis of chiral sulfoxides catalyzed by N-heterocyclic carbenes; intramolecular chalcogen bonding interactions are key for conformational locking.",2022-08-15
739,Process-oriented analysis of dominant sources of uncertainty in the land carbon sink,"The observed global net land carbon sink is captured by current land models. All models agree that atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen deposition driven gains in carbon stocks are partially offset by climate and land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) losses. However, there is a lack of consensus in the partitioning of the sink between vegetation and soil, where models do not even agree on the direction of change in carbon stocks over the past 60 years. This uncertainty is driven by plant productivity, allocation, and turnover response to atmospheric CO2 (and to a smaller extent to LULCC), and the response of soil to LULCC (and to a lesser extent climate). Overall, differences in turnover explain ~70% of model spread in both vegetation and soil carbon changes. Further analysis of internal plant and soil (individual pools) cycling is needed to reduce uncertainty in the controlling processes behind the global land carbon sink.","The global net land sink is relatively well constrained. However, the responsible drivers and above/below-ground partitioning are highly uncertain. Model issues regarding turnover of individual plant and soil components are responsible.",2022-08-15
740,Visualizing molecular interactions that determine assembly of a bullet-shaped vesicular stomatitis virus particle,"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a negative-strand RNA virus with a non-segmented genome, closely related to rabies virus. Both have characteristic bullet-like shapes. We report the structure of intact, infectious VSV particles determined by cryogenic electron microscopy. By compensating for polymorphism among viral particles with computational classification, we obtained a reconstruction of the shaft (“trunk”) at 3.5 Å resolution, with lower resolution for the rounded tip. The ribonucleoprotein (RNP), genomic RNA complexed with nucleoprotein (N), curls into a dome-like structure with about eight gradually expanding turns before transitioning into the regular helical trunk. Two layers of matrix (M) protein link the RNP with the membrane. Radial inter-layer subunit contacts are fixed within single RNA-N-M1-M2 modules, but flexible lateral and axial interactions allow assembly of polymorphic virions. Together with published structures of recombinant N in various states, our results suggest a mechanism for membrane-coupled self-assembly of VSV and its relatives.","Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is the most widely studied prototype for negative-sense RNA viruses. Structure determination of VSV particles is particularly challenging because they are polymorphic with different helical symmetries. Here, Jenni et al. apply computational classification approaches to sort different morphologies, and obtain CryoEM reconstructions at 3.5–4.1 A resolution. They show that the matrix protein (M) is present in the virion in two layers, of which the inner layer associates with N protein of vRNPs.",2022-08-15
741,Social incentivization of instrumental choice in mice requires amygdala-prelimbic cortex-nucleus accumbens connectivity,"Social experiences influence decision making, including decision making lacking explicit social content, yet mechanistic factors are unclear. We developed a new procedure, social incentivization of future choice (SIFC). Female mice are trained to nose poke for equally-preferred foods, then one food is paired with a novel conspecific, and the other with a novel object. Mice later respond more for the conspecific-associated food. Thus, prior social experience incentivizes later instrumental choice. SIFC is pervasive, occurring following multiple types of social experiences, and is not attributable to warmth or olfactory cues alone. SIFC requires the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL), but not the neighboring orbitofrontal cortex. Further, inputs from the basolateral amygdala to the PL and outputs to the nucleus accumbens are necessary for SIFC, but not memory for a conspecific. Basolateral amygdala→PL connections may signal the salience of social information, leading to the prioritization of coincident rewards via PL→nucleus accumbens outputs.",Social experiences influence future decision making. The authors here establish a method for quantifying this phenomenon in mice and identify an amygdalo-frontal-striatal circuit controlling how social context shapes decisions.,2022-08-15
742,SH3 domain regulation of RhoGAP activity: Crosstalk between p120RasGAP and DLC1 RhoGAP,"RhoGAP proteins are key regulators of Rho family GTPases and influence a variety of cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and cytokinesis. These GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) downregulate Rho signaling by binding and enhancing the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho proteins. Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a tumor suppressor and ubiquitously expressed RhoGAP protein; its activity is regulated in part by binding p120RasGAP, a GAP protein for the Ras GTPases. In this study, we report the co-crystal structure of the p120RasGAP SH3 domain bound directly to DLC1 RhoGAP, at a site partially overlapping the RhoA binding site and impinging on the catalytic arginine finger. We demonstrate biochemically that mutation of this interface relieves inhibition of RhoGAP activity by the SH3 domain. These results reveal the mechanism for inhibition of DLC1 RhoGAP activity by p120RasGAP and demonstrate the molecular basis for direct SH3 domain modulation of GAP activity.","Inhibition of DLC1 RhoGAP by p120RasGAP allows for crosstalk between the Rho and Ras pathways. Here, Chau et al. present the co-crystal structure of DLC1 RhoGAP domain and p120RasGAP SH3 domain and probe the interaction with biochemical studies.",2022-08-15
743,Evidence for a developing plate boundary in the western Mediterranean,"The current diffuse-strain model of the collision between Africa and Eurasia in the western Mediterranean predicts a broad region with deformation distributed among numerous faults and moderate-magnitude seismicity. However, the model is untested because most deformation occurs underwater, at poorly characterized faults of undetermined slip. Here we assess the diffuse-strain model analysing two active offshore fault systems associated with the most prominent seafloor relief in the region. We use pre-stack depth migrated seismic images to estimate, for the first time, the total Plio-Holocene slip of the right-lateral Yusuf and reverse Alboran Ridge structurally linked fault system. We show that kinematic restoration of deformational structures predicts a slip of 16 ± 4.7 km for the Alboran Ridge Fault and a minimum of 12 km for the Yusuf Fault. Thus, this fault system forms a well-defined narrow plate boundary that has absorbed most of the 24 ± 5 km Plio-Holocene Africa-Eurasia convergence and represents an underappreciated hazard.","Conventional models propose multiple fault systems across a diffuse deformation zone absorbing plate convergence in the western Mediterranean. Here the authors show new data supporting the active development of a single plate boundary fault system, representing an underappreciated seismic and tsunami hazard.",2022-08-15
744,"Structural basis of transcriptional regulation by a nascent RNA element, HK022 putRNA","Transcription, in which RNA polymerases (RNAPs) produce RNA from DNA, is the first step of gene expression. As such, it is highly regulated either by trans-elements like protein factors and/or by cis-elements like specific sequences on the DNA. Lambdoid phage HK022 contains a cis-element, put, which suppresses pausing and termination during transcription of the early phage genes. The putRNA transcript solely performs the anti-pausing/termination activities by interacting directly with the E.coli RNAP elongation complex (EC) by an unknown structural mechanism. In this study, we reconstituted putRNA-associated ECs and determined the structures using cryo-electron microscopy. The determined structures of putRNA-associated EC, putRNA-absent EC, and σ70-bound EC suggest that the putRNA interaction with the EC counteracts swiveling, a conformational change previously identified to promote pausing and σ70 might modulate putRNA folding via σ70-dependent pausing during elongation.","HK022 put is an RNA element that inhibits transcription termination without aids from protein factors. Here, authors solved cryo-EM structures of put-associated RNA polymerase and showed the structure of putRNA and its binding to the RNA polymerase.",2022-08-15
745,Precision dynamical mapping using topological data analysis reveals a hub-like transition state at rest,"In the absence of external stimuli, neural activity continuously evolves from one configuration to another. Whether these transitions or explorations follow some underlying arrangement or lack a predictable ordered plan remains to be determined. Here, using fMRI data from highly sampled individuals (~5 hours of resting-state data per individual), we aimed to reveal the rules that govern transitions in brain activity at rest. Our Topological Data Analysis based Mapper approach characterized a highly visited transition state of the brain that acts as a switch between different neural configurations to organize the spontaneous brain activity. Further, while the transition state was characterized by a uniform representation of canonical resting-state networks (RSNs), the periphery of the landscape was dominated by a subject-specific combination of RSNs. Altogether, we revealed rules or principles that organize spontaneous brain activity using a precision dynamics approach.","Although spontaneous brain activity is complex and clinically relevant, it is still unclear whether transitions in resting brain activity follow an underlying arrangement or whether they are unpredictable. In this work, the authors revealed a transition state of the brain that acts like a switch between states and forms the basis for the continuous evolution of brain activity patterns at rest.",2022-08-15
746,ELF5 is a potential respiratory epithelial cell-specific risk gene for severe COVID-19,"Despite two years of intense global research activity, host genetic factors that predispose to a poorer prognosis of COVID-19 infection remain poorly understood. Here, we prioritise eight robust (e.g., ELF5) or suggestive but unreported (e.g., RAB2A) candidate protein mediators of COVID-19 outcomes by integrating results from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative with population-based plasma proteomics using statistical colocalisation. The transcription factor ELF5 (ELF5) shows robust and directionally consistent associations across different outcome definitions, including a >4-fold higher risk (odds ratio: 4.88; 95%-CI: 2.47–9.63; p-value < 5.0 × 10−6) for severe COVID-19 per 1 s.d. higher genetically predicted plasma ELF5. We show that ELF5 is specifically expressed in epithelial cells of the respiratory system, such as secretory and alveolar type 2 cells, using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry. These cells are also likely targets of SARS-CoV-2 by colocalisation with key host factors, including ACE2 and TMPRSS2. In summary, large-scale human genetic studies together with gene expression at single-cell resolution highlight ELF5 as a risk gene for severe COVID-19, supporting a role of epithelial cells of the respiratory system in the adverse host response to SARS-CoV-2.","Genetic factors have been found to be associated with severe COVID-19. Here, the authors integrated genomic, proteomic, and single-cell data to identify ELF5 as a candidate risk gene with a possible role in respiratory epithelial cells, which are targeted by SARS-CoV-2.",2022-08-15
747,The origin of jerky dislocation motion in high-entropy alloys,"Dislocations in single-phase concentrated random alloys, including high-entropy alloys (HEAs), repeatedly encounter pinning during glide, resulting in jerky dislocation motion. While solute-dislocation interaction is well understood in conventional alloys, the origin of individual pinning points in concentrated random alloys is a matter of debate. In this work, we investigate the origin of dislocation pinning in the CoCrFeMnNi HEA. In-situ transmission electron microscopy studies reveal wavy dislocation lines and a jagged glide motion under external loading, even though no segregation or clustering is found around Shockley partial dislocations. Atomistic simulations reproduce the jerky dislocation motion and link the repeated pinning to local fluctuations in the Peierls friction. We demonstrate that the density of high local Peierls friction is proportional to the critical stress required for dislocation glide and the dislocation mobility.",Dislocations in high-entropy alloys encounter pinning during glide resulting in jerky motion. Here the authors demonstrate that the density of high local Peierls force is proportional to the critical stress required for their glide and mobility.,2022-08-15
748,Expression plasticity regulates intraspecific variation in the acclimatization potential of a reef-building coral,"Phenotypic plasticity is an important ecological and evolutionary response for organisms experiencing environmental change, but the ubiquity of this capacity within coral species and across symbiont communities is unknown. We exposed ten genotypes of the reef-building coral Montipora capitata with divergent symbiont communities to four thermal pre-exposure profiles and quantified gene expression before stress testing 4 months later. Here we show two pre-exposure profiles significantly enhance thermal tolerance despite broadly different expression patterns and substantial variation in acclimatization potential based on coral genotype. There was no relationship between a genotype’s basal thermal sensitivity and ability to acquire heat tolerance, including in corals harboring naturally tolerant symbionts, which illustrates the potential for additive improvements in coral response to climate change. These results represent durable improvements from short-term stress hardening of reef-building corals and substantial cryptic complexity in the capacity for plasticity.","Phenotypic plasticity is an important response for organisms experiencing climate change.

Humans can detect errors but cannot provide continuous monitoring or real-time correction. Existing automated approaches are not generalisable across different parts, materials, and printing systems. We train a multi-head neural network using images automatically labelled by deviation from optimal printing parameters. The automation of data acquisition and labelling allows the generation of a large and varied extrusion 3D printing dataset, containing 1.2 million images from 192 different parts labelled with printing parameters. The thus trained neural network, alongside a control loop, enables real-time detection and rapid correction of diverse errors that is effective across many different 2D and 3D geometries, materials, printers, toolpaths, and even extrusion methods. We additionally create visualisations of the network’s predictions to shed light on how it makes decisions.","3D printing is prone to errors and continuous monitoring and real-time correction during processing remains a significant challenge limiting its applied potential. Here, authors train a neural network to detect and correct diverse errors in real time across many geometries, materials and even printing setups.",2022-08-15
750,Confinement-induced accumulation and de-mixing of microscopic active-passive mixtures,"Understanding the out-of-equilibrium properties of noisy microscale systems and the extent to which they can be modulated externally, is a crucial scientific and technological challenge. It holds the promise to unlock disruptive new technologies ranging from targeted delivery of chemicals within the body to directed assembly of new materials. Here we focus on how active matter can be harnessed to transport passive microscopic systems in a statistically predictable way. Using a minimal active-passive system of weakly Brownian particles and swimming microalgae, we show that spatial confinement leads to a complex non-monotonic steady-state distribution of colloids, with a pronounced peak at the boundary. The particles’ emergent active dynamics is well captured by a space-dependent Poisson process resulting from the space-dependent motion of the algae. Based on our findings, we then realise experimentally the de-mixing of the active-passive suspension, opening the way for manipulating colloidal objects via controlled activity fields.","Understanding how order emerges in active matter may facilitate macroscopic control of microscopic objects. Here, Williams et al. show how to control the transport of passive microscopic particles in presence of motile algae in conjunction with boundary-induced accumulation of microswimmers.",2022-08-15
751,A slow-cycling/quiescent cells subpopulation is involved in glioma invasiveness,"Pediatric and adult high-grade gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors, with poor prognosis due to recurrence and tumor infiltration after therapy. Quiescent cells have been implicated in tumor recurrence and treatment resistance, but their direct visualization and targeting remain challenging, precluding their mechanistic study. Here, we identify a population of malignant cells expressing Prominin-1 in a non-proliferating state in pediatric high-grade glioma patients. Using a genetic tool to visualize and ablate quiescent cells in mouse brain cancer and human cancer organoids, we reveal their localization at both the core and the edge of the tumors, and we demonstrate that quiescent cells are involved in infiltration of brain cancer cells. Finally, we find that Harmine, a DYRK1A/B inhibitor, partially decreases the number of quiescent and infiltrating cancer cells. Our data point to a subpopulation of quiescent cells as partially responsible of tumor invasiveness, one of the major causes of brain cancer morbidity.","Quiescent cancer stem cells have been particularly associated to chemoresistance. Here, the authors show that a slowcycling subpopulation in high-grade glioma patients can invade the brain to promote tumourigenesis.",2022-08-15
752,Nitrogen isotope evidence for Earth’s heterogeneous accretion of volatiles,"The origin of major volatiles nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and sulfur in planets is critical for understanding planetary accretion, differentiation, and habitability. However, the detailed process for the origin of Earth’s major volatiles remains unresolved. Nitrogen shows large isotopic fractionations among geochemical and cosmochemical reservoirs, which could be used to place tight constraints on Earth’s volatile accretion process. Here we experimentally determine N-partitioning and -isotopic fractionation between planetary cores and silicate mantles. We show that the core/mantle N-isotopic fractionation factors, ranging from −4‰ to +10‰, are strongly controlled by oxygen fugacity, and the core/mantle N-partitioning is a multi-function of oxygen fugacity, temperature, pressure, and compositions of the core and mantle. After applying N-partitioning and -isotopic fractionation in a planetary accretion and core–mantle differentiation model, we find that the N-budget and -isotopic composition of Earth’s crust plus atmosphere, silicate mantle, and the mantle source of oceanic island basalts are best explained by Earth’s early accretion of enstatite chondrite-like impactors, followed by accretion of increasingly oxidized impactors and minimal CI chondrite-like materials before and during the Moon-forming giant impact. Such a heterogeneous accretion process can also explain the carbon–hydrogen–sulfur budget in the bulk silicate Earth. The Earth may thus have acquired its major volatile inventory heterogeneously during the main accretion phase.",How and when Earth acquired its major volatiles N-C-H-S remains unclear. Here the authors show that Earth may have acquired its major volatiles from both reduced and oxidized impactors before and during the Moon-forming giant impact.,2022-08-15
753,Atomic-scale 3D imaging of individual dopant atoms in an oxide semiconductor,"The physical properties of semiconductors are controlled by chemical doping. In oxide semiconductors, small variations in the density of dopant atoms can completely change the local electric and magnetic responses caused by their strongly correlated electrons. In lightly doped systems, however, such variations are difficult to determine as quantitative 3D imaging of individual dopant atoms is a major challenge. We apply atom probe tomography to resolve the atomic sites that donors occupy in the small band gap semiconductor Er(Mn,Ti)O3 with a nominal Ti concentration of 0.04 at. %, map their 3D lattice positions, and quantify spatial variations. Our work enables atomic-level 3D studies of structure-property relations in lightly doped complex oxides, which is crucial to understand and control emergent dopant-driven quantum phenomena.","Small variations in the density of dopants change the physical properties of complex oxides.

754,Resistance to the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutant inhibitor ivosidenib can be overcome by alternative dimer-interface binding inhibitors,"Ivosidenib, an inhibitor of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) R132C and R132H variants, is approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Resistance to ivosidenib due to a second site mutation of IDH1 R132C, leading to IDH1 R132C/S280F, has emerged. We describe biochemical, crystallographic, and cellular studies on the IDH1 R132C/S280F and R132H/S280F variants that inform on the mechanism of second-site resistance, which involves both modulation of inhibitor binding at the IDH1 dimer-interface and alteration of kinetic properties, which enable more efficient 2-HG production relative to IDH1 R132C and IDH1 R132H. Importantly, the biochemical and cellular results demonstrate that it should be possible to overcome S280F mediated resistance in AML patients by using alternative inhibitors, including some presently in phase 2 clinical trials.",The development of IDH variant inhibitors is a breakthrough as it is the first time metabolism has been successfully targeted by small molecule drugs in cancer.

755,Circular EZH2-encoded EZH2-92aa mediates immune evasion in glioblastoma via inhibition of surface NKG2D ligands,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumour and is resistant to nearly all available treatments, including natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapy. However, the factors mediating NK cell evasion in GBM remain largely unclear. Here, we report that EZH2-92aa, a protein encoded by circular EZH2, is overexpressed in GBM and induces the immune evasion of GBM stem cells (GSCs) from NK cells. Positively regulated by DEAD-box helicase 3 (DDX3), EZH2-92aa directly binds the major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A/B (MICA/B) promoters and represses their transcription; it also indirectly represses UL16-binding protein (ULBP) transcription by stabilizing EZH2. The downregulation of NK group 2D ligands (NKG2DLs, including MICA/B and ULBPs) in GSCs mediates NK cell resistance. Moreover, stable EZH2-92aa knockdown enhances NK cell-mediated GSC eradication in vitro and in vivo and synergizes with anti-PD1 therapy. Our results highlight the immunosuppressive function of EZH2-92aa in inhibiting the NK cell response in GBM and the clinical potential of targeting EZH2-92aa for NK-cell-directed immune therapy.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor, frequently resistant to therapies, including natural killer (NK) cell based immunotherapy.

756,Sirt2 promotes white matter oligodendrogenesis during development and in models of neonatal hypoxia,"Delayed oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation caused by hypoxia (Hx)-induced neonatal brain injury results in hypomyelination and leads to neurological disabilities. Previously, we characterized Sirt1 as a crucial regulator of OL progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation in response to Hx. We now identify Sirt2 as a critical promoter of OL differentiation during both normal white matter development and in a mouse model of Hx. Importantly, we find that Hx reduces Sirt2 expression in mature OLs and that Sirt2 overexpression in OPCs restores mature OL populations. Reduced numbers of Sirt2+ OLs were also observed in the white matter of preterm human infants. We show that Sirt2 interacts with p27Kip1/FoxO1, p21Cip1/Cdk4, and Cdk5 pathways, and that these interactions are altered by Hx. Furthermore, Hx induces nuclear translocation of Sirt2 in OPCs where it binds several genomic targets. Overall, these results indicate that a balance of Sirt1 and Sirt2 activity is required for developmental oligodendrogenesis, and that these proteins represent potential targets for promoting repair following white matter injury.",Neonatal hypoxia leads to white matter hypomyelination due to delayed oligodendrocyte maturation.

757,"Second-dose ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines and thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events in Scotland","We investigated thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events following a second dose of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 using a self-controlled case series analysis. We used a national prospective cohort with 2.0 million(m) adults vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx or 1.6 m with BNT162b2. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 14–20 days post-ChAdOx1 second dose was 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90–5.08. The incidence of ITP post-second dose ChAdOx1 was 0.59 (0.37–0.89) per 100,000 doses. No evidence of an increased risk of CVST was found for the 0–27 day risk period (IRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.16 to 4.26). However, few (≤5) events arose within this risk period. It is perhaps noteworthy that these events all clustered in the 7–13 day period (IRR 4.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 17.51). No other associations were found for second dose ChAdOx1, or any association for second dose BNT162b2 vaccination. Second dose ChAdOx1 vaccination was associated with increased borderline risks of ITP and CVST events. However, these events were rare thus providing reassurance about the safety of these vaccines. Further analyses including more cases are required to determine more precisely the risk profile for ITP and CVST after a second dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine.","Here, Simpson et al. analyze data from 3.6 million COVID-19 vaccine second doses (ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2) in Scotland for risk of thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events.

758,Parametric longitudinal coupling between a high-impedance superconducting resonator and a semiconductor quantum dot singlet-triplet spin qubit,"Coupling qubits to a superconducting resonator provides a mechanism to enable long-distance entangling operations in a quantum computer based on spins in semiconducting materials. Here, we demonstrate a controllable spin-photon coupling based on a longitudinal interaction between a spin qubit and a resonator. We show that coupling a singlet-triplet qubit to a high-impedance superconducting resonator can produce the desired longitudinal coupling when the qubit is driven near the resonator’s frequency. We measure the energy splitting of the qubit as a function of the drive amplitude and frequency of a microwave signal applied near the resonator antinode, revealing pronounced effects close to the resonator frequency due to longitudinal coupling. By tuning the amplitude of the drive, we reach a regime with longitudinal coupling exceeding 1 MHz. This mechanism for qubit-resonator coupling represents a stepping stone towards producing high-fidelity two-qubit gates mediated by a superconducting resonator.",It has been predicted that longitudinal coupling between a qubit and a superconducting resonator can mediate efficient interactions among distant qubits. Here the authors implement such a coupling between a singlet-triplet qubit in a semiconductor double quantum dot and a high-impedance superconducting resonator.,2022-08-15
759,Visualization of conformational changes and membrane remodeling leading to genome delivery by viral class-II fusion machinery,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a human pathogen that delivers its genome to the host cell cytoplasm through endocytic low pH-activated membrane fusion mediated by class-II fusion proteins. Though structures of prefusion, icosahedral CHIKV are available, structural characterization of virion interaction with membranes has been limited. Here, we have used cryo-electron tomography to visualize CHIKV’s complete membrane fusion pathway, identifying key intermediary glycoprotein conformations coupled to membrane remodeling events. Using sub-tomogram averaging, we elucidate features of the low pH-exposed virion, nucleocapsid and full-length E1-glycoprotein’s post-fusion structure. Contrary to class-I fusion systems, CHIKV achieves membrane apposition by protrusion of extended E1-glycoprotein homotrimers into the target membrane. The fusion process also features a large hemifusion diaphragm that transitions to a wide pore for intact nucleocapsid delivery. Our analyses provide comprehensive ultrastructural insights into the class-II virus fusion system function and direct mechanistic characterization of the fundamental process of protein-mediated membrane fusion.","Membrane fusion is essential for cellular entry of enveloped viruses. Here, authors use time-resolved cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to capture 3D organization and population evolution of intermediates during membrane fusion of CHIKV, a medically important alphavirus.",2022-08-15
760,Structures of UBA6 explain its dual specificity for ubiquitin and FAT10,"The covalent modification of target proteins with ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers is initiated by E1 activating enzymes, which typically transfer a single modifier onto cognate conjugating enzymes. UBA6 is an unusual E1 since it activates two highly distinct modifiers, ubiquitin and FAT10. Here, we report crystal structures of UBA6 in complex with either ATP or FAT10. In the UBA6-FAT10 complex, the C-terminal domain of FAT10 binds to where ubiquitin resides in the UBA1-ubiquitin complex, however, a switch element ensures the alternate recruitment of either modifier. Simultaneously, the N-terminal domain of FAT10 interacts with the 3-helix bundle of UBA6. Site-directed mutagenesis identifies residues permitting the selective activation of either ubiquitin or FAT10. These results pave the way for studies investigating the activation of either modifier by UBA6 in physiological and pathophysiological settings.","UBA6 is an E1 enzyme that can activate both ubiquitin and FAT10.

761,Secure human action recognition by encrypted neural network inference,"Advanced computer vision technology can provide near real-time home monitoring to support “aging in place” by detecting falls and symptoms related to seizures and stroke. Affordable webcams, together with cloud computing services (to run machine learning algorithms), can potentially bring significant social benefits. However, it has not been deployed in practice because of privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a strategy that uses homomorphic encryption to resolve this dilemma, which guarantees information confidentiality while retaining action detection. Our protocol for secure inference can distinguish falls from activities of daily living with 86.21% sensitivity and 99.14% specificity, with an average inference latency of 1.2 seconds and 2.4 seconds on real-world test datasets using small and large neural nets, respectively. We show that our method enables a 613x speedup over the latency-optimized LoLa and achieves an average of 3.1x throughput increase in secure inference compared to the throughput-optimized nGraph-HE2.","Advanced computer vision technology can provide near real-time home monitoring to support ""aging in place” by detecting falls and symptoms related to seizures and stroke.

762,Exploratory analysis of eating- and physical activity-related outcomes from a randomized controlled trial for weight loss maintenance with exercise and liraglutide single or combination treatment,"Weight regain after weight loss remains a major challenge in obesity treatment and may involve alteration of eating and sedentary behavior after weight loss. In this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, adults with obesity were randomized, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio stratified by sex and age group (<40 years and ≥40 years), to one-year weight loss maintenance with exercise, the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide, or the combination, as compared with placebo, after low-calorie diet-induced weight loss. Primary outcome was change in body weight, which has been published. Here, we investigated the effects of weight loss maintenance with exercise, liraglutide, or the combination on weight loss-induced changes in the pre-specified explorative outcomes, eating and sedentary behavior in 130 participants who completed the trial according to the study protocol (exercise (n = 26), liraglutide (n = 36), combination (n = 29), and placebo (n = 39)). One year after weight loss, the placebo group had decreased postprandial appetite suppression score by 14%, and increased sedentary time by 31 min/day and regained weight. Liraglutide prevented the decrease in postprandial appetite suppression score compared with placebo (0% vs. −14%; P = 0.023) and maintained weight loss. Exercise after weight loss did not increase appetite or sedentary behavior compared with placebo, despite increased exercise energy expenditure and maintained weight loss. The combination of exercise and liraglutide increased cognitive restraint score (13% vs. −9%; P = 0.042), reflecting a conscious restriction of food intake, and decreased sedentary time by 41 min/day (−10 vs. 31 min/day; 95%CI, −82.3 to −0.2; P = 0.049) compared with placebo, which may have facilitated the additional weight loss. Targeting both eating and sedentary behavior could be the most effective for preventing weight regain.Trial registration: EudraCT number, 2015-005585-32; clinicaltrials.gov number, NCT04122716.",Weight regain after weight loss is a challenge in obesity treatment and may involve altered eating and sedentary behaviour after weight loss.

763,Strigolactones are chemoattractants for host tropism in Orobanchaceae parasitic plants,"Parasitic plants are worldwide threats that damage major agricultural crops. To initiate infection, parasitic plants have developed the ability to locate hosts and grow towards them. This ability, called host tropism, is critical for parasite survival, but its underlying mechanism remains mostly unresolved. To characterise host tropism, we used the model facultative root parasite Phtheirospermum japonicum, a member of the Orobanchaceae. Here, we show that strigolactones (SLs) function as host-derived chemoattractants. Chemotropism to SLs is also found in Striga hermonthica, a parasitic member of the Orobanchaceae, but not in non-parasites. Intriguingly, chemotropism to SLs in P. japonicum is attenuated in ammonium ion-rich conditions, where SLs are perceived, but the resulting asymmetrical accumulation of the auxin transporter PIN2 is diminished. P. japonicum encodes putative receptors that sense exogenous SLs, whereas expression of a dominant-negative form reduces its chemotropic ability. We propose a function for SLs as navigators for parasite roots.",Parasitic plants are able to grow towards potential hosts.

764,Piperazine-derived lipid nanoparticles deliver mRNA to immune cells in vivo,"In humans, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have safely delivered therapeutic RNA to hepatocytes after systemic administration and to antigen-presenting cells after intramuscular injection. However, systemic RNA delivery to non-hepatocytes remains challenging, especially without targeting ligands such as antibodies, peptides, or aptamers. Here we report that piperazine-containing ionizable lipids (Pi-Lipids) preferentially deliver mRNA to immune cells in vivo without targeting ligands. After synthesizing and characterizing Pi-Lipids, we use high-throughput DNA barcoding to quantify how 65 chemically distinct LNPs functionally delivered mRNA (i.e., mRNA translated into functional, gene-editing protein) in 14 cell types directly in vivo. By analyzing the relationships between lipid structure and cellular targeting, we identify lipid traits that increase delivery in vivo. In addition, we characterize Pi-A10, an LNP that preferentially delivers mRNA to the liver and splenic immune cells at the clinically relevant dose of 0.3 mg/kg. These data demonstrate that high-throughput in vivo studies can identify nanoparticles with natural non-hepatocyte tropism and support the hypothesis that lipids with bioactive small-molecule motifs can deliver mRNA in vivo.","Next-generation lipid nanoparticles that target non-hepatocytes could be important clinical tools. Using in vivo DNA barcoding, the authors identify piperazine-containing lipids deliver mRNA to immune cells without targeting ligands.",2022-08-15
765,Efficient separation of butane isomers via ZIF-8 slurry on laboratory- and pilot-scale,"n-butane and isobutane are important petrochemical raw materials. Their separation is challenging because of their similar properties, including boiling point. Here, we report a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8)/N,N-Dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU)-water slurry as sorption material to separate butane mixtures. The isobutane/n-butane selectivity of ZIF-8/DMPU-water slurries is as high as 890 with high kinetic performance, which transcends the upper limit of various separation materials or membranes reported in the literature. More encouragingly, a continuous pilot separation device was established, and the test results show that the purity and recovery ratio of isobutane product are 99.46 mol% and 87%, respectively, which are superior to the corresponding performance (98.56 mol% and 54%) of the industrial distillation tower. To the best of our knowledge, the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for gas separation in pilot scale remains underexplored, and thus this work provides a step forward to the commercial application of MOFs in gas separation.","The separation of butane isomers, raw materials in petrochemical industry, is challenging.

766,Regional connectivity drove bidirectional transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East during travel restrictions,"Regional connectivity and land travel have been identified as important drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the generalizability of this finding is understudied outside of well-sampled, highly connected regions. In this study, we investigated the relative contributions of regional and intercontinental connectivity to the source-sink dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 for Jordan and the Middle East. By integrating genomic, epidemiological and travel data we show that the source of introductions into Jordan was dynamic across 2020, shifting from intercontinental seeding in the early pandemic to more regional seeding for the travel restrictions period. We show that land travel, particularly freight transport, drove introduction risk during the travel restrictions period. High regional connectivity and land travel also drove Jordan’s export risk. Our findings emphasize regional connectedness and land travel as drivers of transmission in the Middle East.","The dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Middle East have been relatively under-studied. Here, the authors integrate genomic and travel data and show that introductions to the region were initially driven by intercontinental air travel, after which regional land travel became a more important driver.",2022-08-15
767,Distractibility and impulsivity neural states are distinct from selective attention and modulate the implementation of spatial attention,"In the context of visual attention, it has been classically assumed that missing the response to a target or erroneously selecting a distractor occurs as a consequence of the (miss)allocation of attention in space. In the present paper, we challenge this view and provide evidence that, in addition to encoding spatial attention, prefrontal neurons also encode a distractibility-to-impulsivity state. Using supervised dimensionality reduction techniques in prefrontal neuronal recordings in monkeys, we identify two partially overlapping neuronal subpopulations associated either with the focus of attention or overt behaviour. The degree of overlap accounts for the behavioral gain associated with the good allocation of attention. We further describe the neural variability accounting for distractibility-to-impulsivity behaviour by a two dimensional state associated with optimality in task and responsiveness. Overall, we thus show that behavioral performance arises from the integration of task-specific neuronal processes and pre-existing neuronal states describing task-independent behavioral states.","Failing to detect relevant information has been assumed to be a consequence of misallocation of attention. Here, the authors present findings showing that optimal behavioral performance results from the absence of interference between internal neural states and attention control.",2022-08-15
768,Structural basis for Sarbecovirus ORF6 mediated blockage of nucleocytoplasmic transport,"The emergence of heavily mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) place the international community on high alert. In addition to numerous mutations that map in the spike protein of VOCs, expression of the viral accessory proteins ORF6 and ORF9b also elevate; both are potent interferon antagonists. Here, we present the crystal structures of Rae1-Nup98 in complex with the C-terminal tails (CTT) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV ORF6 to 2.85 Å and 2.39 Å resolution, respectively. An invariant methionine (M) 58 residue of ORF6 CTT extends its side chain into a hydrophobic cavity in the Rae1 mRNA binding groove, resembling a bolt-fitting-hole; acidic residues flanking M58 form salt-bridges with Rae1. Our mutagenesis studies identify key residues of ORF6 important for its interaction with Rae1-Nup98 in vitro and in cells, of which M58 is irreplaceable. Furthermore, we show that ORF6-mediated blockade of mRNA and STAT1 nucleocytoplasmic transport correlate with the binding affinity between ORF6 and Rae1-Nup98. Finally, binding of ORF6 to Rae1-Nup98 is linked to ORF6-induced interferon antagonism. Taken together, this study reveals the molecular basis for the antagonistic function of Sarbecovirus ORF6, and implies a strategy of using ORF6 CTT-derived peptides for immunosuppressive drug development.","Sarbecovirus ORF6 binds to the Rae1-Nup98 complex, a component of the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex, and has been shown to suppress interferon responses.

769,PKD1 and PKD2 mRNA cis-inhibition drives polycystic kidney disease progression,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), among the most common human genetic conditions and a frequent etiology of kidney failure, is primarily caused by heterozygous PKD1 mutations. Kidney cyst formation occurs when PKD1 dosage falls below a critical threshold. However, no framework exists to harness the remaining allele or reverse PKD1 decline. Here, we show that mRNAs produced by the noninactivated PKD1 allele are repressed via their 3′-UTR miR-17 binding element. Eliminating this motif (Pkd1∆17) improves mRNA stability, raises Polycystin-1 levels, and alleviates cyst growth in cellular, ex vivo, and mouse PKD models. Remarkably, Pkd2 is also inhibited via its 3′-UTR miR-17 motif, and Pkd2∆17-induced Polycystin-2 derepression retards cyst growth in Pkd1-mutant models. Moreover, acutely blocking Pkd1/2 cis-inhibition, including after cyst onset, attenuates murine PKD. Finally, modeling PKD1∆17 or PKD2∆17 alleles in patient-derived primary ADPKD cultures leads to smaller cysts, reduced proliferation, lower pCreb1 expression, and improved mitochondrial membrane potential. Thus, evading 3′-UTR cis-interference and enhancing PKD1/2 mRNA translation is a potentially mutation-agnostic ADPKD-arresting approach.","ADPKD, a common aetiology of kidney failure, is caused by heterozygous PKD1 or PKD2 mutations. Here the authors show that preventing 3′-UTR cis-inhibition of mRNAs produced by the non-inactivated PKD1/2 alleles ameliorates preclinical ADPKD.",2022-08-15
770,Three-dimensional electron ptychography of organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructures,"Three dimensional scaffolded DNA origami with inorganic nanoparticles has been used to create tailored multidimensional nanostructures. However, the image contrast of DNA is poorer than those of the heavy nanoparticles in conventional transmission electron microscopy at high defocus so that the biological and non-biological components in 3D scaffolds cannot be simultaneously resolved using tomography of samples in a native state. We demonstrate the use of electron ptychography to recover high contrast phase information from all components in a DNA origami scaffold without staining. We further quantitatively evaluate the enhancement of contrast in comparison with conventional transmission electron microscopy. In addition, We show that for ptychography post-reconstruction focusing simplifies the workflow and reduces electron dose and beam damage.",The authors demonstrate electron ptychographic computed tomography by simultaneously recording high contrast data from both the organic- and inorganic components in a 3D DNA-origami framework hybrid nanostructure.,2022-08-15
771,Chimeric GPCRs mimic distinct signaling pathways and modulate microglia responses,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate processes ranging from immune responses to neuronal signaling. However, ligands for many GPCRs remain unknown, suffer from off-target effects or have poor bioavailability. Additionally, dissecting cell type-specific responses is challenging when the same GPCR is expressed on different cells within a tissue. Here, we overcome these limitations by engineering DREADD-based GPCR chimeras that bind clozapine-N-oxide and mimic a GPCR-of-interest. We show that chimeric DREADD-β2AR triggers responses comparable to β2AR on second messenger and kinase activity, post-translational modifications, and protein-protein interactions. Moreover, we successfully recapitulate β2AR-mediated filopodia formation in microglia, an immune cell capable of driving central nervous system inflammation. When dissecting microglial inflammation, we included two additional DREADD-based chimeras mimicking microglia-enriched GPR65 and GPR109A. DREADD-β2AR and DREADD-GPR65 modulate the inflammatory response with high similarity to endogenous β2AR, while DREADD-GPR109A shows no impact. Our DREADD-based approach allows investigation of cell type-dependent pathways without known endogenous ligands.","Understanding the function of GPCRs requires stimulation with their specific ligands. Here, the authors design chemogenetic G-protein coupled receptors that allows for the study of receptors without knowing the immediate ligand, and demonstrate its use for the β2-adrenergic receptor in microglia.",2022-08-15

Here, we report that recombinant miniature spidroins, and importantly also the N-terminal domain (NT) on its own, rapidly form self-supporting and transparent hydrogels at 37 °C. The gelation is caused by NT α-helix to β-sheet conversion and formation of amyloid-like fibrils, and fusion proteins composed of NT and green fluorescent protein or purine nucleoside phosphorylase form hydrogels with intact functions of the fusion moieties. Our findings demonstrate that recombinant NT and fusion proteins give high expression yields and bestow attractive properties to hydrogels, e.g., transparency, cross-linker free gelation and straightforward immobilization of active proteins at high density.","Recombinant spider silks are of interest but the multimodal and aggregation-prone nature of them is a limitation. Here, the authors report on a miniature spidroin based on the N-terminal domain which forms a hydrogel at 37 °C which allows for ease of production and fusion protein modification to generate functional biomaterials.",2022-08-15
773,Diverse synthesis of α-tertiary amines and tertiary alcohols via desymmetric reduction of malonic esters,"Amines and alcohols with a fully substituted α-carbon are structures of great value in organic synthesis and drug discovery. While conventional methods towards these motifs often rely on enantioselective carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bond formation reactions, a desymmetric method is developed here by selectively hydrosilylating one of the esters of easily accessible α-substituted α-amino- and -oxymalonic esters. The desymmetrization is enabled by a suite of dinuclear zinc catalysts with pipecolinol-derived tetradentate ligands and can accommodate a diverse panel of heteroatom substituents, including secondary amides, tertiary amines, and ethers of different sizes. The polyfunctionalized reduction products, in return, have provided expeditious approaches to enantioenriched nitrogen- and oxygen-containing molecules, including dipeptides, vitamin analogs, and natural metabolites.","Chiral α-tertiary amines and tertiary alcohols are prevalent in bioactive molecules yet challenging targets to access. Here, the authors provide a dinuclear zinc-catalyzed desymmetric approach based on readily available malonic esters.",2022-08-13
774,Vaccine effectiveness of CoronaVac against COVID-19 among children in Brazil during the Omicron period,"Although severe COVID-19 in children is rare, they may develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome, long-COVID and downstream effects of COVID-19, including social isolation and disruption of education. Data on the effectiveness of the CoronaVac vaccine is scarce during the Omicron period. In Brazil, children between 6 to 11 years are eligible to receive the CoronaVac vaccine. We conducted a test-negative design to estimate vaccine effectiveness using 197,958 tests from January 21, 2022, to April 15, 2022, during the Omicron dominant period in Brazil among children aged 6 to 11 years. The estimated vaccine effectiveness for symptomatic infection was 39.8% (95% CI 33.7–45.4) at ≥14 days post-second dose. For hospital admission vaccine effectiveness was 59.2% (95% CI 11.3–84.5) at ≥14 days. Two doses of CoronaVac in children during the Omicron period showed low levels of protection against symptomatic infection, and modest levels against severe illness.","There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of the CoronaVac vaccine for children against the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant. Here, the authors use data from Brazil for children aged 6–11 years and estimate effectiveness of 40% against infection and 59% against severe disease at least two weeks after the second dose.",2022-08-13
775,Imbibition-induced selective wetting of liquid metal,"Herein, we present the imbibition-induced, spontaneous, and selective wetting characteristics of gallium-based liquid metal alloys on a metallized surface with micro-scale topographical features. Gallium-based liquid metal alloys are fascinating materials that have enormous surface tension; therefore, they are difficult to pattern into films. The complete wetting of eutectic alloy of gallium and indium is realized on microstructured copper surfaces in the presence of HCl vapor, which removes the native oxide from the liquid metal alloy. This wetting is numerically explained based on the Wenzel’s model and imbibition process, revealing that the dimensions of the microstructures are critical for effective imbibition-driven wetting of the liquid metal. Further, we demonstrate that the spontaneous wetting of the liquid metal can be directed selectively along the microstructured region on the metallic surface to create patterns. This simple process enables the uniform coating and patterning of the liquid metal over large areas without an external force or complex processing. We demonstrate that the liquid metal-patterned substrates maintain electrical connection even in a stretched state and after repetitive stretching cycles.","Liquid metals that have enormous surface tension are difficult to pattern into films. Here, authors report the spontaneous and selective wetting of a gallium-based liquid metal, which is induced by imbibition on a micro-structured metallized substrate.",2022-08-13
776,Anionic nanoplastic exposure induces endothelial leakiness,"The global-scale production of plastics has been instrumental in advancing modern society, while the rising accumulation of plastics in landfills, oceans, and anything in between has become a major stressor on environmental sustainability, climate, and, potentially, human health. While mechanical and chemical forces of man and nature can eventually break down or recycle plastics, our understanding of the biological fingerprints of plastics, especially of nanoplastics, remains poor. Here we report on a phenomenon associated with the nanoplastic forms of anionic polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate), where their introduction disrupted the vascular endothelial cadherin junctions in a dose-dependent manner, as revealed by confocal fluorescence microscopy, signaling pathways, molecular dynamics simulations, as well as ex vivo and in vivo assays with animal model systems. Collectively, our results implicated nanoplastics-induced vasculature permeability as primarily biophysical-biochemical in nature, uncorrelated with cytotoxic events such as reactive oxygen species production, autophagy, and apoptosis. This uncovered route of paracellular transport has opened up vast avenues for investigating the behaviour and biological effects of nanoplastics, which may offer crucial insights for guiding innovations towards a sustainable plastics industry and environmental remediation.","In this study, the authors report that anionic nanoplastics can harness the paracellular space of endothelial cells and puncture blood vasculature ex vivo and in vivo, thereby entailing new environmental and health implications.",2022-08-13
777,Rapid evolution of mutation rate and spectrum in response to environmental and population-genetic challenges,"Ecological and demographic factors can significantly shape the evolution of microbial populations both directly and indirectly, as when changes in the effective population size affect the efficiency of natural selection on the mutation rate. However, it remains unclear how rapidly the mutation-rate responds evolutionarily to the entanglement of ecological and population-genetic factors over time. Here, we directly assess the mutation rate and spectrum of Escherichia coli clones isolated from populations evolving in response to 1000 days of different transfer volumes and resource-replenishment intervals. The evolution of mutation rates proceeded rapidly in response to demographic and/or environmental changes, with substantial bidirectional shifts observed as early as 59 generations. These results highlight the remarkable rapidity by which mutation rates are shaped in asexual lineages in response to environmental and population-genetic forces, and are broadly consistent with the drift-barrier hypothesis for the evolution of mutation rates, while also highlighting situations in which mutator genotypes may be promoted by positive selection.","How rapidly the mutation rate responds evolutionarily to ecological and population-genetic factors over time is unclear. Here, the authors show that the evolution of mutation rates in E. coli proceeds rapidly in response to these factors with substantial bidirectional shifts.",2022-08-13
778,Prohormone convertase 1/3 deficiency causes obesity due to impaired proinsulin processing,"Defective insulin processing is associated with obesity and diabetes. Prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3) is an endopeptidase required for the processing of neurotransmitters and hormones. PC1/3 deficiency and genome-wide association studies relate PC1/3 with early onset obesity. Here, we find that deletion of PC1/3 in obesity-related neuronal cells expressing proopiomelanocortin mildly and transiently change body weight and fail to produce a phenotype when targeted to Agouti-related peptide- or nestin-expressing tissues. In contrast, pancreatic β cell-specific PC1/3 ablation induces hyperphagia with consecutive obesity despite uncontrolled diabetes with glucosuria. Obesity develops not due to impaired pro-islet amyloid polypeptide processing but due to impaired insulin maturation. Proinsulin crosses the blood-brain-barrier but does not induce central satiety. Accordingly, insulin therapy prevents hyperphagia. Further, islet PC1/3 expression levels negatively correlate with body mass index in humans. In this work, we show that impaired PC1/3-mediated proinsulin processing, as observed in human prediabetes, promotes hyperphagic obesity.","Defective insulin secretion is observed early in the development of diabetes. Here the authors report that β cell-specific deficiency of the insulin prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3) leads not only to hyperglycemia, but also to hyperphagic obesity in mice.",2022-08-13
779,Individuals with ventromedial frontal damage display unstable but transitive preferences during decision making,"The ventromedial frontal lobe (VMF) is important for decision-making, but the precise causal role of the VMF in the decision process has not been fully established. Previous studies have suggested that individuals with VMF damage violate transitivity, a hallmark axiom of rational decisions. However, these prior studies cannot properly distinguish whether individuals with VMF damage are truly prone to choosing irrationally from whether their preferences are simply more variable. We had individuals with focal VMF damage, individuals with other frontal damage, and healthy controls make repeated choices across three categories—artworks, chocolate bar brands, and gambles. Using proper tests of transitivity, we find that, in our study, individuals with VMF damage make rational decisions consistent with transitive preferences, even though they exhibit greater variability in their preferences. That is, the VMF is necessary for having strong and reliable preferences, but not for being a rational decision maker. VMF damage affects the variability with which value is assessed, but not the consistency with which value is sought.","The ventromedial frontal lobes (VMF) contribute to encoding of value. Here the authors show that individuals with VMF damage have less stable, but fundamentally transitive preferences, suggesting that valuation does not solely rely on the VMF.",2022-08-13
780,A mid-infrared lab-on-a-chip for dynamic reaction monitoring,"Mid-infrared spectroscopy is a sensitive and selective technique for probing molecules in the gas or liquid phase. Investigating chemical reactions in bio-medical applications such as drug production is recently gaining particular interest. However, monitoring dynamic processes in liquids is commonly limited to bulky systems and thus requires time-consuming offline analytics. In this work, we show a next-generation, fully-integrated and robust chip-scale sensor for online measurements of molecule dynamics in a liquid solution. Our fingertip-sized device utilizes quantum cascade technology, combining the emitter, sensing section and detector on a single chip. This enables real-time measurements probing only microliter amounts of analyte in an in situ configuration. We demonstrate time-resolved device operation by analyzing temperature-induced conformational changes of the model protein bovine serum albumin in heavy water. Quantitative measurements reveal excellent performance characteristics in terms of sensor linearity, wide coverage of concentrations, extending from 0.075 mg ml−1 to 92 mg ml−1 and a 55-times higher absorbance than state-of-the-art bulky and offline reference systems.","Rapid investigation of chemical reactions is a challenge in bio-medical analysis. Here, the authors demonstrate sensitive in-situ real-time reaction-monitoring of conformational changes in protein solution, based on a fingertip-sized mid-IR lab-on-a-chip.",2022-08-13
781,XPC–PARP complexes engage the chromatin remodeler ALC1 to catalyze global genome DNA damage repair,"Cells employ global genome nucleotide excision repair (GGR) to eliminate a broad spectrum of DNA lesions, including those induced by UV light. The lesion-recognition factor XPC initiates repair of helix-destabilizing DNA lesions, but binds poorly to lesions such as CPDs that do not destabilize DNA. How difficult-to-repair lesions are detected in chromatin is unknown. Here, we identify the poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases PARP1 and PARP2 as constitutive interactors of XPC. Their interaction results in the XPC-stimulated synthesis of poly-(ADP-ribose) (PAR) by PARP1 at UV lesions, which in turn enables the recruitment and activation of the PAR-regulated chromatin remodeler ALC1. PARP2, on the other hand, modulates the retention of ALC1 at DNA damage sites. Notably, ALC1 mediates chromatin expansion at UV-induced DNA lesions, leading to the timely clearing of CPD lesions. Thus, we reveal how chromatin containing difficult-to-repair DNA lesions is primed for repair, providing insight into mechanisms of chromatin plasticity during GGR.","Cells employ global genome nucleotide excision repair to repair a broad spectrum of genomic DNA lesions. Here, the authors reveal how chromatin is primed for repair, providing insight into mechanisms of chromatin plasticity during DNA repair.",2022-08-13
782,Adaptation to novel spatially-structured environments is driven by the capsule and alters virulence-associated traits,"The extracellular capsule is a major virulence factor, but its ubiquity in free-living bacteria with large environmental breadths suggests that it shapes adaptation to novel niches. Yet, how it does so, remains unexplored. Here, we evolve three Klebsiella strains and their capsule mutants in parallel. Their comparison reveals different phenotypic and genotypic evolutionary changes that alter virulence-associated traits. Non-capsulated populations accumulate mutations that reduce exopolysaccharide production and increase biofilm formation and yield, whereas most capsulated populations become hypermucoviscous, a signature of hypervirulence. Hence, adaptation to novel environments primarily occurs by fine-tuning expression of the capsular locus. The same evolutionary conditions selecting for mutations in the capsular gene wzc leading to hypermucoviscosity also result in increased susceptibility to antibiotics by mutations in the ramA regulon. This implies that general adaptive processes outside the host can affect capsule evolution and its role in virulence and infection outcomes may be a by-product of such adaptation.","Phenotypic and genotypic evolution in worrisome Klebsiella spp. is influenced by the capsule. Here the authors show that adaptation outside the host can impact virulence-associated traits, including de novo emergence of hypermucoviscosity.",2022-08-13
783,Reformation of the chondroitin sulfate glycocalyx enables progression of AR-independent prostate cancer,"Lineage plasticity of prostate cancer is associated with resistance to androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition (ARPI) and supported by a reactive tumor microenvironment. Here we show that changes in chondroitin sulfate (CS), a major glycosaminoglycan component of the tumor cell glycocalyx and extracellular matrix, is AR-regulated and promotes the adaptive progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after ARPI. AR directly represses transcription of the 4-O-sulfotransferase gene CHST11 under basal androgen conditions, maintaining steady-state CS in prostate adenocarcinomas. When AR signaling is inhibited by ARPI or lost during progression to non-AR-driven CRPC as a consequence of lineage plasticity, CHST11 expression is unleashed, leading to elevated 4-O-sulfated chondroitin levels. Inhibition of the tumor cell CS glycocalyx delays CRPC progression, and impairs growth and motility of prostate cancer after ARPI. Thus, a reactive CS glycocalyx supports adaptive survival and treatment resistance after ARPI, representing a therapeutic opportunity in patients with advanced prostate cancer.","Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is one of the most abundant glycosaminoglycans in prostate cancers. Here the authors show that inhibition of the androgen receptor pathway leads to the upregulation of CS, which promotes prostate cancer growth and metastasis.",2022-08-13
784,Visual evoked feedforward–feedback traveling waves organize neural activity across the cortical hierarchy in mice,"Sensory processing is distributed among many brain regions that interact via feedforward and feedback signaling. Neuronal oscillations have been shown to mediate intercortical feedforward and feedback interactions. Yet, the macroscopic structure of the multitude of such oscillations remains unclear. Here, we show that simple visual stimuli reliably evoke two traveling waves with spatial wavelengths that cover much of the cerebral hemisphere in awake mice. 30-50 Hz feedforward waves arise in primary visual cortex (V1) and propagate rostrally, while 3-6 Hz feedback waves originate in the association cortex and flow caudally. The phase of the feedback wave modulates the amplitude of the feedforward wave and synchronizes firing between V1 and parietal cortex. Altogether, these results provide direct experimental evidence that visual evoked traveling waves percolate through the cerebral cortex and coordinate neuronal activity across broadly distributed networks mediating visual processing.","Processing sensory stimuli requires coordinated activation of neurons broadly distributed across many distant cortical sites, yet it is not clear how this coordination is accomplished in the brain. Here, the authors show that visual stimuli reliably evoke traveling waves of activity that percolate through the cortex and orchestrate neuronal firing across primary visual and association cortices.",2022-08-13
785,Extraction of accurate cytoskeletal actin velocity distributions from noisy measurements,"Dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for many cellular processes. Tracking the movement of individual actin filaments can in principle shed light on how this complex behavior arises at the molecular level. However, the information that can be extracted from these measurements is often limited by low signal-to-noise ratios. We developed a Bayesian statistical approach to estimate true, underlying velocity distributions from the tracks of individual actin-associated fluorophores with quantified localization uncertainties. We found that the motion of filamentous (F)-actin in fibroblasts and endothelial cells was better described by a statistical jump process than by models in which filaments undergo continuous, diffusive movement. In particular, a model with exponentially distributed jump length- and time-scales recapitulated actin filament velocity distributions measured for the cell cortex, integrin-based adhesions, and stress fibers, suggesting that a common physical model can potentially describe actin filament dynamics in a variety of cellular contexts.","Dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton underlies cell movement, but is challenging to characterize at the molecular level. Here, the authors present a method to extract actin filament velocities in living cells, and compare their results to current models of cytoskeletal dynamics.",2022-08-13
786,Empirical evidence on the efficiency of backward contact tracing in COVID-19,"Standard contact tracing practice for COVID-19 is to identify persons exposed to an infected person during the contagious period, assumed to start two days before symptom onset or diagnosis. In the first large cohort study on backward contact tracing for COVID-19, we extended the contact tracing window by 5 days, aiming to identify the source of the infection and persons infected by the same source. The risk of infection amongst these additional contacts was similar to contacts exposed during the standard tracing window and significantly higher than symptomatic individuals in a control group, leading to 42% more cases identified as direct contacts of an index case. Compared to standard practice, backward traced contacts required fewer tests and shorter quarantine. However, they were identified later in their infectious cycle if infected. Our results support implementing backward contact tracing when rigorous suppression of viral transmission is warranted.","Backward contact tracing aims to identify individuals who were infected by the same person as infected an index case, and has been shown to be effective in modelling studies of SARS-COV-2. Here, the authors present empirical data of the effectiveness of backward contact tracing from a program amongst university students in Belgium.",2022-08-13
787,Zero dispersion Kerr solitons in optical microresonators,"Solitons are shape preserving waveforms that are ubiquitous across nonlinear dynamical systems from BEC to hydrodynamics, and fall into two separate classes: bright solitons existing in anomalous group velocity dispersion, and switching waves forming ‘dark solitons’ in normal dispersion. Bright solitons in particular have been relevant to chip-scale microresonator frequency combs, used in applications across communications, metrology, and spectroscopy. Both have been studied, yet the existence of a structure between this dichotomy has only been theoretically predicted. We report the observation of dissipative structures embodying a hybrid between switching waves and dissipative solitons, existing in the regime of vanishing group velocity dispersion where third-order dispersion is dominant, hence termed as ‘zero-dispersion solitons’. They are observed to arise from the interlocking of two modulated switching waves, forming a stable solitary structure consisting of a quantized number of peaks. The switching waves form directly via synchronous pulse-driving of a Si3N4 microresonator. The resulting comb spectrum spans 136 THz or 97% of an octave, further enhanced by higher-order dispersive wave formation. This dissipative structure expands the domain of Kerr cavity physics to the regime near to zero-dispersion and could present a superior alternative to conventional solitons for broadband comb generation.","Here, the authors find the missing link for soliton microcombs that exist at the boundary where the group velocity dispersion of light changes sign: zero-dispersion solitons. The resulting microresonator frequency comb, based in Si3N4, spans almost an octave.",2022-08-13
788,A method for Boolean analysis of protein interactions at a molecular level,"Determining the levels of protein–protein interactions is essential for the analysis of signaling within the cell, characterization of mutation effects, protein function and activation in health and disease, among others. Herein, we describe MolBoolean – a method to detect interactions between endogenous proteins in various subcellular compartments, utilizing antibody-DNA conjugates for identification and signal amplification. In contrast to proximity ligation assays, MolBoolean simultaneously indicates the relative abundances of protein A and B not interacting with each other, as well as the pool of A and B proteins that are proximal enough to be considered an AB complex. MolBoolean is applicable both in fixed cells and tissue sections. The specific and quantifiable data that the method generates provide opportunities for both diagnostic use and medical research.","Determination of interactions between native proteins in cells is important for understanding function. Here the authors report MolBoolean as a method to detect interactions between endogenous proteins in subcellular compartments, using antibody-DNA conjugates for identification and signal amplification.",2022-08-13
789,[3+2] Cycloaddition of alkyl aldehydes and alkynes enabled by photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer,"[3+2] Cycloaddition is a step- and atom-economic method for the synthesis of five-membered rings. Despite the great success of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, the radical [3+2] annulation of alkynes remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a photoinduced decatungstate-catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of various internal alkynes using abundant aliphatic aldehydes as a three-carbon synthon is developed, producing elaborate cyclopentanones in 100% atom economy with excellent site-, regio-, and diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. The catalytic cycle consists of hydrogen atom abstraction from aldehydes, radical addition, 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer, anti-Baldwin 5-endo-trig cyclization, and back hydrogen abstraction. The power of this method is showcased by the late-stage elaboration of medicinally relevant molecules and total or formal synthesis of (±)-β-cuparenone, (±)-laurokamurene B, and (±)-cuparene.","In contrast to the prevalence of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, radical [3+2] annulations of alkynes are underexplored.

790,Excitation energy mediated cross-relaxation for tunable upconversion luminescence from a single lanthanide ion,"Precise control of energy migration between sensitizer ions and activator ions in lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) nowadays has been extensively investigated to achieve efficient photon upconversion. However, these UCNPs generally emit blue, green or red light only under fixed excitation conditions. In this work, regulation of the photon transition process between different energy levels of a single activator ion to obtain tunable upconversion fluorescence under different excitation conditions is achieved by introducing a modulator ion. The cross-relaxation process between modulator ion and activator ion can be controlled to generate tunable luminescence from the same lanthanide activator ion under excitation at different wavelengths or with different laser power density and pulse frequency. This strategy has been tested and proven effective in two different nanocrystal systems and its usefulness has been demonstrated for high-level optical encryption.","Here, the authors report tunable luminescence from a single lanthanide ion upon changing excitation conditions through co-doping an energy-modulator ion, thus adjusting the photon transition process of the lanthanide activator ion. Optical encryption has also been demonstrated as an application of this universal strategy.",2022-08-12
791,Conformational enantiodiscrimination for asymmetric construction of atropisomers,"Molecular conformations induced by the rotation about single bonds play a crucial role in chemical transformations. Revealing the relationship between the conformations of chiral catalysts and the enantiodiscrimination is a formidable challenge due to the great difficulty in isolating the conformers. Herein, we report a chiral catalytic system composed of an achiral catalytically active unit and an axially chiral 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) unit which are connected via a C–O single bond. The two conformers of the catalyst induced by the rotation about the C–O bond, are determined via single-crystal X-ray diffraction and found to respectively lead to the formation of highly important axially chiral 1,1′-binaphthyl-2,2′-diamine (BINAM) and 2-amino-2′-hydroxy-1,1′-binaphthyl (NOBIN) derivatives in high yields (up to 98%), with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98:2 e.r.) and opposite absolute configurations. The results highlight the importance of conformational dynamics of chiral catalysts in asymmetric catalysis.",Molecular flexiblity and conformational dynamics of chiral catalysts are not often taken into account in models of enantiodiscrimination. Here the authors design a catalytic system in which two conformers of the same catalyst can lead to axially chiral products of opposite absolute configurations.,2022-08-12
792,Control of non-REM sleep by ventrolateral medulla glutamatergic neurons projecting to the preoptic area,"Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying sleep state transitions is a fundamental goal of neurobiology and important for the development of new treatments for insomnia and other sleep disorders. Yet, brain circuits controlling this process remain poorly understood. Here we identify a population of sleep-active glutamatergic neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) that project to the preoptic area (POA), a prominent sleep-promoting region, in mice. Microendoscopic calcium imaging demonstrate that these VLM glutamatergic neurons display increased activity during the transitions from wakefulness to Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. Chemogenetic silencing of POA-projecting VLM neurons suppresses NREM sleep, whereas chemogenetic activation of these neurons promotes NREM sleep. Moreover, we show that optogenetic activation of VLM glutamatergic neurons or their projections in the POA initiates NREM sleep in awake mice. Together, our findings uncover an excitatory brainstem-hypothalamic circuit that controls the wake-sleep transitions.","In this study, Teng et al. identify a population of glutamatergic neurons in the ventrolateral medulla that control Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep in mice. They uncover an excitatory brainstem-hypothalamic circuit that controls wake-sleep transitions.",2022-08-12
793,Generation of a CRISPR activation mouse that enables modelling of aggressive lymphoma and interrogation of venetoclax resistance,"CRISPR technologies have advanced cancer modelling in mice, but CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) methods have not been exploited in this context. We establish a CRISPRa mouse (dCas9a-SAMKI) for inducing gene expression in vivo and in vitro. Using dCas9a-SAMKI primary lymphocytes, we induce B cell restricted genes in T cells and vice versa, demonstrating the power of this system. There are limited models of aggressive double hit lymphoma. Therefore, we transactivate pro-survival BCL-2 in Eµ-MycT/+;dCas9a-SAMKI/+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Mice transplanted with these cells rapidly develop lymphomas expressing high BCL-2 and MYC. Unlike standard Eµ-Myc lymphomas, BCL-2 expressing lymphomas are highly sensitive to the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. We perform genome-wide activation screens in these lymphoma cells and find a dominant role for the BCL-2 protein A1 in venetoclax resistance. Here we show the potential of our CRISPRa model for mimicking disease and providing insights into resistance mechanisms towards targeted therapies.","Modelling of aggressive lymphomas, such as double hit lymphoma, has been challenging. Here the authors engineer a CRISPR activation mouse to enable the generation of these aggressive lymphomas and identify the pro-survival BCL-2 protein A1 as a venetoclax resistance factor.",2022-08-12
794,Molecular ensemble junctions with inter-molecular quantum interference,"We report of a high yield method to form nanopore molecular ensembles junctions containing ~40,000 molecules, in which the semimetal bismuth (Bi) is a top contact. Conductance histograms of these junctions are double-peaked (bi-modal), a behavior that is typical for single molecule junctions but not expected for junctions with thousands of molecules. This unique observation is shown to result from a new form of quantum interference that is inter-molecular in nature, which occurs in these junctions since the very long coherence length of the electrons in Bi enables them to probe large ensembles of molecules while tunneling through the junctions. Under such conditions, each molecule within the ensembles becomes an interference path that modifies via its tunneling phase the electronic structure of the entire junction. This new form of quantum interference holds a great promise for robust novel conductance effects in practical molecular junctions.","Quantum interference effect in the conductance of single molecule junctions has been attracting intensive interest in recent years. Here, Li and Selzer show the presence of intermolecular quantum interference over 40,000 molecules in a molecular ensemble junction with bismuth as the top electrode.",2022-08-12
795,Molecular engineering of dihydroxyanthraquinone-based electrolytes for high-capacity aqueous organic redox flow batteries,"Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are a promising technology for large-scale electricity energy storage to realize efficient utilization of intermittent renewable energy. In particular, organic molecules are a class of metal-free compounds that consist of earth-abundant elements with good synthetic tunability, electrochemical reversibility and reaction rates. However, the short cycle lifetime and low capacity of AORFBs act as stumbling blocks for their practical deployment. To circumvent these issues, here, we report molecular engineered dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ)-based alkaline electrolytes. Via computational studies and operando measurements, we initially demonstrate the presence of a hydrogen bond-mediated degradation mechanism of DHAQ molecules during electrochemical reactions. Afterwards, we apply a molecular engineering strategy based on redox-active polymers to develop capacity-boosting composite electrolytes. Indeed, by coupling a 1,5-DHAQ/poly(anthraquinonyl sulfide)/carbon black anolyte and a [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− alkaline catholyte, we report an AORFB capable of delivering a stable cell discharge capacity of about 573 mAh at 20 mA/cm2 after 1100 h of cycling and an average cell discharge voltage of about 0.89 V at the same current density.","Aqueous organic redox flow batteries are affected by short cycle life and low capacity.

796,Mycobacterial resistance to zinc poisoning requires assembly of P-ATPase-containing membrane metal efflux platforms,"The human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires a P1B-ATPase metal exporter, CtpC (Rv3270), for resistance to zinc poisoning. Here, we show that zinc resistance also depends on a chaperone-like protein, PacL1 (Rv3269). PacL1 contains a transmembrane domain, a cytoplasmic region with glutamine/alanine repeats and a C-terminal metal-binding motif (MBM). PacL1 binds Zn2+, but the MBM is required only at high zinc concentrations. PacL1 co-localizes with CtpC in dynamic foci in the mycobacterial plasma membrane, and the two proteins form high molecular weight complexes. Foci formation does not require flotillin nor the PacL1 MBM. However, deletion of the PacL1 Glu/Ala repeats leads to loss of CtpC and sensitivity to zinc. Genes pacL1 and ctpC appear to be in the same operon, and homologous gene pairs are found in the genomes of other bacteria. Furthermore, PacL1 colocalizes and functions redundantly with other PacL orthologs in M. tuberculosis. Overall, our results indicate that PacL proteins may act as scaffolds that assemble P-ATPase-containing metal efflux platforms mediating bacterial resistance to metal poisoning.","The human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires a metal exporter, CtpC, for resistance to zinc poisoning.

797,High activity and selectivity of single palladium atom for oxygen hydrogenation to H2O2,"Nanosized palladium (Pd)-based catalysts are widely used in the direct hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis from H2 and O2, while its selectivity and yield remain inferior because of the O-O bond cleavage from both the reactant O2 and the produced H2O2, which is assumed to have originated from various O2 adsorption configurations on the Pd nanoparticles. Herein, single Pd atom catalyst with high activity and selectivity is reported. Density functional theory calculations certify that the O-O bond breaking is significantly inhibited on the single Pd atom and the O2 is easier to be activated to form *OOH, which is a key intermediate for H2O2 synthesis; in addition, H2O2 degradation is shut down. Here, we show single Pd atom catalyst displays a remarkable H2O2 yield of 115 mol/gPd/h and H2O2 selectivity higher than 99%; while the concentration of H2O2 reaches 1.07 wt.% in a batch.","Nanosized Pd-based catalysts are widely used in the direct hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis from H2 and O2, while the selectivity and yield of H2O2 remain inferior.

798,Dynamic magnetic crossover at the origin of the hidden-order in van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr,"The van-der-Waals material CrSBr stands out as a promising two-dimensional magnet. Here, we report on its detailed magnetic and structural characteristics. We evidence that it undergoes a transition to an A-type antiferromagnetic state below TN ≈ 140 K with a pronounced two-dimensional character, preceded by ferromagnetic correlations within the monolayers. Furthermore, we unravel the low-temperature hidden-order within the long-range magnetically-ordered state. We find that it is associated to a slowing down of the magnetic fluctuations, accompanied by a continuous reorientation of the internal field. These take place upon cooling below Ts ≈ 100 K, until a spin freezing process occurs at T* ≈ 40 K. We argue this complex behavior to reflect a crossover driven by the in-plane uniaxial anisotropy, which is ultimately caused by its mixed-anion character. Our findings reinforce CrSBr as an important candidate for devices in the emergent field of two-dimensional magnetic materials.",A 2D magnet CrSBr has attracted interest for applications in spintronics due to its high critical temperature and interesting magneto-electrical properties. Here the authors report a detailed study of its magnetic and structural phases and uncover a hidden magnetic order inside the magnetically-ordered phase.,2022-08-12
799,Direct observation of ideal electromagnetic fluids,"Near-zero-index (NZI) media have been theoretically identified as media where electromagnetic radiations behave like ideal electromagnetic fluids. Within NZI media, the electromagnetic power flow obeys equations similar to those of motion for the velocity field in an ideal fluid, so that optical turbulence is intrinsically inhibited. Here, we experimentally observe the electromagnetic power flow distribution of such an ideal electromagnetic fluid propagating within a cutoff waveguide by a semi-analytical reconstruction technique. This technique provides direct proof of the inhibition of electromagnetic vorticity at the NZI frequency, even in the presence of complex obstacles and topological changes in the waveguide. Phase uniformity and spatially-static field distributions, essential characteristics of NZI materials, are also observed. Measurement of the same structure outside the NZI frequency range reveals existence of vortices in the power flow, as expected for conventional optical systems. Therefore, our results provide an important step forward in the development of ideal electromagnetic fluids, and introduce a tool to explore the subwavelength behavior of NZI media including fully vectorial and phase information.","This paper reports an experimental observation of irrotational, inviscid, and incompressible electromagnetic power flow within an epsilon-near-zero medium, exhibiting an analogy to an ideal fluid.",2022-08-12
800,Practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution with composable security,"A quantum key distribution (QKD) system must fulfill the requirement of universal composability to ensure that any cryptographic application (using the QKD system) is also secure. Furthermore, the theoretical proof responsible for security analysis and key generation should cater to the number N of the distributed quantum states being finite in practice. Continuous-variable (CV) QKD based on coherent states, despite being a suitable candidate for integration in the telecom infrastructure, has so far been unable to demonstrate composability as existing proofs require a rather large N for successful key generation. Here we report a Gaussian-modulated coherent state CVQKD system that is able to overcome these challenges and can generate composable keys secure against collective attacks with N ≈ 2 × 108 coherent states. With this advance, possible due to improvements to the security proof and a fast, yet low-noise and highly stable system operation, CVQKD implementations take a significant step towards their discrete-variable counterparts in practicality, performance, and security.","Continuous-variable QKD protocols are usually easier to implement than discrete-variables ones, but their security analyses are less developed. Here, the authors propose and demonstrate in the lab a CVQKD protocol that can generate composable keys secure against collective attacks.",2022-08-12
801,"Protection of COVID-19 vaccination and previous infection against Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and Delta SARS-CoV-2 infections","Given the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants and the roll-out of booster COVID-19 vaccination, evidence is needed on protection conferred by primary vaccination, booster vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by variant. We employed a test-negative design on S-gene target failure data from community PCR testing in the Netherlands from 22 November 2021 to 31 March 2022 (n = 671,763). Previous infection, primary vaccination or both protected well against Delta infection. Protection against Omicron BA.1 infection was much lower compared to Delta. Protection was similar against Omicron BA.1 compared to BA.2 infection after previous infection, primary and booster vaccination. Higher protection was observed against all variants in individuals with both vaccination and previous infection compared with either one. Protection against all variants decreased over time since last vaccination or infection. We found that primary vaccination with current COVID-19 vaccines and previous SARS-CoV-2 infections offered low protection against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 infection. Booster vaccination considerably increased protection against Omicron infection, but decreased rapidly after vaccination.","The protection of COVID-19 vaccines against emerging variants needs to be monitored. Here, the authors use community testing data from the Netherlands and find that protection against infection by Omicron subvariants BA.1 and 2 is low and that booster vaccines considerably but temporarily increase protection.",2022-08-12
802,The role of natural gas in reaching net-zero emissions in the electric sector,"Replacing coal with natural gas has contributed to recent emissions reductions in the electric sector, but there are questions about the near- and long-term roles for gas under deep decarbonization. In this study, we assess the potential role for natural gas and carbon removal in deeply decarbonized electricity systems in the U.S. and evaluate the robustness of these insights to key technology and policy assumptions. We find that natural-gas-fired generation can lower the cost of electric sector decarbonization, a result that is robust to a range of sensitivities, when carbon removal is allowed under policy. Accelerating decarbonization to reach net-zero in 2035 entails greater contributions from natural gas than in 2050. Nonetheless, wind and solar have higher generation shares than natural gas for most regions and scenarios (52-66% variable renewables for net-zero scenarios versus 0-19% for gas), suggesting that natural gas generation can be substituted more easily than its capacity.","Natural gas and carbon removal can play roles in reaching net-zero emissions in the U.S. electric sector and can lower decarbonization costs, though wind and solar have higher generation shares for most regions and scenarios.",2022-08-12
803,CNT-molecule-CNT (1D-0D-1D) van der Waals integration ferroelectric memory with 1-nm2 junction area,"The device’s integration of molecular electronics is limited regarding the large-scale fabrication of gap electrodes on a molecular scale. The van der Waals integration (vdWI) of a vertically aligned molecular layer (0D) with 2D or 3D electrodes indicates the possibility of device’s integration; however, the active junction area of 0D-2D and 0D-3D vdWIs remains at a microscale size. Here, we introduce the robust fabrication of a vertical 1D-0D-1D vdWI device with the ultra-small junction area of 1 nm2 achieved by cross-stacking top carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on molecularly assembled bottom CNTs. 1D-0D-1D vdWI memories are demonstrated through ferroelectric switching of azobenzene molecules owing to the cis-trans transformation combined with the permanent dipole moment of the end-tail -CF3 group. In this work, our 1D-0D-1D vdWI memory exhibits a retention performance above 2000 s, over 300 cycles with an on/off ratio of approximately 105 and record current density (3.4 × 108 A/cm2), which is 100 times higher than previous study through the smallest junction area achieved in a vdWI. The simple stacking of aligned CNTs (4 × 4) allows integration of memory arrays (16 junctions) with high device operational yield (100%), offering integration guidelines for future molecular electronics.","The van der Waals integration of molecular layer (0D) with 2D or 3D electrodes is limited at microscale junction. Here, the authors introduce 1D-0D-1D vdWI memory with 1 nm2 junction achieved by cross-stacking t-CNT on molecularly assembled b-CNT.",2022-08-12
804,Structural basis for receptor selectivity and inverse agonism in S1P5 receptors,"The bioactive lysophospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) acts via five different subtypes of S1P receptors (S1PRs) - S1P1-5. S1P5 is predominantly expressed in nervous and immune systems, regulating the egress of natural killer cells from lymph nodes and playing a role in immune and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as carcinogenesis. Several S1PR therapeutic drugs have been developed to treat these diseases; however, they lack receptor subtype selectivity, which leads to side effects. In this article, we describe a 2.2 Å resolution room temperature crystal structure of the human S1P5 receptor in complex with a selective inverse agonist determined by serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory X-Ray Free Electron Laser (PAL-XFEL) and analyze its structure-activity relationship data. The structure demonstrates a unique ligand-binding mode, involving an allosteric sub-pocket, which clarifies the receptor subtype selectivity and provides a template for structure-based drug design. Together with previously published S1PR structures in complex with antagonists and agonists, our structure with S1P5-inverse agonist sheds light on the activation mechanism and reveals structural determinants of the inverse agonism in the S1PR family.","S1P5 is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor implicated in immune and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, authors report a crystal structure of the S1P5 receptor in complex with a selective inverse agonist, revealing an allosteric subpocket and shedding light on inverse agonism in S1P receptors.",2022-08-12
805,Single-atom nanozymes catalytically surpassing naturally occurring enzymes as sustained stitching for brain trauma,"Regenerable nanozymes with high catalytic stability and sustainability are promising substitutes for naturally-occurring enzymes but are limited by insufficient and non-selective catalytic activities. Herein, we developed single-atom nanozymes of RhN4, VN4, and Fe-Cu-N6 with catalytic activities surpassing natural enzymes. Notably, Rh/VN4 preferably forms an Rh/V-O-N4 active center to decrease reaction energy barriers and mediates a “two-sided oxygen-linked” reaction path, showing 4 and 5-fold higher affinities in peroxidase-like activity than the FeN4 and natural horseradish peroxidase. Furthermore, RhN4 presents a 20-fold improved affinity in the catalase-like activity compared to the natural catalase; Fe-Cu-N6 displays selectivity towards the superoxide dismutase-like activity; VN4 favors a 7-fold higher glutathione peroxidase-like activity than the natural glutathione peroxidase. Bioactive sutures with Rh/VN4 show recyclable catalytic features without apparent decay in 1 month and accelerate the scalp healing from brain trauma by promoting the vascular endothelial growth factor, regulating the immune cells like macrophages, and diminishing inflammation.","The catalytic activity of regenerable nanozymes is currently the bottle neck for their wider employment. Here, the authors report on single-atom nanozymes of RhN4, VN4, and Fe-Cu-N6 with higher catalytic activities than natural enzymes, and demonstrate the Rh/VN4 recyclability and scalp healing properties in bioactive sutures.",2022-08-12
806,In-conduit capture of sub-micron volcanic ash particles via turbophoresis and sintering,"Ash emission in explosive silicic eruptions can have widespread impacts for human health, agriculture, infrastructure, and aviation. Estimates of the total grainsize distribution (TGSD) generated during explosive magma fragmentation underpins eruption models and ash dispersal forecasts. Conventionally, the TGSD constrained via erupted deposits is assumed to match the TGSD produced at explosive fragmentation. Here we present observations from within the vent of a recent rhyolitic eruption (Cordón Caulle, Chile, 2011–2012), demonstrating that fine (<63 μm diameter) and ultra-fine (<2.5 μm diameter) ash particles are captured and sintered to fracture surfaces, and thus sequestered in the shallow subsurface, rather than emitted. We establish a conceptual model—uniquely contextualised through a combination of syn-eruptive observations and detailed post-eruption field investigation—in which turbophoresis (particle migration towards zones of lower turbulence) and rapid sintering create an inverse relationship between particle size and the probability of its subsurface capture. Such size-dependent capture efficiency preferentially removes submicron-diameter ash from the erupted componentry, decoupling the erupted size distribution from magmatic source conditions and potentially playing an important role in modulating eruption dynamics.","Here the authors document evidence of ultrafine ash captured within ash-venting nozzles at Cordón Caulle volcano (Chile). This decouples eruptive processes from the emitted products, as explained by a new model of in-vent ash migration and sticking.",2022-08-11
807,Structural insights into inhibitory mechanism of human excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT2,"Glutamate is a pivotal excitatory neurotransmitter in mammalian brains, but excessive glutamate causes numerous neural disorders. Almost all extracellular glutamate is retrieved by the glial transporter, Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2 (EAAT2), belonging to the SLC1A family. However, in some cancers, EAAT2 expression is enhanced and causes resistance to therapies by metabolic disturbance. Despite its crucial roles, the detailed structural information about EAAT2 has not been available. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of human EAAT2 in substrate-free and selective inhibitor WAY213613-bound states at 3.2 Å and 2.8 Å, respectively. EAAT2 forms a trimer, with each protomer consisting of transport and scaffold domains. Along with a glutamate-binding site, the transport domain possesses a cavity that could be disrupted during the transport cycle. WAY213613 occupies both the glutamate-binding site and cavity of EAAT2 to interfere with its alternating access, where the sensitivity is defined by the inner environment of the cavity. We provide the characterization of the molecular features of EAAT2 and its selective inhibition mechanism that may facilitate structure-based drug design for EAAT2.","EAAT2 is an amino acid transporter implicated in glutamate homeostasis in brain and therapy resistance of cancer cells. Here, the authors report cryo-EM structures and reveal inhibitory mechanisms via selective inhibitor WAY213613.",2022-08-11
808,Biocatalytic routes to stereo-divergent iridoids,"Thousands of natural products are derived from the fused cyclopentane-pyran molecular scaffold nepetalactol. These natural products are used in an enormous range of applications that span the agricultural and medical industries. For example, nepetalactone, the oxidized derivative of nepetalactol, is known for its cat attractant properties as well as potential as an insect repellent. Most of these naturally occurring nepetalactol-derived compounds arise from only two out of the eight possible stereoisomers, 7S-cis-trans and 7R-cis-cis nepetalactols. Here we use a combination of naturally occurring and engineered enzymes to produce seven of the eight possible nepetalactol or nepetalactone stereoisomers. These enzymes open the possibilities for biocatalytic production of a broader range of iridoids, providing a versatile system for the diversification of this important natural product scaffold.","Iridoid compounds are an important class of natural products. Here, the authors report on the discovery and engineering of nepetalactol-related short chain reductases and their application for the biosynthesis of nepetalactol or nepetalactone stereoisomers, as a versatile system for the production of the iridoid natural product scaffold.",2022-08-11
809,The causes and consequences of Alzheimer’s disease: phenome-wide evidence from Mendelian randomization,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has no proven causal and modifiable risk factors, or effective interventions. We report a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of genetic liability for AD in 334,968 participants of the UK Biobank study, stratified by age. We also examined the effects of AD genetic liability on previously implicated risk factors. We replicated these analyses in the HUNT study. PheWAS hits and previously implicated risk factors were followed up in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to identify the causal effect of each risk factor on AD risk. A higher genetic liability for AD was associated with medical history and cognitive, lifestyle, physical and blood-based measures as early as 39 years of age. These effects were largely driven by the APOE gene. The follow-up MR analyses were primarily null, implying that most of these associations are likely to be a consequence of prodromal disease or selection bias, rather than the risk factor causing the disease.","Observational studies have found overlap between Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases and phenotypes, although the causal relationships are unclear. Here, the authors perform an age-stratified phenome-wide association study of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) genetic liability and follow-up Mendelian randomization analyses to examine whether these phenotypes have a causal effect on AD.",2022-08-11
810,Thermal adaptation best explains Bergmann’s and Allen’s Rules across ecologically diverse shorebirds,"Bergmann’s and Allen’s rules state that endotherms should be larger and have shorter appendages in cooler climates. However, the drivers of these rules are not clear. Both rules could be explained by adaptation for improved thermoregulation, including plastic responses to temperature in early life. Non-thermal explanations are also plausible as climate impacts other factors that influence size and shape, including starvation risk, predation risk, and foraging ecology. We assess the potential drivers of Bergmann’s and Allen’s rules in 30 shorebird species using extensive field data (>200,000 observations). We show birds in hot, tropical northern Australia have longer bills and smaller bodies than conspecifics in temperate, southern Australia, conforming with both ecogeographical rules. This pattern is consistent across ecologically diverse species, including migratory birds that spend early life in the Arctic. Our findings best support the hypothesis that thermoregulatory adaptation to warm climates drives latitudinal patterns in shorebird size and shape.","Global patterns in animal size and shape have been long observed, but their underlying drivers are not well understood. Here the authors suggest latitudinal patterns in shorebird size and shape are best explained by thermal adaptation to warm climates.",2022-08-11
811,Circular RNA circTmem241 drives group III innate lymphoid cell differentiation via initiation of Elk3 transcription,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) exert important roles in host defense, tissue repair and inflammatory diseases. However, how ILC lineage specification is regulated remains largely elusive. Here we identify that circular RNA circTmem241 is highly expressed in group III innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and their progenitor cells. CircTmem241 deficiency impairs ILC3 commitment and attenuates anti-bacterial immunity. Mechanistically, circTmem241 interacts with Nono protein to recruit histone methyltransferase Ash1l onto Elk3 promoter in ILC progenitor cells (ILCPs). Ash1l-mediated histone modifications on Elk3 promoter enhance chromatin accessibility to initiate Elk3 transcription. Of note, circTmem241−/−, Nono−/− and Ash1l−/− ILCPs display impaired ILC3 differentiation, while Elk3 overexpression rescues ILC3 commitment ability. Finally, circTmem241−/−Elk3−/− mice show lower numbers of ILC3s and are more susceptible to bacterial infection. We reveal that the circTmem241-Nono-Ash1l-Elk3 axis is required for the ILCP differentiation into ILC3P and ILC3 maturation, which is important to manipulate this axis for ILC development on treatment of infectious diseases.",Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) have been shown to be involved in a range of inflammatory contexts but how their cellular lineage is regulated is not fully established. Here the authors show a role for circular RNA circTmem241 in the differentiation of ILC3 via initiation of Elk3 transcription.,2022-08-11
812,"Dearomative di- and trifunctionalization of aryl sulfoxides via [5,5]-rearrangement","Aromatic [5,5]-rearrangement can in principle be an ideal protocol to access dearomative compounds. However, the lack of competent [5,5]-rearrangement impedes the advance of the protocol. In this Article, we showcase the power of [5,5]-rearrangement recently developed in our laboratory for constructing an intriguing dearomative sulfonium specie which features versatile and unique reactivities to perform nucleophilic 1,2- and 1,4-addition and cyclization, thus achieving dearomative di- and trifunctionalization of easily accessible aryl sulfoxides. Impressively, the dearomatization products can be readily converted to sulfur-removed cyclohexenones, naphthalenones, bicyclic cyclohexadienones, and multi-substituted benzenes. Mechanistic studies shed light on the key intermediates and the remarkable chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivities of the reactions.","In contrast with well-established dearomatization protocols such as the Birch reduction, sigmatropic rearrangement-based dearomatizations are a less-explored but potentially effective route to saturated compounds. Here, the authors show a [5,5]-rearrangement-enabled dearomatization of aryl sulfoxides.",2022-08-11
813,Functional control of oscillator networks,"Oscillatory activity is ubiquitous in natural and engineered network systems. The interaction scheme underlying interdependent oscillatory components governs the emergence of network-wide patterns of synchrony that regulate and enable complex functions. Yet, understanding, and ultimately harnessing, the structure-function relationship in oscillator networks remains an outstanding challenge of modern science. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a principled method to prescribe exact and robust functional configurations from local network interactions through optimal tuning of the oscillators’ parameters. To quantify the behavioral synchrony between coupled oscillators, we introduce the notion of functional pattern, which encodes the pairwise relationships between the oscillators’ phases. Our procedure is computationally efficient and provably correct, accounts for constrained interaction types, and allows to concurrently assign multiple desired functional patterns. Further, we derive algebraic and graph-theoretic conditions to guarantee the feasibility and stability of target functional patterns. These conditions provide an interpretable mapping between the structural constraints and their functional implications in oscillator networks. As a proof of concept, we apply the proposed method to replicate empirically recorded functional relationships from cortical oscillations in a human brain, and to redistribute the active power flow in different models of electrical grids.","In network systems governed by oscillatory activity, such as brain networks or power grids, configurations of synchrony may define network functions. The authors introduce a control approach for the formation of desired synchrony patterns through optimal interventions on the network parameters.",2022-08-11
814,Clonal diversification and histogenesis of malignant germ cell tumours,"Germ cell tumours (GCTs) are a collection of benign and malignant neoplasms derived from primordial germ cells. They are uniquely able to recapitulate embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, which carries prognostic and therapeutic significance. The developmental pathways underpinning GCT initiation and histogenesis are incompletely understood. Here, we study the relationship of histogenesis and clonal diversification in GCTs by analysing the genomes and transcriptomes of 547 microdissected histological units. We find no correlation between genomic and histological heterogeneity. However, we identify unifying features including the retention of fetal developmental transcripts across tissues, expression changes on chromosome 12p, and a conserved somatic evolutionary sequence of whole genome duplication followed by clonal diversification. While this pattern is preserved across all GCTs, the developmental timing of the duplication varies between prepubertal and postpubertal cases. In addition, tumours of younger children exhibit distinct substitution signatures which may lend themselves as potential biomarkers for risk stratification. Our findings portray the extensive diversification of GCT tissues and genetic subclones as randomly distributed, while identifying overarching transcriptional and genomic features.","The molecular characterisation of germ cell tumours (GCT) is necessary to understand their development and histological diversification. Here, the authors use whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of GCTs across distinct histologies to reveal their somatic evolution and clonal diversification, as well as identify several putative biomarkers for treatment stratification.",2022-08-11
815,Ultra-deep sequencing validates safety of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells,"As CRISPR-based therapies enter the clinic, evaluation of safety remains a critical and active area of study. Here, we employ a clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) workflow to achieve high sequencing depth and detect ultra-low frequency variants across exons of genes associated with cancer, all exons, and genome wide. In three separate primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) donors assessed in technical triplicates, we electroporated high-fidelity Cas9 protein targeted to three loci (AAVS1, HBB, and ZFPM2) and harvested genomic DNA at days 4 and 10. Our results demonstrate that clinically relevant delivery of high-fidelity Cas9 to primary HSPCs and ex vivo culture up to 10 days does not introduce or enrich for tumorigenic variants and that even a single SNP in a gRNA spacer sequence is sufficient to eliminate Cas9 off-target activity in primary, repair-competent human HSPCs.","As CRISPR-based therapies enter the clinic, evaluation of safety remains a critical and active area of study.

816,Restructured membrane contacts rewire organelles for human cytomegalovirus infection,"Membrane contact sites (MCSs) link organelles to coordinate cellular functions across space and time. Although viruses remodel organelles for their replication cycles, MCSs remain largely unexplored during infections. Here, we design a targeted proteomics platform for measuring MCS proteins at all organelles simultaneously and define functional virus-driven MCS alterations by the ancient beta-herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Integration with super-resolution microscopy and comparisons to herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), Influenza A, and beta-coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infections reveals time-sensitive contact regulation that allows switching anti- to pro-viral organelle functions. We uncover a stabilized mitochondria-ER encapsulation structure (MENC). As HCMV infection progresses, MENCs become the predominant mitochondria-ER contact phenotype and sequentially recruit the tethering partners VAP-B and PTPIP51, supporting virus production. However, premature ER-mitochondria tethering activates STING and interferon response, priming cells against infection. At peroxisomes, ACBD5-mediated ER contacts balance peroxisome proliferation versus membrane expansion, with ACBD5 impacting the titers of each virus tested.","Membrane contact sites link organelles to coordinate cell functions. Comparing herpesvirus, influenza, and coronavirus infections, the authors define the virus-driven rewiring of organelle contact sites, uncovering ER-mitochondria encapsulation structures as well as a role for ER contacts in pro-viral peroxisome remodeling.",2022-08-11
817,Transcription-coupled and epigenome-encoded mechanisms direct H3K4 methylation,"Mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2/3) are associated with transcription, yet it remains controversial whether H3K4me1/2/3 promote or result from transcription. Our previous characterizations of Arabidopsis H3K4 demethylases suggest roles for H3K4me1 in transcription. However, the control of H3K4me1 remains unexplored in Arabidopsis, in which no methyltransferase for H3K4me1 has been identified. Here, we identify three Arabidopsis methyltransferases that direct H3K4me1. Analyses of their genome-wide localization using ChIP-seq and machine learning reveal that one of the enzymes cooperates with the transcription machinery, while the other two are associated with specific histone modifications and DNA sequences. Importantly, these two types of localization patterns are also found for the other H3K4 methyltransferases in Arabidopsis and mice. These results suggest that H3K4me1/2/3 are established and maintained via interplay with transcription as well as inputs from other chromatin features, presumably enabling elaborate gene control.",Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 is associated with transcription. Here the authors describe three Arabidopsis methyltransferases that direct H3K4me1 and propose that one methyltransferase works co-transcriptionally while the others are recruited to genomic and epigenomic features.,2022-08-11
818,CHIKV infection reprograms codon optimality to favor viral RNA translation by altering the tRNA epitranscriptome,"Ample evidence indicates that codon usage bias regulates gene expression. How viruses, such as the emerging mosquito-borne Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), express their genomes at high levels despite an enrichment in rare codons remains a puzzling question. Using ribosome footprinting, we analyze translational changes that occur upon CHIKV infection. We show that CHIKV infection induces codon-specific reprogramming of the host translation machinery to favor the translation of viral RNA genomes over host mRNAs with an otherwise optimal codon usage. This reprogramming was mostly apparent at the endoplasmic reticulum, where CHIKV RNAs show high ribosome occupancy. Mechanistically, it involves CHIKV-induced overexpression of KIAA1456, an enzyme that modifies the wobble U34 position in the anticodon of tRNAs, which is required for proper decoding of codons that are highly enriched in CHIKV RNAs. Our findings demonstrate an unprecedented interplay of viruses with the host tRNA epitranscriptome to adapt the host translation machinery to viral production.","Viruses completely depend on the host translational machinery, but their genomes are often enriched in rare codons and therefore should be translated with poor efficiency. Here, Jungfleisch et al. apply Ribo-Seq and RNASeq to provide a global view on the translational changes occurring during Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection. CHIKV infection induces a codon-specific reprogramming of the host translation machinery to favor the translation of viral RNA genomes over host mRNAs via tRNA modification.",2022-08-11
819,Comparative immunogenicity and reactogenicity of heterologous ChAdOx1-nCoV-19-priming and BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273-boosting with homologous COVID-19 vaccine regimens,"Comparative analyses of the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-regimens will inform optimized vaccine strategies. Here we analyze the humoral and cellular immune response following heterologous and homologous vaccination strategies in a convenience cohort of 331 healthy individuals. All regimens induce immunity to the vaccine antigen. Immunity after vaccination with ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 followed by either BNT162b2 (n = 66) or mRNA-1273 (n = 101) is equivalent to or more pronounced than homologous mRNA-regimens (n = 43 BNT162b2, n = 59 mRNA-1273) or homologous ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 vaccination (n = 62). We note highest levels of spike-specific CD8 T-cells following both heterologous regimens. Among mRNA-containing combinations, spike-specific CD4 T-cell levels in regimens including mRNA-1273 are higher than respective combinations with BNT162b2. Polyfunctional T-cell levels are highest in regimens based on ChAdOx1-nCoV-19-priming. All five regimens are well tolerated with most pronounced reactogenicity upon ChAdOx1-nCoV-19-priming, and ChAdOx1-nCoV-19/mRNA-1273-boosting. In conclusion, we present comparative analyses of immunogenicity and reactogenicity for heterologous vector/mRNA-boosting and homologous mRNA-regimens.",Multiple formulations and technologies for vaccinating against SARS-CoV-2 exist but how the use of these in homologous or heterologous format impacts immunogenicity is far from clear. Here the authors compare a range of heterologous and homologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies and assess the induced humoral and cellular immune response.,2022-08-11
820,Megahertz pulse trains enable multi-hit serial femtosecond crystallography experiments at X-ray free electron lasers,"The European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) and Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) II are extremely intense sources of X-rays capable of generating Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SFX) data at megahertz (MHz) repetition rates. Previous work has shown that it is possible to use consecutive X-ray pulses to collect diffraction patterns from individual crystals. Here, we exploit the MHz pulse structure of the European XFEL to obtain two complete datasets from the same lysozyme crystal, first hit and the second hit, before it exits the beam. The two datasets, separated by <1 µs, yield up to 2.1 Å resolution structures. Comparisons between the two structures reveal no indications of radiation damage or significant changes within the active site, consistent with the calculated dose estimates. This demonstrates MHz SFX can be used as a tool for tracking sub-microsecond structural changes in individual single crystals, a technique we refer to as multi-hit SFX.",Free-electron lasers are capable of high repetition rates and it is assumed that protein crystals often do not survive the first X-ray pulse. Here the authors address these issues with a demonstration of multi-hit serial crystallography in which multiple FEL pulses interact with the sample without destroying it.,2022-08-11
821,Adenosine triphosphate-activated prodrug system for on-demand bacterial inactivation and wound disinfection,"The prodrug approach has emerged as a promising solution to combat bacterial resistance and enhance treatment efficacy against bacterial infections. Here, we report an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-activated prodrug system for on-demand treatment of bacterial infection. The prodrug system benefits from the synergistic action of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 and polyacrylamide hydrogel microsphere, which simultaneously transports indole-3-acetic acid and horseradish peroxidase in a single carrier while preventing the premature activation of indole-3-acetic acid. The ATP-responsive characteristic of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 allows the prodrug system to be activated by the ATP secreted by bacteria to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), displaying exceptional broad-spectrum antimicrobial ability. Upon disruption of the bacterial membrane by ROS, the leaked intracellular ATP from dead bacteria can accelerate the activation of the prodrug system to further enhance antibacterial efficiency. In vivo experiments in a mouse model demonstrates the applicability of the prodrug system for wound disinfection with minimal side effects.","Prodrugs are increasingly promising in tackling bacterial resistance and efficacy of treatment. Here, the authors encapsulated horseradish peroxidase and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 loaded with indole-3-acetic acid in polyacrylamide hydrogel microspheres for ATP-activated wound disinfection.",2022-08-11
822,SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens are detected in continuous air samples from congregate settings,"Two years after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, there is still a need for better ways to assess the risk of transmission in congregate spaces. We deployed active air samplers to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in real-world settings across communities in the Upper Midwestern states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Over 29 weeks, we collected 527 air samples from 15 congregate settings. We detected 106 samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in continuous air samples collected from a variety of real-world settings. We expanded the utility of air surveillance to test for 40 other respiratory pathogens. Surveillance data revealed differences in timing and location of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus detection. In addition, we obtained SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from air samples to identify variant lineages. Collectively, this shows air sampling is a scalable, high throughput surveillance tool that could be used in conjunction with other methods for detecting respiratory pathogens in congregate settings.","Air surveillance offers a potential means of monitoring airborne pathogens without the need for individual sampling. Here, the authors perform continuous air sampling in 15 community settings in the US for 29 weeks and demonstrate its feasibility for routine detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.",2022-08-11
823,PTEN inhibits AMPK to control collective migration,"Pten is one of the most frequently mutated tumour suppressor gene in cancer. PTEN is generally altered in invasive cancers such as glioblastomas, but its function in collective cell migration and invasion is not fully characterised. Herein, we report that the loss of PTEN increases cell speed during collective migration of non-tumourous cells both in vitro and in vivo. We further show that loss of PTEN promotes LKB1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of the major metabolic regulator AMPK. In turn AMPK increases VASP phosphorylation, reduces VASP localisation at cell-cell junctions and decreases the interjunctional transverse actin arcs at the leading front, provoking a weakening of cell-cell contacts and increasing migration speed. Targeting AMPK activity not only slows down PTEN-depleted cells, it also limits PTEN-null glioblastoma cell invasion, opening new opportunities to treat glioblastoma lethal invasiveness.","Pten is a tumour suppressor gene that is associated with highly invasive cancers such as glioblastoma. Here the authors show that PTEN loss results in increased migratory behaviour, which can be countered by targeting AMPK activity.",2022-08-11
824,TET enzymes regulate skeletal development through increasing chromatin accessibility of RUNX2 target genes,"The Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases mediate cytosine demethylation by catalyzing the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC). TET-mediated DNA demethylation controls the proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells and TET members display functional redundancy during early gastrulation. However, it is unclear if TET proteins have functional significance in mammalian skeletal development. Here, we report that Tet genes deficiency in mesoderm mesenchymal stem cells results in severe defects of bone development. The existence of any single Tet gene allele can support early bone formation, suggesting a functional redundancy of TET proteins. Integrative analyses of RNA-seq, Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), 5hmC-Seal and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) demonstrate that TET-mediated demethylation increases the chromatin accessibility of target genes by RUNX2 and facilities RUNX2-regulated transcription. In addition, TET proteins interact with RUNX2 through their catalytic domain to regulate cytosine methylation around RUNX2 binding region. The catalytic domain is indispensable for TET enzymes to regulate RUNX2 transcription activity on its target genes and to regulate bone development. These results demonstrate that TET enzymes function to regulate RUNX2 activity and maintain skeletal homeostasis.","Here the authors investigate the role of the TET family of DNA demethylases in mammalian skeletal development. They find that loss of TETs leads to hypermethylation that results in decreased chromatin accessibility of RUNX2 target genes, repressing osteoblast differentiation and leading to skeletal defects in mouse such as short limbs.",2022-08-11
825,Rational highly dispersed ruthenium for reductive catalytic fractionation of lignocellulose,"Producing monomeric phenols from lignin biopolymer depolymerization in a detachable and efficient manner comes under the spotlight on the fullest utilization of sustainable lignocellulosic biomass. Here, we report a low-loaded and highly dispersed Ru anchored on a chitosan-derived N-doped carbon catalyst (RuN/ZnO/C), which exhibits outstanding performance in the reductive catalytic fractionation of lignocellulose. Nearly theoretical maximum yields of phenolic monomers from lignin are achieved, corresponding to TON as 431 molphenols molRu−1, 20 times higher than that from commercial Ru/C catalyst; high selectivity toward propyl end-chained guaiacol and syringol allow them to be readily purified. The RCF leave high retention of (hemi)cellulose amenable to enzymatic hydrolysis due to the successful breakdown of biomass recalcitrance. The RuN/ZnO/C catalyst shows good stability in recycling experiments as well as after a harsh hydrothermal treatment, benefiting from the coordination of Ru species with N atoms. Characterizations of the RuN/ZnO/C imply a transformation from Ru single atoms to nanoclusters under current reaction conditions. Time-course experiment, as well as reactivity screening of a series of lignin model compounds, offer insight into the mechanism of current RCF over RuN/ZnO/C. This work opens a new opportunity for achieving the valuable aromatic products from lignin and promoting the industrial economic feasibility of lignocellulosic biomass.","Lignin valorization becomes the spotlight on the full utilization of biomass. Here, the authors report a highly dispersed Ru catalyst for reductive catalytic fractionation of lignocellulose, which affords monophenols in theoretical maximum yields, along with high preservation of carbohydrate.",2022-08-11
826,Thermodynamics of high-pressure ice phases explored with atomistic simulations,"Most experimentally known high-pressure ice phases have a body-centred cubic (bcc) oxygen lattice. Our large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations with a machine-learning potential indicate that, amongst these bcc ice phases, ices VII, VII′ and X are the same thermodynamic phase under different conditions, whereas superionic ice VII″ has a first-order phase boundary with ice VII′. Moreover, at about 300 GPa, the transformation between ice X and the Pbcm phase has a sharp structural change but no apparent activation barrier, whilst at higher pressures the barrier gradually increases. Our study thus clarifies the phase behaviour of the high-pressure ices and reveals peculiar solid–solid transition mechanisms not known in other systems.",Many experimentally known high-pressure ice phase are structurally very similar. Here authors elucidate the phase behaviour of the high-pressure insulating ices and reveal solid-solid transition mechanisms not known in other systems.,2022-08-10
827,mTORC1 controls Golgi architecture and vesicle secretion by phosphorylation of SCYL1,"The protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of cell growth and proliferation, supporting anabolic reactions and inhibiting catabolic pathways like autophagy. Its hyperactivation is a frequent event in cancer promoting tumor cell proliferation. Several intracellular membrane-associated mTORC1 pools have been identified, linking its function to distinct subcellular localizations. Here, we characterize the N-terminal kinase-like protein SCYL1 as a Golgi-localized target through which mTORC1 controls organelle distribution and extracellular vesicle secretion in breast cancer cells. Under growth conditions, SCYL1 is phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser754, supporting Golgi localization. Upon mTORC1 inhibition, Ser754 dephosphorylation leads to SCYL1 displacement to endosomes. Peripheral, dephosphorylated SCYL1 causes Golgi enlargement, redistribution of early and late endosomes and increased extracellular vesicle release. Thus, the mTORC1-controlled phosphorylation status of SCYL1 is an important determinant regulating subcellular distribution and function of endolysosomal compartments. It may also explain the pathophysiology underlying human genetic diseases such as CALFAN syndrome, which is caused by loss-of-function of SCYL1.","mTORC1 is a master regulator of cell growth with well-known functions in inhibiting autophagic vesicle formation. Here, the authors show that mTORC1 also affects Golgi architecture and vesicle secretion by phosphorylating the scaffold protein SCYL1.",2022-08-10
828,Conserved subcortical processing in visuo-vestibular gaze control,"Gaze stabilization compensates for movements of the head or external environment to minimize image blurring. Multisensory information stabilizes the scene on the retina via the vestibulo-ocular (VOR) and optokinetic (OKR) reflexes. While the organization of neuronal circuits underlying VOR is well-described across vertebrates, less is known about the contribution and evolution of the OKR and the basic structures allowing visuo-vestibular integration. To analyze these neuronal pathways underlying visuo-vestibular integration, we developed a setup using a lamprey eye-brain-labyrinth preparation, which allowed coordinating electrophysiological recordings, vestibular stimulation with a moving platform, and visual stimulation via screens. Lampreys exhibit robust visuo-vestibular integration, with optokinetic information processed in the pretectum that can be downregulated from tectum. Visual and vestibular inputs are integrated at several subcortical levels. Additionally, saccades are present in the form of nystagmus. Thus, all basic components of the visuo-vestibular control of gaze were present already at the dawn of vertebrate evolution.","Here, the authors show that gaze stabilization relies on a visuo-vestibular network conserved from lamprey to primates. This primordial blueprint highlights how visual and vestibular streams are organized to control fundamental aspects of eye movements.",2022-08-10
829,Evidence for a HURP/EB free mixed-nucleotide zone in kinetochore-microtubules,"Current models infer that the microtubule-based mitotic spindle is built from GDP-tubulin with small GTP caps at microtubule plus-ends, including those that attach to kinetochores, forming the kinetochore-fibres. Here we reveal that kinetochore-fibres additionally contain a dynamic mixed-nucleotide zone that reaches several microns in length. This zone becomes visible in cells expressing fluorescently labelled end-binding proteins, a known marker for GTP-tubulin, and endogenously-labelled HURP - a protein which we show to preferentially bind the GDP microtubule lattice in vitro and in vivo. We find that in mitotic cells HURP accumulates on the kinetochore-proximal region of depolymerising kinetochore-fibres, whilst avoiding recruitment to nascent polymerising K-fibres, giving rise to a growing “HURP-gap”. The absence of end-binding proteins in the HURP-gaps leads us to postulate that they reflect a mixed-nucleotide zone. We generate a minimal quantitative model based on the preferential binding of HURP to GDP-tubulin to show that such a mixed-nucleotide zone is sufficient to recapitulate the observed in vivo dynamics of HURP-gaps.","Microtubules are built from GDP-tubulin lattices with small GTP caps at their plus-ends. Here, the authors reveal that microtubules that attach to kinetochores in mitosis contain, in addition to the GTP-cap and the GDP-lattices, a dynamic micron-sized mixed-nucleotide zone.",2022-08-10
830,A distributed nanocluster based multi-agent evolutionary network,"As an important approach of distributed artificial intelligence, multi-agent system provides an efficient way to solve large-scale computational problems through high-parallelism processing with nonlinear interactions between the agents. However, the huge capacity and complex distribution of the individual agents make it difficult for efficient hardware construction. Here, we propose and demonstrate a multi-agent hardware system that deploys distributed Ag nanoclusters as physical agents and their electrochemical dissolution, growth and evolution dynamics under electric field for high-parallelism exploration of the solution space. The collaboration and competition between the Ag nanoclusters allow information to be effectively expressed and processed, which therefore replaces cumbrous exhaustive operations with self-organization of Ag physical network based on the positive feedback of information interaction, leading to significantly reduced computational complexity. The proposed multi-agent network can be scaled up with parallel and serial integration structures, and demonstrates efficient solution of graph and optimization problems. An artificial potential field with superimposed attractive/repulsive components and varied ion velocity is realized, showing gradient descent route planning with self-adaptive obstacle avoidance. This multi-agent network is expected to serve as a physics-empowered parallel computing hardware.","Designing an efficient multi-agent hardware system to solve large-scale computational problems through high-parallelism processing with nonlinear interactions remains a challenge. Here, the authors demonstrate that a multi-agent hardware system deploying distributed Ag nanoclusters as physical agents enables parallel, complex computing.",2022-08-10
831,Targeting the Retinoblastoma/E2F repressive complex by CDK4/6 inhibitors amplifies oncolytic potency of an oncolytic adenovirus,"CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) and oncolytic viruses are promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of various cancers. As single agents, CDK4/6 inhibitors that are approved for the treatment of breast cancer in combination with endocrine therapy cause G1 cell cycle arrest, whereas adenoviruses induce progression into S-phase in infected cells as an integral part of the their life cycle. Both CDK4/6 inhibitors and adenovirus replication target the Retinoblastoma protein albeit for different purposes. Here we show that in combination CDK4/6 inhibitors potentiate the anti-tumor effect of the oncolytic adenovirus XVir-N-31 in bladder cancer and murine Ewing sarcoma xenograft models. This increase in oncolytic potency correlates with an increase in virus-producing cancer cells, enhanced viral genome replication, particle formation and consequently cancer cell killing. The molecular mechanism that regulates this response is fundamentally based on the reduction of Retinoblastoma protein expression levels by CDK4/6 inhibitors.","Neither CDK4/6 inhibitors nor oncolytic adenoviruses show high efficiency as monotherapy in the treatment of cancer. Authors show here that when combined, CDK4/6 inhibitors deplete Retinoblastoma protein levels, which leads to more efficient virus replication and an increase in oncolytic virus-producing cancer cells and thus to efficient anti-tumor response in mouse xenograft sarcoma models.",2022-08-10
832,PRC1-mediated epigenetic programming is required to generate the ovarian reserve,"The ovarian reserve defines the female reproductive lifespan, which in humans spans decades due to robust maintenance of meiotic arrest in oocytes residing in primordial follicles. Epigenetic reprogramming, including DNA demethylation, accompanies meiotic entry, but the chromatin changes that underpin the generation and preservation of ovarian reserves are poorly defined. We report that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) establishes repressive chromatin states in perinatal mouse oocytes that directly suppress the gene expression program of meiotic prophase-I and thereby enable the transition to dictyate arrest. PRC1 dysfuction causes depletion of the ovarian reserve and leads to premature ovarian failure. Our study demonstrates a fundamental role for PRC1-mediated gene silencing in female reproductive lifespan, and reveals a critical window of epigenetic programming required to establish ovarian reserve.","In humans, the ovarian reserve is maintained over decades by meiotic arrest of oocytes. Here the authors show that Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1)-mediated epigenetic programming is essential for formation of ovarian reserve and thus female reproductive lifespan.",2022-08-10
833,Molecular characterization of the missing electron pathways for butanol synthesis in Clostridium acetobutylicum,"Clostridium acetobutylicum is a promising biocatalyst for the renewable production of n-butanol. Several metabolic strategies have already been developed to increase butanol yields, most often based on carbon pathway redirection. However, it has previously demonstrated that the activities of both ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase and ferredoxin-NAD+ reductase, whose encoding genes remain unknown, are necessary to produce the NADPH and the extra NADH needed for butanol synthesis under solventogenic conditions. Here, we purify, identify and partially characterize the proteins responsible for both activities and demonstrate the involvement of the identified enzymes in butanol synthesis through a reverse genetic approach. We further demonstrate the yield of butanol formation is limited by the level of expression of CA_C0764, the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase encoding gene and the bcd operon, encoding a ferredoxin-NAD+ reductase. The integration of these enzymes into metabolic engineering strategies introduces opportunities for developing a homobutanologenic C. acetobutylicum strain.","Ferredoxin-NAD(P) + oxidoreductases are important enzymes for redox balancing in n-butanol production by Clostridium acetobutylicum, but the encoding genes remain unknown. Here, the authors identify the long sought-after genes and increase n-butanol production by optimizing the levels of the two enzymes.",2022-08-10
834,Molecular basis of MHC I quality control in the peptide loading complex,"Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules are central to adaptive immunity. Their assembly, epitope selection, and antigen presentation are controlled by the MHC I glycan through a sophisticated network of chaperones and modifying enzymes. However, the mechanistic integration of the corresponding processes remains poorly understood. Here, we determine the multi-chaperone-client interaction network of the peptide loading complex (PLC) and report the PLC editing module structure by cryogenic electron microscopy at 3.7 Å resolution. Combined with epitope-proofreading studies of the PLC in near-native lipid environment, these data show that peptide-receptive MHC I molecules are stabilized by multivalent chaperone interactions including the calreticulin-engulfed mono-glucosylated MHC I glycan, which only becomes accessible for processing by α-glucosidase II upon loading of optimal epitopes. Our work reveals allosteric coupling between peptide-MHC I assembly and glycan processing. This inter-process communication defines the onset of an adaptive immune response and provides a prototypical example of the tightly coordinated events in endoplasmic reticulum quality control.","The immune system monitors the health status of cells by surveilling fragments of foreign molecules from invaders presented on MHC I complexes at the cell surface. Here, the authors investigate the sequence of events of MHC I assembly and quality control cycle.",2022-08-10
835,N-Heterocyclic carbene-based C-centered Au(I)-Ag(I) clusters with intense phosphorescence and organelle-selective translocation in cells,"Photoluminescent gold clusters are functionally variable chemical modules by ligand design. Chemical modification of protective ligands and introduction of different metals into the gold clusters lead to discover unique chemical and physical properties based on their significantly perturbed electronic structures. Here we report the synthesis of carbon-centered Au(I)-Ag(I) clusters with high phosphorescence quantum yields using N-heterocyclic carbene ligands. Specifically, a heterometallic cluster [(C)(AuI-L)6AgI2]4+, where L denotes benzimidazolylidene-based carbene ligands featuring N-pyridyl substituents, shows a significantly high phosphorescence quantum yield (Φ = 0.88). Theoretical calculations suggest that the carbene ligands accelerate the radiative decay by affecting the spin-orbit coupling, and the benzimidazolylidene ligands further suppress the non-radiative pathway. Furthermore, these clusters with carbene ligands are taken up into cells, emit phosphorescence and translocate to a particular organelle. Such well-defined, highly phosphorescent C-centered Au(I)-Ag(I) clusters will enable ligand-specific, organelle-selective phosphorescence imaging and dynamic analysis of molecular distribution and translocation pathways in cells.","Photoluminescent gold clusters have unique chemical and physical properties based on their perturbed electronic structures.

836,Neuronal congruency effects in macaque prefrontal cortex,"The interplay between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information may induce conflicts that impair behavioral performance, a.k.a. behavioral congruency effects. The neuronal mechanisms underlying behavioral congruency effects, however, are poorly understood. We recorded single unit activity in monkey prefrontal cortex using a task-switching paradigm and discovered a neuronal congruency effect (NCE) that is carried by target and distractor neurons which process target and distractor-related information, respectively. The former neurons provide more signal, the latter less noise in congruent compared to incongruent conditions, resulting in a better target representation. Such NCE is dominated by the level of congruency, and is not determined by the task rules the subjects used, their reaction times (RT), the length of the delay period, nor the response levels of the neurons. We propose that this NCE can explain behavioral congruency effects in general, as well as previous fMRI and EEG results in various conflict paradigms.","Stimulus-induced conflicts impair behavior in conflict tasks resulting in a phenomenon known as the behavioral congruency effect. Here, the authors investigate the neural underpinnings of this phenomenon and report a neuronal congruency effect in macaque prefrontal cortex to explain this impairment.",2022-08-10
837,Omicron BA.4/BA.5 escape neutralizing immunity elicited by BA.1 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) BA.4 and BA.5 sub-lineages, first detected in South Africa, have changes relative to Omicron BA.1 including substitutions in the spike receptor binding domain. Here we isolated live BA.4 and BA.5 viruses and measured BA.4/BA.5 neutralization elicited by BA.1 infection either in the absence or presence of previous vaccination as well as from vaccination without BA.1 infection. In BA.1-infected unvaccinated individuals, neutralization relative to BA.1 declines 7.6-fold for BA.4 and 7.5-fold for BA.5. In vaccinated individuals with subsequent BA.1 infection, neutralization relative to BA.1 decreases 3.2-fold for BA.4 and 2.6-fold for BA.5. The fold-drop versus ancestral virus neutralization in this group is 4.0-fold for BA.1, 12.9-fold for BA.4, and 10.3-fold for BA.5. In contrast, BA.4/BA.5 escape is similar to BA.1 in the absence of BA.1 elicited immunity: fold-drop relative to ancestral virus neutralization is 19.8-fold for BA.1, 19.6-fold for BA.4, and 20.9-fold for BA.5. These results show considerable escape of BA.4/BA.5 from BA.1 elicited immunity which is moderated with vaccination and may indicate that BA.4/BA.5 may have the strongest selective advantage in evading neutralization relative to BA.1 in unvaccinated, BA.1 infected individuals.","Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sub-lineages BA.4 and BA.5 raise concerns about potential immune evasion. Here, Khan et al. show that both BA.4 and BA.5 are able to escape immune response induced by prior BA.1 infection, but that this effect is less pronounced in vaccinated individuals.",2022-08-10
838,Identification of a HTT-specific binding motif in DNAJB1 essential for suppression and disaggregation of HTT,"Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded polyQ stretch within Huntingtin (HTT) that renders the protein aggregation-prone, ultimately resulting in the formation of amyloid fibrils. A trimeric chaperone complex composed of Hsc70, DNAJB1 and Apg2 can suppress and reverse the aggregation of HTTExon1Q48. DNAJB1 is the rate-limiting chaperone and we have here identified and characterized the binding interface between DNAJB1 and HTTExon1Q48. DNAJB1 exhibits a HTT binding motif (HBM) in the hinge region between C-terminal domains (CTD) I and II and binds to the polyQ-adjacent proline rich domain (PRD) of soluble as well as aggregated HTT. The PRD of HTT represents an additional binding site for chaperones. Mutation of the highly conserved H244 of the HBM of DNAJB1 completely abrogates the suppression and disaggregation of HTT fibrils by the trimeric chaperone complex. Notably, this mutation does not affect the binding and remodeling of any other protein substrate, suggesting that the HBM of DNAJB1 is a specific interaction site for HTT. Overexpression of wt DNAJB1, but not of DNAJB1H244A can prevent the accumulation of HTTExon1Q97 aggregates in HEK293 cells, thus validating the biological significance of the HBM within DNAJB1.",Ayala Mariscal et al have identified and characterized the interface of pathogenic Huntingtin and the molecular chaperone DNAJB1. Histidine-244 of the C-terminal domain of DNAJB1 is a key residues for binding to the poly-proline region of HTT. This binding site is specific for the interaction with Huntingtin.,2022-08-10
839,Entanglement of orbital angular momentum in non-sequential double ionization,"Entanglement has a capacity to enhance imaging procedures, but this remains unexplored for attosecond imaging. Here, we elucidate that possibility, addressing orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement in ultrafast processes. In the correlated process non-sequential double ionization (NSDI) we demonstrate robust photoelectron entanglement. In contrast to commonly considered continuous variables, the discrete OAM allows for a simpler interpretation, computation, and measurement of entanglement. The logarithmic negativity reveals that the entanglement is robust to incoherence and an entanglement witness minimizes the number of measurements to detect the entanglement, both quantities are related to OAM coherence terms. We quantify the entanglement for a range of targets and field parameters to find the most entangled photoelectron pairs. This methodology provides a general way to use OAM to quantify and measure entanglement, well-suited to attosecond processes, and can be exploited to enhance imaging capabilities through correlated measurements, or for generation of OAM-entangled electrons.","In strong field ionization, entanglement between an electron and an ion has been discussed previously. Here the authors explore orbital angular momentum entanglement between the electrons released in non-sequential double ionization.",2022-08-10
840,Local molecular and global connectomic contributions to cross-disorder cortical abnormalities,"Numerous brain disorders demonstrate structural brain abnormalities, which are thought to arise from molecular perturbations or connectome miswiring. The unique and shared contributions of these molecular and connectomic vulnerabilities to brain disorders remain unknown, and has yet to be studied in a single multi-disorder framework. Using MRI morphometry from the ENIGMA consortium, we construct maps of cortical abnormalities for thirteen neurodevelopmental, neurological, and psychiatric disorders from N = 21,000 participants and N = 26,000 controls, collected using a harmonised processing protocol. We systematically compare cortical maps to multiple micro-architectural measures, including gene expression, neurotransmitter density, metabolism, and myelination (molecular vulnerability), as well as global connectomic measures including number of connections, centrality, and connection diversity (connectomic vulnerability). We find a relationship between molecular vulnerability and white-matter architecture that drives cortical disorder profiles. Local attributes, particularly neurotransmitter receptor profiles, constitute the best predictors of both disorder-specific cortical morphology and cross-disorder similarity. Finally, we find that cross-disorder abnormalities are consistently subtended by a small subset of network epicentres in bilateral sensory-motor, inferior temporal lobe, precuneus, and superior parietal cortex. Collectively, our results highlight how local molecular attributes and global connectivity jointly shape cross-disorder cortical abnormalities.","Changes to structural and functional connectivity can give rise to neurodegeneration and neurodevelopmental diseases.

841,Phase-selective recrystallization makes eutectic high-entropy alloys ultra-ductile,Excellent ductility is crucial not only for shaping but also for strengthening metals and alloys. The ever most widely used eutectic alloys are suffering from the limited ductility and losing competitiveness among advanced structural materials. Here we report a distinctive concept of phase-selective recrystallization to overcome this challenge for eutectic alloys by triggering the strain hardening capacity of the duplex phases completely. We manipulate the strain partitioning behavior of the two phases in a eutectic high-entropy alloy (EHEA) to obtain the phase-selectively recrystallized microstructure with a fully recrystallized soft phase embedded in the skeleton of a hard phase. The resulting microstructure fully releases the strain hardening capacity in EHEA by eliminating the weak boundaries. Our phase-selectively recrystallized EHEA achieves a high ductility of ∼35% uniform elongation with true stress of ∼2 GPa. This concept is universal for various duplex alloys with soft and hard phases and opens new frontiers for traditional eutectic alloys as high-strength metallic materials.,The ever most widely used eutectic alloys often suffer from limited ductility. Here the authors propose a distinctive concept of phase-selective recrystallization to significantly improve their ductility and strength and pave the way for new applications of the widespread eutectic alloys.,2022-08-10
842,Embedded metallic nanoparticles facilitate metastability of switchable metallic domains in Mott threshold switches,"Mott threshold switching, which is observed in quantum materials featuring an electrically fired insulator-to-metal transition, calls for delicate control of the percolative dynamics of electrically switchable domains on a nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate that embedded metallic nanoparticles (NP) dramatically promote metastability of switchable metallic domains in single-crystal-like VO2 Mott switches. Using a model system of Pt-NP-VO2 single-crystal-like films, interestingly, the embedded Pt NPs provide 33.3 times longer ‘memory’ of previous threshold metallic conduction by serving as pre-formed ‘stepping-stones’ in the switchable VO2 matrix by consecutive electical pulse measurement; persistent memory of previous firing during the application of sub-threshold pulses was achieved on a six orders of magnitude longer timescale than the single-pulse recovery time of the insulating resistance in Pt-NP-VO2 Mott switches. This discovery offers a fundamental strategy to exploit the geometric evolution of switchable domains in electrically fired transition and potential applications for non-Boolean computing using quantum materials.",Control of percolative dynamics of metal and insulator domains during electrically triggered insulator-metal transition underlies applications in energy-efficient switches.

843,Linking oxidative and reductive clusters to prepare crystalline porous catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O,"Mimicking natural photosynthesis to convert CO2 with H2O into value-added fuels achieving overall reaction is a promising way to reduce the atmospheric CO2 level. Casting the catalyst of two or more catalytic sites with rapid electron transfer and interaction may be an effective strategy for coupling photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation. Herein, based on the MOF ∪ COF collaboration, we have carefully designed and synthesized a crystalline hetero-metallic cluster catalyst denoted MCOF-Ti6Cu3 with spatial separation and functional cooperation between oxidative and reductive clusters. It utilizes dynamic covalent bonds between clusters to promote photo-induced charge separation and transfer efficiency, to drive both the photocatalytic oxidative and reductive reactions. MCOF-Ti6Cu3 exhibits fine activity in the conversion of CO2 with water into HCOOH (169.8 μmol g−1h−1). Remarkably, experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that photo-excited electrons are transferred from Ti to Cu, indicating that the Cu cluster is the catalytic reduction center.",A crystalline hetero-metallic cluster catalyst based on a covalent organic framework strategy is reported. The catalyst can facilitate both photocatalytic oxidative and reductive reactions leading to efficient production of HCOOH from CO2 and H2O.,2022-08-10
844,EGFR-mediated activation of adipose tissue macrophages promotes obesity and insulin resistance,"Obesity and obesity-related health complications are increasing in prevalence. Adipose tissue from obese subjects has low-grade, chronic inflammation, leading to insulin resistance. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are a source of proinflammatory cytokines that further aggravate adipocyte dysfunction. In response to a high fat diet (HFD), ATM numbers initially increase by proliferation of resident macrophages, but subsequent increases also result from infiltration in response to chemotactic signals from inflamed adipose tissue. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms regulating the increases in ATMs and their proinflammatory phenotype, we investigated the role of activation of ATM epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A high fat diet increased expression of EGFR and its ligand amphiregulin in ATMs. Selective deletion of EGFR in ATMs inhibited both resident ATM proliferation and monocyte infiltration into adipose tissue and decreased obesity and development of insulin resistance. Therefore, ATM EGFR activation plays an important role in adipose tissue dysfunction.","In obesity, adipose tissue is chronically inflamed, leading to insulin resistance, and adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are a major source of cytokines that aggravate adipocyte dysfunction. Here, the authors show that selective deletion of the epidermal growth factor receptor in ATMs decreased obesity and development of insulin resistance.",2022-08-10
845,Measuring corporate Paris Compliance using a strict science-based approach,"The achievement of the Paris Agreement climate goals of well-below 2 degrees of warming requires companies to align their greenhouse gas emission reductions with this goal. To measure whether companies are compliant with the Paris targets we propose several strict conditions that any emissions allocation methodology must meet before it can be classified as Paris-Compliant. Our conditions focus on the need for a common, and early as practicable, base year for all companies and consistency with an underlying Paris-aligned decarbonisation pathway. Additionally, we propose four operationalisation requirements to ensure companies can declare they are on a Paris Compliant Pathway including calculations of their carbon budgets and re-alignment pathways. Applying example Paris-Compliant Pathways and associated metrics to ten high emission electric utility companies and ten cement companies, we find that all but one of these companies are not currently Paris-compliant, with every year of delayed action increasing their required rate of decarbonisation and hence the exposure of billions of investment dollars to transition risk. Applying this proposed method will ensure the Paris carbon budget is met and that progress can be tracked accurately - an imperative for any companies and stakeholders seeking to align their decision-making with the Paris Agreement.","New study defines key guidelines to accurately assess the alignment of companies with Paris goals, finding that current methods to evaluate performance are deficient with few companies assessed as Paris Compliant.",2022-08-10

Crystalline-amorphous hybrid structures, combining the advantages of both ordered and disordered components, present a promising opportunity to design materials with emergent collective properties. Hybridization of crystalline and amorphous structures at the sublattice level with long-range periodicity has been rarely observed. Here, we report a nested order-disorder framework (NOF) constructed by a crystalline matrix with self-filled amorphous-like innards that is obtained by using pressure to regulate the bonding hierarchy of Cu12Sb4S13. Combined in situ experimental and computational methods demonstrate the formation of disordered Cu sublattice which is embedded in the retained crystalline Cu framework. Such a NOF structure gives a low thermal conductivity (~0.24 W·m−1·K−1) and a metallic electrical conductivity (8 × 10−6 Ω·m), realizing the collaborative improvement of two competing physical properties. These findings demonstrate a category of solid-state materials to link the crystalline and amorphous forms in the sublattice-scale, which will exhibit extraordinary properties.","The synthesis and characterization of new crystalline-amorphous hybrid materials is challenging. Here, the authors report the preparation of a nested order-disorder framework by applying high pressure to a nested copper chalcogenide Cu12Sb4S13.",2022-08-09
847,Identification of a non-axisymmetric mode in laboratory experiments searching for standard magnetorotational instability,"The standard magnetorotational instability (SMRI) is a promising mechanism for turbulence and rapid accretion in astrophysical disks. It is a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instability that destabilizes otherwise hydrodynamically stable disk flow. Due to its microscopic nature at astronomical distances and stringent requirements in laboratory experiments, SMRI has remained unconfirmed since its proposal, despite its astrophysical importance. Here we report a nonaxisymmetric MHD instability in a modified Taylor-Couette experiment. To search for SMRI, a uniform magnetic field is imposed along the rotation axis of a swirling liquid-metal flow. The instability initially grows exponentially, becoming prominent only for sufficient flow shear and moderate magnetic field. These conditions for instability are qualitatively consistent with SMRI, but at magnetic Reynolds numbers below the predictions of linear analyses with periodic axial boundaries. Three-dimensional numerical simulations, however, reproduce the observed instability, indicating that it grows linearly from the primary axisymmetric flow modified by the applied magnetic field.",Magnetohydrodynamic instabilities are related to different characteristics and behavior of fluids. Here the authors report an experiment and simulation combined study of a global non-axisymmetric MHD instability that exists at sufficiently large rotation rates and intermediate magnetic field strengths.,2022-08-09
848,Synthesis of bioactive (1→6)-β-glucose branched poly-amido-saccharides that stimulate and induce M1 polarization in macrophages,"β-Glucans are of significant interest due to their potent antitumor and immunomodulatory activities. Nevertheless, the difficulty in purification, structural heterogenicity, and limited solubility impede the development of structure-property relationships and translation to therapeutic applications. Here, we report the synthesis of a new class of (1→6)-β-glucose-branched poly-amido-saccharides (PASs) as β-glucan mimetics by ring-opening polymerization of a gentiobiose-based disaccharide β-lactam and its copolymerization with a glucose-based β-lactam, followed by post-polymerization deprotection. The molecular weight (Mn) and frequency of branching (FB) of PASs is readily tuned by adjusting monomer-to-initiator ratio and mole fraction of gentiobiose-lactam in copolymerization. Branched PASs stimulate mouse macrophages, and enhance production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a FB-, dose-, and Mn-dependent manner. The stimulation proceeds via the activation of NF-κB/AP-1 pathway in a Dectin-1-dependent manner, similar to natural β-glucans. The lead PAS significantly polarizes primary human macrophages towards M1 phenotype compared to other β-glucans such as lentinan, laminarin, and curdlan.","Difficulty with purification, structural heterogenicity, and limited water solubility of β-glucans has significantly limited their therapeutic applications. Here, the authors report the synthesis of (1→6)-β-glucose-branched poly-amido-saccharides as glycan-mimetics and demonstrate macrophage stimulation and polarization.",2022-08-09
849,Small-scale fisheries catch more threatened elasmobranchs inside partially protected areas than in unprotected areas,"Elasmobranchs are heavily impacted by fishing. Catch statistics are grossly underestimated due to missing data from various fishery sectors such as small-scale fisheries. Marine Protected Areas are proposed as a tool to protect elasmobranchs and counter their ongoing depletion. We assess elasmobranchs caught in 1,256 fishing operations with fixed nets carried out in partially protected areas within Marine Protected Areas and unprotected areas beyond Marine Protected Areas borders at 11 locations in 6 Mediterranean countries. Twenty-four elasmobranch species were recorded, more than one-third belonging to the IUCN threatened categories (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered). Catches per unit of effort of threatened and data deficient species were higher (with more immature individuals being caught) in partially protected areas than in unprotected areas. Our study suggests that despite partially protected areas having the potential to deliver ecological benefits for threatened elasmobranchs, poor small-scale fisheries management inside Marine Protected Areas could hinder them from achieving this important conservation objective.","Marine protected areas are proposed to protect elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) but the fishing impact from small-scale fisheries in these areas is unknown. From 1256 fishing operations carried out in partially protected and unprotected areas in six Mediterranean countries, this study shows that catches were higher in partially protected areas than in unprotected areas, indicating poor small-scale fisheries management as a threat for these species.",2022-08-09
850,Raptor downregulation rescues neuronal phenotypes in mouse models of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex,"Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which encode proteins that negatively regulate mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Current treatment strategies focus on mTOR inhibition with rapamycin and its derivatives. While effective at improving some aspects of TSC, chronic rapamycin inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 and is associated with systemic side-effects. It is currently unknown which mTOR complex is most relevant for TSC-related brain phenotypes. Here we used genetic strategies to selectively reduce neuronal mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity in mouse models of TSC. We find that reduction of the mTORC1 component Raptor, but not the mTORC2 component Rictor, rebalanced mTOR signaling in Tsc1 knock-out neurons. Raptor reduction was sufficient to improve several TSC-related phenotypes including neuronal hypertrophy, macrocephaly, impaired myelination, network hyperactivity, and premature mortality. Raptor downregulation represents a promising potential therapeutic intervention for the neurological manifestations of TSC.",Karalis et al show that genetic reduction of the mTORC1 component Raptor improves multiple phenotypes in mouse models of TSC. Their findings suggest that Raptor could be a potential therapeutic target for treating the neurological aspects of TSC.,2022-08-09
851,Microbe capture by splenic macrophages triggers sepsis via T cell-death-dependent neutrophil lifespan shortening,"The mechanisms linking systemic infection to hyperinflammation and immune dysfunction in sepsis are poorly understood. Extracellular histones promote sepsis pathology, but their source and mechanism of action remain unclear. Here, we show that by controlling fungi and bacteria captured by splenic macrophages, neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase attenuates sepsis by suppressing histone release. In systemic candidiasis, microbial capture via the phagocytic receptor SIGNR1 neutralizes myeloperoxidase by facilitating marginal zone infiltration and T cell death-dependent histone release. Histones and hyphae induce cytokines in adjacent CD169 macrophages including G-CSF that selectively depletes mature Ly6Ghigh neutrophils by shortening their lifespan in favour of immature Ly6Glow neutrophils with a defective oxidative burst. In sepsis patient plasma, these mediators shorten mature neutrophil lifespan and correlate with neutrophil mortality markers. Consequently, high G-CSF levels and neutrophil lifespan shortening activity are associated with sepsis patient mortality. Hence, by exploiting phagocytic receptors, pathogens degrade innate and adaptive immunity through the detrimental impact of downstream effectors on neutrophil lifespan.",Hyperinflammation and immune dysfunction are key drivers of immunopathology in sepsis. Here the authors show microbial exploitation of phagocytic receptors is linked to triggering of sepsis and the immune cell mediated reduction in neutrophil life span.,2022-08-09
852,Structural and biochemical basis for DNA and RNA catalysis by human Topoisomerase 3β,"In metazoans, topoisomerase 3β (TOP3B) regulates R-loop dynamics and mRNA translation, which are critical for genome stability, neurodevelopment and normal aging. As a Type IA topoisomerase, TOP3B acts by general acid-base catalysis to break and rejoin single-stranded DNA. Passage of a second DNA strand through the transient break permits dissipation of hypernegative DNA supercoiling and catenation/knotting. Additionally, hsTOP3B was recently demonstrated as the human RNA topoisomerase, required for normal neurodevelopment and proposed to be a potential anti-viral target upon RNA virus infection. Here we elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of human TOP3B. We delineate the roles of divalent metal ions, and of a conserved Lysine residue (K10) in the differential catalysis of DNA and RNA. We also demonstrate that three regulatory factors fine-tune the catalytic performance of TOP3B: the TOP3B C-terminal tail, its protein partner TDRD3, and the sequence of its DNA/RNA substrates.","The authors revealed novel roles of catalytic residues and divalent metal ions for hsTOP3B, the human RNA topoisomerase, and demonstrated the structural elements that kinetically modulate the DNA and RNA topoisomerase activities of TOP3B.",2022-08-09
853,Shielded soft force sensors,"Force and strain sensors made of soft materials enable robots to interact intelligently with their surroundings. Capacitive sensing is widely adopted thanks to its low power consumption, fast response, and facile fabrication. Capacitive sensors are, however, susceptible to electromagnetic interference and proximity effects and thus require electrical shielding. Shielding has not been previously implemented in soft capacitive sensors due to the parasitic capacitance between the shield and sensing electrodes, which changes when the sensor is deformed. We address this crucial challenge by patterning the central sensing elastomer layer to control its compressibility. One design uses an ultrasoft silicone foam, and the other includes microchannels filled with liquid metal and air. The force resolution is sub-mN both in normal and shear directions, yet the sensor withstands large forces (>20 N), demonstrating a wide dynamic range. Performance is unaffected by nearby high DC and AC electric fields and even electric sparks.","Capacitive soft force sensors require electrical shielding from electromagnetic interference, but this shielding can mess with the effectiveness of the sensing electrodes. Here, Aksoy et al. solve this problem by patterning the central sensing elastomer layer to control its compressibility.",2022-08-09
854,Erasure conversion for fault-tolerant quantum computing in alkaline earth Rydberg atom arrays,"Executing quantum algorithms on error-corrected logical qubits is a critical step for scalable quantum computing, but the requisite numbers of qubits and physical error rates are demanding for current experimental hardware. Recently, the development of error correcting codes tailored to particular physical noise models has helped relax these requirements. In this work, we propose a qubit encoding and gate protocol for 171Yb neutral atom qubits that converts the dominant physical errors into erasures, that is, errors in known locations. The key idea is to encode qubits in a metastable electronic level, such that gate errors predominantly result in transitions to disjoint subspaces whose populations can be continuously monitored via fluorescence. We estimate that 98% of errors can be converted into erasures. We quantify the benefit of this approach via circuit-level simulations of the surface code, finding a threshold increase from 0.937% to 4.15%. We also observe a larger code distance near the threshold, leading to a faster decrease in the logical error rate for the same number of physical qubits, which is important for near-term implementations. Erasure conversion should benefit any error correcting code, and may also be applied to design new gates and encodings in other qubit platforms.","In quantum computing, realistic error models can allow tailored correction schemes for specific platforms. Here, while considering the case of qubits encoded in metastable electronic levels of atomic arrays, the authors propose a way to convert a large fraction of occurring errors into detectable leakages, or erasure errors, which are vastly easier to correct.",2022-08-09
855,A strategy to assess spillover risk of bat SARS-related coronaviruses in Southeast Asia,"Emerging diseases caused by coronaviruses of likely bat origin (e.g., SARS, MERS, SADS, COVID-19) have disrupted global health and economies for two decades. Evidence suggests that some bat SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) could infect people directly, and that their spillover is more frequent than previously recognized. Each zoonotic spillover of a novel virus represents an opportunity for evolutionary adaptation and further spread; therefore, quantifying the extent of this spillover may help target prevention programs. We derive current range distributions for known bat SARSr-CoV hosts and quantify their overlap with human populations. We then use probabilistic risk assessment and data on human-bat contact, human viral seroprevalence, and antibody duration to estimate that a median of 66,280 people (95% CI: 65,351–67,131) are infected with SARSr-CoVs annually in Southeast Asia. These data on the geography and scale of spillover can be used to target surveillance and prevention programs for potential future bat-CoV emergence.","Coronaviruses may spill over from bats to humans. This study uses epidemiological data, species distribution models, and probabilistic risk assessment to map overlap among people and SARSr-CoV bat hosts and estimate how many people are infected with bat-origin SARSr-CoVs in Southeast Asia annually.",2022-08-09
856,Endogenically sourced volatiles on Charon and other Kuiper belt objects,"Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) have diverse surface compositions, and the New Horizons mission to the Pluto-Charon system allows us to test hypotheses on the origin and evolution of these KBO surfaces. Previous work proposed that Charon’s organic-rich north pole formed from radiolytically processed volatiles sourced from Pluto’s escaping atmosphere. Here, we show an endogenic source of volatiles from Charon’s interior is plausible. We calculate that cryovolcanic resurfacing released 1.29 × 1015–3.47 × 1015 kg of methane to Charon’s surface from its interior. We modeled volatile transport and found the vast majority of this volcanically released methane migrates to Charon’s poles, with deposition rates sufficient to be processed into the observed organic compounds. Irradiated methane products appear on similarly sized KBOs that do not orbit a Pluto-sized object to draw an escaping atmosphere from, so interior-sourced volatiles could be a common and important process across the Kuiper belt.","We show cryovolcanic eruptions released sufficient methane to source volatile products on Charon. Irradiated methane products are found on other Kuiper belt objects, so endogenically sourced volatiles could be important across the Kuiper belt.",2022-08-09
857,An open-label pilot study of recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in Friedreich’s ataxia,"Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disease for which there is no proven disease-modifying treatment. Here we perform an open‐label, pilot study of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration in seven people with FA (EudraCT: 2017-003084-34); each participant receiving a single course of G-CSF (Lenograstim; 1.28 million units per kg per day for 5 days). The primary outcome is peripheral blood mononuclear cell frataxin levels over a 19-day period. The secondary outcomes include safety, haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilisation, antioxidant levels and mitochondrial enzyme activity. The trial meets pre-specified endpoints. We show that administration of G-CSF to people with FA is safe. Mobilisation of HSCs in response to G-CSF is comparable to that of healthy individuals. Notably, sustained increases in cellular frataxin concentrations and raised PGC-1α and Nrf2 expression are detected. Our findings show potential for G-CSF therapy to have a clinical impact in people with FA.",Work in a mouse model of Friedreich’s ataxia has shown that administration of the cytokine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) could have beneficial neuroprotective effects.

858,Connecting omics signatures and revealing biological mechanisms with iLINCS,"There are only a few platforms that integrate multiple omics data types, bioinformatics tools, and interfaces for integrative analyses and visualization that do not require programming skills. Here we present iLINCS (http://ilincs.org), an integrative web-based platform for analysis of omics data and signatures of cellular perturbations. The platform facilitates mining and re-analysis of the large collection of omics datasets (>34,000), pre-computed signatures (>200,000), and their connections, as well as the analysis of user-submitted omics signatures of diseases and cellular perturbations. iLINCS analysis workflows integrate vast omics data resources and a range of analytics and interactive visualization tools into a comprehensive platform for analysis of omics signatures. iLINCS user-friendly interfaces enable execution of sophisticated analyses of omics signatures, mechanism of action analysis, and signature-driven drug repositioning. We illustrate the utility of iLINCS with three use cases involving analysis of cancer proteogenomic signatures, COVID 19 transcriptomic signatures and mTOR signaling.","There are only a few platforms that integrate multiple omics data types, bioinformatics tools, and interfaces for integrative analyses and visualization that do not require programming skills.

859,Protection of Omicron sub-lineage infection against reinfection with another Omicron sub-lineage,"There is significant genetic distance between SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant BA.1 and BA.2 sub-lineages. This study investigates immune protection of infection with one sub-lineage against reinfection with the other sub-lineage in Qatar during a large BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron wave, from December 19, 2021 to March 21, 2022. Two national matched, retrospective cohort studies are conducted to estimate effectiveness of BA.1 infection against reinfection with BA.2 (N = 20,994; BA.1-against-BA.2 study), and effectiveness of BA.2 infection against reinfection with BA.1 (N = 110,315; BA.2-against-BA.1 study). Associations are estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models after multiple imputation to assign a sub-lineage status for cases with no sub-lineage status (using probabilities based on the test date). Effectiveness of BA.1 infection against reinfection with BA.2 is estimated at 94.2% (95% CI: 89.2–96.9%). Effectiveness of BA.2 infection against reinfection with BA.1 is estimated at 80.9% (95% CI: 73.1–86.4%). Infection with the BA.1 sub-lineage appears to induce strong, but not full immune protection against reinfection with the BA.2 sub-lineage, and vice versa, for at least several weeks after the initial infection.","The level of immunity induced by infection with different SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sub-lineages against infection with other sub-lineages is not known. Here, the authors use data from Qatar and show that infection with BA.1 induces strong protection against infection with BA.2, and vice versa, for several weeks.",2022-08-09
860,Repeated genetic adaptation to altitude in two tropical butterflies,"Repeated evolution can provide insight into the mechanisms that facilitate adaptation to novel or changing environments. Here we study adaptation to altitude in two tropical butterflies, Heliconius erato and H. melpomene, which have repeatedly and independently adapted to montane habitats on either side of the Andes. We sequenced 518 whole genomes from altitudinal transects and found many regions differentiated between highland (~ 1200 m) and lowland (~ 200 m) populations. We show repeated genetic differentiation across replicate populations within species, including allopatric comparisons. In contrast, there is little molecular parallelism between the two species. By sampling five close relatives, we find that a large proportion of divergent regions identified within species have arisen from standing variation and putative adaptive introgression from high-altitude specialist species. Taken together our study supports a role for both standing genetic variation and gene flow from independently adapted species in promoting parallel local adaptation to the environment.","Here, the authors study adaptation to altitude in 518 whole genomes from two species of tropical butterflies. They find repeated genetic differentiation within species, little molecular parallelism between these species, and introgression from closely related species, concluding that standing genetic variation promotes parallel local adaptation.",2022-08-09
861,MYC sensitises cells to apoptosis by driving energetic demand,"The MYC oncogene is a potent driver of growth and proliferation but also sensitises cells to apoptosis, which limits its oncogenic potential. MYC induces several biosynthetic programmes and primary cells overexpressing MYC are highly sensitive to glutamine withdrawal suggesting that MYC-induced sensitisation to apoptosis may be due to imbalance of metabolic/energetic supply and demand. Here we show that MYC elevates global transcription and translation, even in the absence of glutamine, revealing metabolic demand without corresponding supply. Glutamine withdrawal from MRC-5 fibroblasts depletes key tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites and, in combination with MYC activation, leads to AMP accumulation and nucleotide catabolism indicative of energetic stress. Further analyses reveal that glutamine supports viability through TCA cycle energetics rather than asparagine biosynthesis and that TCA cycle inhibition confers tumour suppression on MYC-driven lymphoma in vivo. In summary, glutamine supports the viability of MYC-overexpressing cells through an energetic rather than a biosynthetic mechanism.","MYC activation can sensitise cells to apoptosis upon glutamine withdrawal. Here the authors show that MYC activation enhances global transcription and translation that creates a metabolic demand, while glutamine limitation causes a metabolic demand and supply imbalance through loss of TCA energetics and thus, sensitises cells to apoptosis.",2022-08-09
862,Ultra-flat and long-lived plasmons in a strongly correlated oxide,"Plasmons in strongly correlated systems are attracting considerable attention due to their unconventional behavior caused by electronic correlation effects. Recently, flat plasmons with nearly dispersionless frequency-wave vector relations have drawn significant interest because of their intriguing physical origin and promising applications. However, these flat plasmons exist primarily in low-dimensional materials with limited wave vector magnitudes (q < ~0.7 Å−1). Here, we show that long-lived flat plasmons can propagate up to ~1.2 Å−1 in α-Ti2O3, a strongly correlated three-dimensional Mott-insulator, with an ultra-small energy fluctuation (<40 meV). The strong correlation effect renormalizes the electronic bands near Fermi level with a small bandwidth, which is responsible for the flat plasmons in α-Ti2O3. Moreover, these flat plasmons are not affected by Landau damping over a wide range of wave vectors (q < ~1.2 Å−1) due to symmetry constrains on the electron wavefunctions. Our work provides a strategy for exploring flat plasmons in strongly correlated systems, which in turn may give rise to novel plasmonic devices in which flat and long-lived plasmons are desirable.","Dispersionless plasmons could find important practical applications, but previous demonstrations have been limited to 2D materials and small momentum range. Here the authors report ultra-flat plasmons propagating over a wide range of momenta in a 3D strongly correlated oxide α-Ti2O3.",2022-08-09
863,Designing against phase and property heterogeneities in additively manufactured titanium alloys,"Additive manufacturing (AM) creates digitally designed parts by successive addition of material. However, owing to intrinsic thermal cycling, metallic parts produced by AM almost inevitably suffer from spatially dependent heterogeneities in phases and mechanical properties, which may cause unpredictable service failures. Here, we demonstrate a synergistic alloy design approach to overcome this issue in titanium alloys manufactured by laser powder bed fusion. The key to our approach is in-situ alloying of Ti−6Al−4V (in weight per cent) with combined additions of pure titanium powders and iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticles. This not only enables in-situ elimination of phase heterogeneity through diluting V concentration whilst introducing small amounts of Fe, but also compensates for the strength loss via oxygen solute strengthening. Our alloys achieve spatially uniform microstructures and mechanical properties which are superior to those of Ti−6Al−4V. This study may help to guide the design of other alloys, which not only overcomes the challenge inherent to the AM processes, but also takes advantage of the alloy design opportunities offered by AM.",Additively manufactured Ti alloys exhibit spatially dependent microstructures and mechanical properties owing to the intrinsic thermal cycling. Here the authors develop new Ti alloys with uniform mechanical properties through a rational alloy design.,2022-08-09
864,Dicer ablation in Kiss1 neurons impairs puberty and fertility preferentially in female mice,"Kiss1 neurons, producing kisspeptins, are essential for puberty and fertility, but their molecular regulatory mechanisms remain unfolded. Here, we report that congenital ablation of the microRNA-synthesizing enzyme, Dicer, in Kiss1 cells, causes late-onset hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in both sexes, but is compatible with pubertal initiation and preserved Kiss1 neuronal populations at the infantile/juvenile period. Yet, failure to complete puberty and attain fertility is observed only in females. Kiss1-specific ablation of Dicer evokes disparate changes of Kiss1-cell numbers and Kiss1/kisspeptin expression between hypothalamic subpopulations during the pubertal-transition, with a predominant decline in arcuate-nucleus Kiss1 levels, linked to enhanced expression of its repressors, Mkrn3, Cbx7 and Eap1. Our data unveil that miRNA-biosynthesis in Kiss1 neurons is essential for pubertal completion and fertility, especially in females, but dispensable for initial reproductive maturation and neuronal survival in both sexes. Our results disclose a predominant miRNA-mediated inhibitory program of repressive signals that is key for precise regulation of Kiss1 expression and, thereby, reproductive function.","Kiss1 neurons are essential for puberty and fertility. Here, the authors show that canonical microRNA biosynthesis in Kiss1 neurons plays an essential role in the control of puberty and fertility, especially in females, likely via repression of repressors on the Kiss1 gene.",2022-08-09
865,Pro-oxidant response and accelerated ferroptosis caused by synergetic Au(I) release in hypercarbon-centered gold(I) cluster prodrugs,"Medicinal applications of gold complexes have recently attracted attention due to their innovative antitumor mechanisms. In this work, two hypercoordinated carbon-centered gold clusters PAA4 and PAA5 are quantitatively synthesized by an intramolecular 6-exo-dig cyclization of polymetalated precursors. The on-bench and in vitro experimental studies demonstrate that the characteristic hypercarbon-tetragold(I) multi-center bonding in PAA4 and PAA5 not only guarantees their stability under common physiological conditions, but also facilitates a glutathione (GSH)-triggered prompt and synergetic release of active Au(I) ions in the GSH-overexpressed and acidic microenvironment of human bladder cancer EJ cells. The instantly massive release of coordination unsaturated Au(I) ions causes the efficient inhibition of thioredoxin reductases and then induces a rapid pro-oxidant response, consequently causing the occurrence of accelerated ferroptosis of EJ cells. As a result, these hypercarbon-centered gold(I) cluster prodrugs show high cytotoxicity to bladder cancer cell lines and thus exhibit a significant inhibition effect towards bladder tumors in vivo. Correlation of the synergetic domino dissociation of carbon-polymetal multi-center bonding in metal clusters with the accelerated ferroptosis of cancer cells provides a strategy for metallo-prodrugs and opens a broader prospect for the biological application of metal cluster compounds.","Several strategies have been developed in recent years for therapeutic induction of ferroptosis in cancer. Here the authors report the design of two hypercarbon-centered gold(I) cluster prodrugs that induce ferroptosis of cancer cells, showing anti-tumor activity in preclinical bladder cancer models.",2022-08-09
866,Development of a pentavalent broadly protective nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine against influenza B viruses,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines represent a new, effective vaccine platform with high capacity for rapid development. Generation of a universal influenza virus vaccine with the potential to elicit long-lasting, broadly cross-reactive immune responses is a necessity for reducing influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. Here we focus on the development of a universal influenza B virus vaccine based on the lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) platform. We evaluate vaccine candidates based on different target antigens that afford protection against challenge with ancestral and recent influenza B viruses from both antigenic lineages. A pentavalent vaccine combining all tested antigens protects mice from morbidity at a very low dose of 50 ng per antigen after a single vaccination. These findings support the further advancement of nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNPs expressing multiple conserved antigens as universal influenza virus vaccine candidates.","The public health concern caused by influenza B virus is often overlooked, yet represents a significant global burden. Here, the authors evaluate the cellular and humoral immune responses of multivalent vaccine candidates, based on the lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA platform, and demonstrate protection of mice from challenge with a broad panel of influenza B viruses.",2022-08-09
867,Ultrafast small-scale soft electromagnetic robots,"High-speed locomotion is an essential survival strategy for animals, allowing populating harsh and unpredictable environments. Bio-inspired soft robots equally benefit from versatile and ultrafast motion but require appropriate driving mechanisms and device designs. Here, we present a class of small-scale soft electromagnetic robots made of curved elastomeric bilayers, driven by Lorentz forces acting on embedded printed liquid metal channels carrying alternating currents with driving voltages of several volts in a static magnetic field. Their dynamic resonant performance is investigated experimentally and theoretically. These robust and versatile robots can walk, run, swim, jump, steer and transport cargo. Their tethered versions reach ultra-high running speeds of 70 BL/s (body lengths per second) on 3D-corrugated substrates and 35 BL/s on arbitrary planar substrates while their maximum swimming speed is 4.8 BL/s in water. Moreover, prototype untethered versions run and swim at a maximum speed of 2.1 BL/s and 1.8 BL/s, respectively.","Inspired by fast running cheetahs, the authors present a class of small-scale soft electromagnetic robots able to reach ultra-high running speeds of 70 BL/s (body lengths per second) as well as the ability to swim, jump, steer and transport cargo.",2022-08-09
868,A suite of PCR-LwCas13a assays for detection and genotyping of Treponema pallidum in clinical samples,"The performance of commonly used assays for diagnosis of syphilis varies considerably depending on stage of infection and sample type. In response to the need for improved syphilis diagnostics, we develop assays that pair PCR pre-amplification of the tpp47 gene of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum with CRISPR-LwCas13a. The PCR-LwCas13a assay achieves an order of magnitude better analytical sensitivity than real-time PCR with equivalent specificity. When applied to a panel of 216 biological specimens, including 135 clinically confirmed primary and secondary syphilis samples, the PCR-LwCas13a assay demonstrates 93.3% clinical sensitivity and 100% specificity, outperforming tpp47 real-time PCR and rabbit-infectivity testing. We further adapt this approach to distinguish Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum lineages and identify genetic markers of macrolide resistance. Our study demonstrates the potential of CRISPR-based approaches to improve diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of syphilis.","Clinical diagnosis of Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (TPA), the causative agent of syphilis, depends upon serological testing, which has reduced sensitivity for some stages of the disease. Accompanying methods to complement serological testing also have distinct limitations.

869,The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factor DPF3 regulates metastasis of ccRCC by modulating TGF-β signaling,"DPF3, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, has been associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in a genome-wide association study. However, the functional role of DPF3 in ccRCC development and progression remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that DPF3a, the short isoform of DPF3, promotes kidney cancer cell migration both in vitro and in vivo, consistent with the clinical observation that DPF3a is significantly upregulated in ccRCC patients with metastases. Mechanistically, DPF3a specifically interacts with SNIP1, via which it forms a complex with SMAD4 and p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT), the major transcriptional regulators of TGF-β signaling pathway. Moreover, the binding of DPF3a releases the repressive effect of SNIP1 on p300 HAT activity, leading to the increase in local histone acetylation and the activation of cell movement related genes. Overall, our findings reveal a metastasis-promoting function of DPF3, and further establish the link between SWI/SNF components and ccRCC.","The functional role of DPF3, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), remains unknown. Here, the authors characterise the mechanism by which DPF3 promotes metastasis via the activation of the TGF-β signalling pathway in ccRCC.",2022-08-09
870,Transferability of genetic loci and polygenic scores for cardiometabolic traits in British Pakistani and Bangladeshi individuals,"Individuals with South Asian ancestry have a higher risk of heart disease than other groups but have been largely excluded from genetic research. Using data from 22,000 British Pakistani and Bangladeshi individuals with linked electronic health records from the Genes & Health cohort, we conducted genome-wide association studies of coronary artery disease and its key risk factors. Using power-adjusted transferability ratios, we found evidence for transferability for the majority of cardiometabolic loci powered to replicate. The performance of polygenic scores was high for lipids and blood pressure, but lower for BMI and coronary artery disease. Adding a polygenic score for coronary artery disease to clinical risk factors showed significant improvement in reclassification. In Mendelian randomisation using transferable loci as instruments, our findings were consistent with results in European-ancestry individuals. Taken together, trait-specific transferability of trait loci between populations is an important consideration with implications for risk prediction and causal inference.","Most genetic studies of disease have been done in European ancestry cohorts, and the relevance to other populations is not guaranteed. Here, the authors use data from 22,000 British South Asian individuals and find that the transferability of polygenic scores was high for lipids and blood pressure, and lower for BMI and coronary artery disease.",2022-08-09
871,Integrated methylome and phenome study of the circulating proteome reveals markers pertinent to brain health,"Characterising associations between the methylome, proteome and phenome may provide insight into biological pathways governing brain health. Here, we report an integrated DNA methylation and phenotypic study of the circulating proteome in relation to brain health. Methylome-wide association studies of 4058 plasma proteins are performed (N = 774), identifying 2928 CpG-protein associations after adjustment for multiple testing. These are independent of known genetic protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and common lifestyle effects. Phenome-wide association studies of each protein are then performed in relation to 15 neurological traits (N = 1,065), identifying 405 associations between the levels of 191 proteins and cognitive scores, brain imaging measures or APOE e4 status. We uncover 35 previously unreported DNA methylation signatures for 17 protein markers of brain health. The epigenetic and proteomic markers we identify are pertinent to understanding and stratifying brain health.","Characterising associations between the methylome, proteome and phenome may provide insight into biological pathways governing brain health. Here, blood protein markers of brain health are integrated with omics data to reveal DNA methylation differences that associate with these protein markers.",2022-08-09
872,Crustal melting in orogenic belts revealed by eclogite thermal properties,"Partial melting in the continental crust may play a critical role on the behavior of continents during collision. However, the occurrence of partial melt in orogenic continental crust is not well understood. Since the temperature of the orogen is controlled by the thermal properties of constituent rocks, we measured the thermal conductivity and diffusivity of eclogite, the most important ultrahigh pressure metamorphic rocks, as a function of pressure, temperature, composition, and water content, and simulated the thermal structure of the Sulu and Himalaya-Tibet orogens in eastern and southwestern China, respectively. Our results show that the temperature at ~30-km depth beneath the orogens reaches the solidus of wet granite and phengite (~940 K), therefore, the partial melting in the orogenic continental crust is well explained. The melt may facilitate the exhumation of subducted crust, produce the low seismic-velocity zone, and cause the high-conductivity anomaly in the shallow depth of orogenic belts.","By measuring the thermal properties of eclogite at high pressures, the authors found that temperature of orogenic continental crust is sufficient to melt granite and phengite, leading to low-velocity and high-conductivity anomalies in orogenic belts.",2022-08-09
873,Met1-specific motifs conserved in OTUB subfamily of green plants enable rice OTUB1 to hydrolyse Met1 ubiquitin chains,"Linear (Met1-linked) ubiquitination is involved inflammatory and innate immune signaling. Previous studies have characterized enzymes regulating the addition and removal of this modification in mammalian systems. However, only a few plant-derived deubiquitinases targeting Met1-linked ubiquitin chains have been reported and their mechanism of action remains elusive. Here, using a dehydroalanine-bearing Met1-diubiquitin suicide probe, we discover OTUB1 from Oryza sativa (OsOTUB1) as a Met1-linked ubiquitin chain-targeting deubiquitinase. By solving crystal structures of apo OsOTUB1 and an OsOTUB1/Met1-diubiquitin complex, we find that Met1 activity is conferred by Met1-specific motifs in the S1’ pocket of OsOTUB1. Large-scale sequence alignments and hydrolysis experiments provide evidence that these motifs are a general determinant of Met1 activity in the OTUB subfamily across species. Analysis of the species distribution of OTUBs capable of hydrolysing Met1-linked ubiquitin chains shows that this activity is conserved in green plants (Viridiplantae) and does not exist in metazoans, providing insights into the evolutionary differentiation between primitive plants and animals.","Deubiquitinases (DUBs) targeting Met1-linked ubiquitin chains have important functions in mammals but are barely studied in plants. Here, the authors identify rice OTUB1 as a Met1-targeting DUB, characterize the structural determinants of this activity, and show that these features are conserved in green plants.",2022-08-09
874,A CRISPR-based ultrasensitive assay detects attomolar concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in clinical samples,"CRISPR diagnostics are powerful tools for detecting nucleic acids but are generally not deployable for the detection of clinically important proteins. Here, we report an ultrasensitive CRISPR-based antibody detection (UCAD) assay that translates the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies into CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection in a homogeneous solution and is 10,000 times more sensitive than the classic immunoassays. Clinical validation using serum samples collected from the general population (n = 197), demonstrates that UCAD has 100% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity. With ultrahigh sensitivity, UCAD enables the quantitative analysis of serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 levels in vaccinated kidney transplant recipients who are shown to produce “undetectable” anti-SARS-CoV-2 using standard immunoassay. Because of the high sensitivity and simplicity, we anticipate that, upon further clinical validation against large cohorts of clinical samples, UCAD will find wide applications for clinical uses in both centralized laboratories and point-of-care settings.","CRISPR diagnostics are routinely used for the detecting nucleic acids, but rarely for clinically important proteins. Here, by translating a CRISPR-based DNA test into an ultrasensitive assay for antibodies, the authors achieve antibody detection from serum samples at attomolar concentrations.",2022-08-09
875,Electronic gap characterization at mesoscopic scale via scanning probe microscopy under ambient conditions,"Electronic gaps play an important role in the electric and optical properties of materials. Although various experimental techniques, such as scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and optical or photoemission spectroscopy, are normally used to perform electronic band structure characterizations, it is still challenging to measure the electronic gap at the nanoscale under ambient conditions. Here we report a scanning probe microscopic technique to characterize the electronic gap with nanometre resolution at room temperature and ambient pressure. The technique probes the electronic gap by monitoring the changes of the local quantum capacitance via the Coulomb force at a mesoscopic scale. We showcase this technique by characterizing several 2D semiconductors and van der Waals heterostructures under ambient conditions.","The nanoscale measurement of electronic bandgaps is crucial for material characterization, but it is usually performed under cryogenic conditions. Here, the authors report a scanning probe method to determine the electronic bandgap of 2D semiconductors at the nanoscale by monitoring their quantum capacitance under ambient conditions.",2022-08-08
876,Thy1 marks a distinct population of slow-cycling stem cells in the mouse epidermis,"The presence of distinct stem cells that maintain the interfollicular epidermis is highly debated. Here, we report a population of keratinocytes, marked by Thy1, in the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis. We find that epidermal cells expressing differential levels of Thy1 display distinct transcriptional signatures. Thy1+ keratinocytes do not express T cell markers, express a unique transcriptional profile, cycle significantly slower than basal epidermal progenitors and display significant expansion potential in vitro. Multicolor lineage tracing analyses and mathematical modeling reveal that Thy1+ basal keratinocytes do not compete neutrally alike interfollicular progenitors and contribute long-term to both epidermal replenishment and wound repair. Importantly, ablation of Thy1+ cells strongly impairs these processes, thus indicating the non-redundant function of Thy1+ stem cells in the epidermis. Collectively, these results reveal a distinct stem cell population that plays a critical role in epidermal homeostasis and repair.",Koren and Feldman et al. report a distinct population of Thy1-expressing stem cells in the basal layer of the mouse epidermis. These stem cells do not compete neutrally and contribute long-term to both epidermal replenishment and wound repair.,2022-08-08
877,Cytosine base editing systems with minimized off-target effect and molecular size,"Cytosine base editing enables the installation of specific point mutations without double-strand breaks in DNA and is advantageous for various applications such as gene therapy, but further reduction of off-target risk and development of efficient delivery methods are desired. Here we show structure-based rational engineering of the cytosine base editing system Target-AID to minimize its off-target effect and molecular size. By intensive and careful truncation, DNA-binding domain of its deaminase PmCDA1 is eliminated and additional mutations are introduced to restore enzyme function. The resulting tCDA1EQ is effective in N-terminal fusion (AID-2S) or inlaid architecture (AID-3S) with Cas9, showing minimized RNA-mediated editing and gRNA-dependent/independent DNA off-targets, as assessed in human cells. Combining with the smaller Cas9 ortholog system (SaCas9), a cytosine base editing system is created that is within the size limit of AAV vector.","Base editing is promising for gene therapy, but in vivo delivery has been limiting. Here the authors perform structure-based rational engineering of the cytosine base editing system Target-AID to minimise off-target effects and decrease its size.",2022-08-08
878,Competition between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells controls hematopoietic stem cell compartment size,"Cellular competition for limiting hematopoietic factors is a physiologically regulated but poorly understood process. Here, we studied this phenomenon by hampering hematopoietic progenitor access to Leptin receptor+ mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). We show that HSC numbers increase by 2-fold when multipotent and lineage-restricted progenitors fail to respond to CXCL12 produced by MSPCs and ECs. HSCs are qualitatively normal, and HSC expansion only occurs when early hematopoietic progenitors but not differentiated hematopoietic cells lack CXCR4. Furthermore, the MSPC and EC transcriptomic heterogeneity is stable, suggesting that it is impervious to major changes in hematopoietic progenitor interactions. Instead, HSC expansion correlates with increased availability of membrane-bound stem cell factor (mSCF) on MSPCs and ECs presumably due to reduced consumption by cKit-expressing hematopoietic progenitors. These studies suggest that an intricate homeostatic balance between HSCs and proximal hematopoietic progenitors is regulated by cell competition for limited amounts of mSCF.","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) rely on a combination of paracrine signals produced by their niche, including SCF. Here the authors show that HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors compete for limited amounts of membrane-bound SCF.",2022-08-08
879,Tectonically-driven oxidant production in the hot biosphere,"Genomic reconstructions of the common ancestor to all life have identified genes involved in H2O2 and O2 cycling. Commonly dismissed as an artefact of lateral gene transfer after oxygenic photosynthesis evolved, an alternative is a geological source of H2O2 and O2 on the early Earth. Here, we show that under oxygen-free conditions high concentrations of H2O2 can be released from defects on crushed silicate rocks when water is added and heated to temperatures close to boiling point, but little is released at temperatures <80 °C. This temperature window overlaps the growth ranges of evolutionary ancient heat-loving and oxygen-respiring Bacteria and Archaea near the root of the Universal Tree of Life. We propose that the thermal activation of mineral surface defects during geological fault movements and associated stresses in the Earth’s crust was a source of oxidants that helped drive the (bio)geochemistry of hot fractures where life first evolved.",Researchers at Newcastle University have discovered a mechanism by which earthquakes create bursts of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen in hot underground fractures. These may have played a vital role in the early evolution and origin of life on Earth.,2022-08-08
880,A 33-residue peptide tag increases solubility and stability of Escherichia coli produced single-chain antibody fragments,"Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), composed of variable domains of heavy and light chains of an antibody joined by a linker, share antigen binding capacity with their parental antibody. Due to intrinsically low solubility and stability, only two Escherichia coli-produced scFvs have been approved for therapy. Here we report that a 33-residue peptide, termed P17 tag, increases the solubility of multiple scFvs produced in Escherichia coli SHuffle strain by up to 11.6 fold. Hydrophilic sequence, especially charged residues, but not the predicted α-helical secondary structure of P17 tag, contribute to the solubility enhancement. Notably, the P17 tag elevates the thermostability of scFv as efficiently as intra-domain disulfide bonds. Moreover, a P17-tagged scFv targeting hepatitis B virus surface proteins shows over two-fold higher antigen-binding affinity and virus-neutralizing activity than the untagged version. These data strongly suggest a type I intramolecular chaperone-like activity of the P17 tag. Hence, the P17 tag could benefit the research, production, and application of scFv.",Low solubility and stability of Escherichia coli produced single chain variable fragments (scFvs) restrict their applications. Here the authors report a 33-residue peptide tag which simultaneously increases the solubility and thermostability of multiple scFvs produced in Escherichia coli SHuffle strain.,2022-08-08
881,Quantum-assisted distortion-free audio signal sensing,"Quantum sensors are known for their high sensitivity in sensing applications. However, this sensitivity often comes with severe restrictions on other parameters which are also important. Examples are that in measurements of arbitrary signals, limitation in linear dynamic range could introduce distortions in magnitude and phase of the signal. High frequency resolution is another important feature for reconstructing unknown signals. Here, we demonstrate a distortion-free quantum sensing protocol that combines a quantum phase-sensitive detection with heterodyne readout. We present theoretical and experimental investigations using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, showing the capability of reconstructing audio frequency signals with an extended linear dynamic range and high frequency resolution. Melody and speech based signals are used for demonstrating the features. The methods could broaden the horizon for quantum sensors towards applications, e.g. telecommunication in challenging environment, where low-distortion measurements are required at multiple frequency bands within a limited volume.","High sensitivity in quantum sensing comes often at the expense of other figures of merit, usually resulting in distortion. Here, the authors propose a protocol with good sensitivity, readout linearity and high frequency resolution, and benchmark it through signal measurements at audio bands with NV centers.",2022-08-08
882,Inequality of household water security follows a Development Kuznets Curve,"Water security requires not only sufficient availability of and access to safe and acceptable quality for domestic uses, but also fair distribution within and across populations. However, a key research gap remains in understanding water security inequality and its dynamics, which in turn creates an impediment to tracking progress towards sustainable development. Therefore, we analyse the inequality of water security using data from 7603 households across 28 sites in 22 low- and middle-income countries, measured using the Household Water Insecurity Experiences Scale. Here we show an inverted-U shaped relationship between site water security and inequality of household water security. This Kuznets-like curve suggests a process that as water security grows, the inequality of water security first increases then decreases. This research extends the Kuznets curve applications and introduces the Development Kuznets Curve concept. Its practical implications support building water security and achieving more fair, inclusive, and sustainable development.",A new study considering data from 7603 households across 28 sites in 22 low- and middle-income countries show that inequality of household water security follows a Development Kuznets Curve.,2022-08-08
883,Topological superfluid defects with discrete point group symmetries,"Discrete symmetries are spatially ubiquitous but are often hidden in internal states of systems where they can have especially profound consequences. In this work we create and verify exotic magnetic phases of atomic spinor Bose–Einstein condensates that, despite their continuous character and intrinsic spatial isotropy, exhibit complex discrete polytope symmetries in their topological defects. Using carefully tailored spinor rotations and microwave transitions, we engineer singular line defects whose quantization conditions, exchange statistics, and dynamics are fundamentally determined by these underlying symmetries. We show how filling the vortex line singularities with atoms in a variety of different phases leads to core structures that possess magnetic interfaces with rich combinations of discrete and continuous symmetries. Such defects, with their non-commutative properties, could provide unconventional realizations of quantum information and interferometry.","Ordinary vortex line defects are well-studied across different physical systems. Here the authors demonstrate, in atomic spinor Bose–Einstein condensates, previously unobserved vortex line defects with discrete polytope symmetries, which are of interest to quantum information applications.",2022-08-08
884,Strikingly distinctive NH3-SCR behavior over Cu-SSZ-13 in the presence of NO2,"Commercial Cu-exchanged small-pore SSZ-13 (Cu-SSZ-13) zeolite catalysts are highly active for the standard selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH3. However, their activity is unexpectedly inhibited in the presence of NO2 at low temperatures. This is strikingly distinct from the NO2-accelerated NOx conversion over other typical SCR catalyst systems. Here, we combine kinetic experiments, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain direct evidence that under reaction conditions, strong oxidation by NO2 forces Cu ions to exist mainly as CuII species (fw-Cu2+ and NH3-solvated CuII with high CNs), which impedes the mobility of Cu species. The SCR reaction occurring at these CuII sites with weak mobility shows a higher energy barrier than that of the standard SCR reaction on dynamic binuclear sites. Moreover, the NO2-involved SCR reaction tends to occur at the Brønsted acid sites (BASs) rather than the CuII sites. This work clearly explains the strikingly distinctive selective catalytic behavior in this zeolite system.","Cu-SSZ-13 zeolites are highly active for standard NH3-SCR, but their activity is unexpectedly inhibited in the presence of NO2. This work demonstrates that strong oxidation by NO2 forces Cu ions to exist mainly as CuII species with low mobility, which is responsible for this distinctive behavior.",2022-08-08
885,Allosteric modulation of GPCR-induced β-arrestin trafficking and signaling by a synthetic intrabody,"Agonist-induced phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a primary determinant of β-arrestin (βarr) recruitment and trafficking. For several GPCRs such as the vasopressin receptor subtype 2 (V2R), agonist-stimulation first drives the translocation of βarrs to the plasma membrane, followed by endosomal trafficking, which is generally considered to be orchestrated by multiple phosphorylation sites. We have previously shown that mutation of a single phosphorylation site in the V2R (i.e., V2RT360A) results in near-complete loss of βarr translocation to endosomes despite robust recruitment to the plasma membrane, and compromised ERK1/2 activation. Here, we discover that a synthetic intrabody (Ib30), which selectively recognizes activated βarr1, efficiently rescues the endosomal trafficking of βarr1 and ERK1/2 activation for V2RT360A. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that Ib30 enriches active-like βarr1 conformation with respect to the inter-domain rotation, and cellular assays demonstrate that it also enhances βarr1-β2-adaptin interaction. Our data provide an experimental framework to positively modulate the receptor-transducer-effector axis for GPCRs using intrabodies, which can be potentially integrated in the paradigm of GPCR-targeted drug discovery.","G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins and the largest class of drug targets in the human genome. Here, Baidya et al. show that a synthetic antibody can be used to modulate GPCR trafficking and signaling in live cells.",2022-08-08
886,Acetate reprograms gut microbiota during alcohol consumption,"Liver damage due to chronic alcohol use is among the most prevalent liver diseases. Alcohol consumption frequency is a strong factor of microbiota variance. Here we use isotope labeled [1-13C] ethanol, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics in ethanol-feeding and intragastric mouse models to investigate the metabolic impacts of alcohol consumption on the gut microbiota. First, we show that although stable isotope labeled [1-13C] ethanol contributes to fatty acid pools in the liver, plasma, and cecum contents of mice, there is no evidence of ethanol metabolism by gut microbiota ex vivo under anaerobic conditions. Next, we observe through metatranscriptomics that the gut microbiota responds to ethanol-feeding by activating acetate dissimilation, not by metabolizing ethanol directly. We demonstrate that blood acetate concentrations are elevated during ethanol consumption. Finally, by increasing systemic acetate levels with glyceryl triacetate supplementation, we do not observe any impact on liver disease, but do induce similar gut microbiota alterations as chronic ethanol-feeding in mice. Our results show that ethanol is not directly metabolized by the gut microbiota, and changes in the gut microbiota linked to ethanol are a side effect of elevated acetate levels. De-trending for these acetate effects may be critical for understanding gut microbiota changes that cause alcohol-related liver disease.","Chronic alcohol use is associated with intestinal bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis, but the contribution of ethanol is unclear. Here, using mouse models, the authors find that ethanol is not directly metabolized by the gut microbiota, and that induced changes are rather a side effect of elevated acetate levels.",2022-08-08
887,Competing effects of vegetation density on sedimentation in deltaic marshes,"Marsh vegetation, a definitive component of delta ecosystems, has a strong effect on sediment retention and land-building, controlling both how much sediment can be delivered to and how much is retained by the marsh. An understanding of how vegetation influences these processes would improve the restoration and management of marshes. We use a random displacement model to simulate sediment transport, deposition, and resuspension within a marsh. As vegetation density increases, velocity declines, which reduces sediment supply to the marsh, but also reduces resuspension, which enhances sediment retention within the marsh. The competing trends of supply and retention produce a nonlinear relationship between sedimentation and vegetation density, such that an intermediate density yields the maximum sedimentation. Two patterns of sedimentation spatial distribution emerge in the simulation, and the exponential distribution only occurs when resuspension is absent. With resuspension, sediment is delivered farther into the marsh and in a uniform distribution. The model was validated with field observations of sedimentation response to seasonal variation in vegetation density observed in a marsh within the Mississippi River Delta.","Wetland vegetation is typically considered only in terms of enhancing sediment accretion and positively impacting land-building. Here, the authors show that the degree of enhancement has a strong dependence on vegetation density through the influence on sediment supply and retention.",2022-08-08
888,A quantitative analysis of various patterns applied in lattice light sheet microscopy,"Light sheet microscopes reduce phototoxicity and background and improve imaging speed compared to widefield and confocal microscopes. However, when equipped with Gaussian beams, the axial resolving power of a light sheet microscope and the observable field of view are inversely related. Light sheets based on dithered optical lattices improve axial resolution and beam uniformity compared Gaussian beams by using axially structured illumination patterns. However, these advantages come at the expense of an increased total illumination to the specimen and a decreased axial confinement of the illumination pattern. Using simulations and experimental measurements in fixed and live cells, we quantify the differences between Gaussian and lattice light sheets on beam uniformity, axial resolution, lateral resolution, and photobleaching. We demonstrate how different optical lattice illumination patterns can be tuned to prioritize either axial resolution or optical sectioning. Finally, we introduce an approach to spectrally fuse sequential acquisitions of different lattice light sheet patterns with complementary optical properties to achieve both high resolution and low background images.",Light sheet microscopes reduce phototoxicity and background while improving imaging speed compared to widefield and confocal microscopes. Here the authors quantify the differences between Gaussian and lattice light sheets using simulations and experimental data in fixed and live cells.,2022-08-08
889,Superfluid stiffness of a KTaO3-based two-dimensional electron gas,"After almost twenty years of intense work on the celebrated LaAlO3/SrTiO3system, the recent discovery of a superconducting two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) in (111)-oriented KTaO3-based heterostructures injects new momentum to the field of oxides interface. However, while both interfaces share common properties, experiments also suggest important differences between the two systems. Here, we report gate tunable superconductivity in 2-DEGs generated at the surface of a (111)-oriented KTaO3 crystal by the simple sputtering of a thin Al layer. We extract the superfluid stiffness of the 2-DEGs and show that its temperature dependence is consistent with a node-less superconducting order parameter having a gap value larger than expected within a simple BCS weak-coupling limit model. The superconducting transition follows the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless scenario, which was not reported on SrTiO3-based interfaces. Our finding offers innovative perspectives for fundamental science but also for device applications in a variety of fields such as spin-orbitronics and topological electronics.","Heterostructures based on (111)-oriented KTaO3crystals are a new platform for studying oxide interfaces. Gate-tunable superconductivity in 2D electron gases at the surface of (111)-oriented KTaO3is now reported, with the superconducting transition being of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type.",2022-08-08
890,Native metabolomics identifies the rivulariapeptolide family of protease inhibitors,"The identity and biological activity of most metabolites still remain unknown. A bottleneck in the exploration of metabolite structures and pharmaceutical activities is the compound purification needed for bioactivity assignments and downstream structure elucidation. To enable bioactivity-focused compound identification from complex mixtures, we develop a scalable native metabolomics approach that integrates non-targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and detection of protein binding via native mass spectrometry. A native metabolomics screen for protease inhibitors from an environmental cyanobacteria community reveals 30 chymotrypsin-binding cyclodepsipeptides. Guided by the native metabolomics results, we select and purify five of these compounds for full structure elucidation via tandem mass spectrometry, chemical derivatization, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as evaluation of their biological activities. These results identify rivulariapeptolides as a family of serine protease inhibitors with nanomolar potency, highlighting native metabolomics as a promising approach for drug discovery, chemical ecology, and chemical biology studies.","Bioactivity-guided isolation of specialized metabolites is an iterative process. Here, the authors demonstrate a native metabolomics approach that allows for fast screening of complex metabolite extracts against a protein of interest and simultaneous structure annotation.",2022-08-08
891,A neural circuit for wind-guided olfactory navigation,"To navigate towards a food source, animals frequently combine odor cues about source identity with wind direction cues about source location. Where and how these two cues are integrated to support navigation is unclear. Here we describe a pathway to the Drosophila fan-shaped body that encodes attractive odor and promotes upwind navigation. We show that neurons throughout this pathway encode odor, but not wind direction. Using connectomics, we identify fan-shaped body local neurons called h∆C that receive input from this odor pathway and a previously described wind pathway. We show that h∆C neurons exhibit odor-gated, wind direction-tuned activity, that sparse activation of h∆C neurons promotes navigation in a reproducible direction, and that h∆C activity is required for persistent upwind orientation during odor. Based on connectome data, we develop a computational model showing how h∆C activity can promote navigation towards a goal such as an upwind odor source. Our results suggest that odor and wind cues are processed by separate pathways and integrated within the fan-shaped body to support goal-directed navigation.","Flies navigate to food sources by combining odour and wind-direction cues. This study identifies pathways to the fan-shaped body that encode these signals, and demonstrates how local neurons integrate odour- and wind information to guide navigation.",2022-08-08
892,Boosting the stability of perovskites with exsolved nanoparticles by B-site supplement mechanism,"Perovskites with exsolved nanoparticles (P-eNs) have immense potentials for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction in solid oxide electrolysis cell. Despite the recent achievements in promoting the B-site cation exsolution for enhanced catalytic activities, the unsatisfactory stability of P-eNs at high voltages greatly impedes their practical applications and this issue has not been elucidated. In this study, we reveal that the formation of B-site vacancies in perovskite scaffold is the major contributor to the degradation of P-eNs; we then address this issue by fine-regulating the B-site supplement of the reduced Sr2Fe1.3Ni0.2Mo0.5O6-δ using foreign Fe sources, achieving a robust perovskite scaffold and prolonged stability performance. Furthermore, the degradation mechanism from the perspective of structure stability of perovskite has also been proposed to understand the origins of performance deterioration. The B-site supplement endows P-eNs with the capability to become appealing electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction and more broadly, for other energy storage and conversion systems.","The instability of perovskites with exsolved nanoparticles for CO2 electrocatalysis impedes their practical applications. Here, the authors show the formation of B-site vacancies in perovskite substrate as a major contributor to the degradation and report a strategy to enhance the stability of the perovskites at high voltages.",2022-08-08
893,Searching for ultra-light bosons and constraining black hole spin distributions with stellar tidal disruption events,"Stars that pass close to the supermassive black holes located in the center of galaxies can be disrupted by tidal forces, leading to flares that are observed as bright transient events in sky surveys. The rate for these events to occur depends on the black hole spins, which in turn can be affected by ultra-light bosons due to superradiance. We perform a detailed analysis of these effects and show that searches for stellar tidal disruptions have the potential to uncover the existence of ultra-light bosons. In particular, we find that upcoming stellar tidal disruption rate measurements by the Vera Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time can be used to either discover or rule out bosons with masses ranging from 10−20 to 10−18 eV. Our analysis also indicates that these measurements may be used to constrain a variety of supermassive black hole spin distributions and determine if close-to maximal spins are preferred.","Stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes. Here, the authors show that future searches TDEs have potential to uncover the existence of ultralight bosons.",2022-08-08
894,Unified classification and risk-stratification in Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"Clinical recommendations for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) classification and risk-stratification remain heavily reliant on cytogenetic findings at diagnosis, which are present in <50% of patients. Using comprehensive molecular profiling data from 3,653 patients we characterize and validate 16 molecular classes describing 100% of AML patients. Each class represents diverse biological AML subgroups, and is associated with distinct clinical presentation, likelihood of response to induction chemotherapy, risk of relapse and death over time. Secondary AML-2, emerges as the second largest class (24%), associates with high-risk disease, poor prognosis irrespective of flow Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity, and derives significant benefit from transplantation. Guided by class membership we derive a 3-tier risk-stratification score that re-stratifies 26% of patients as compared to standard of care. This results in a unified framework for disease classification and risk-stratification in AML that relies on information from cytogenetics and 32 genes. Last, we develop an open-access patient-tailored clinical decision support tool.","Classification and risk-stratification for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) at diagnosis are primarily based on cytogenetics and only a few gene mutations. Here, the authors study the genomic landscape of 3653 AML patients and characterize 16 non-overlapping molecular subgroups of clinical relevance for disease classification and risk prognostication.",2022-08-08
895,Electrically tunable two-dimensional heterojunctions for miniaturized near-infrared spectrometers,"Miniaturized spectrometers are of considerable interest for their portability. Most designs to date employ a photodetector array with distinct spectral responses or require elaborated integration of micro & nano optic modules, typically with a centimeter-scale footprint. Here, we report a design of a micron-sized near-infrared ultra-miniaturized spectrometer based on two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure (2D-vdWH). By introducing heavy metal atoms with delocalized electronic orbitals between 2D-vdWHs, we greatly enhance the interlayer coupling and realize electrically tunable infrared photoresponse (1.15 to 1.47 μm). Combining the gate-tunable photoresponse and regression algorithm, we achieve spectral reconstruction and spectral imaging in a device with an active footprint < 10 μm. Considering the ultra-small footprint and simple fabrication process, the 2D-vdWHs with designable bandgap energy and enhanced photoresponse offer an attractive solution for on-chip infrared spectroscopy.","Miniaturized infrared spectrometers are required for imaging and remote sensing applications, but they are usually characterized by a cm-scale footprint.

896,FERARI and cargo adaptors coordinate cargo flow through sorting endosomes,"Cellular organization, compartmentalization and cell-to-cell communication are crucially dependent on endosomal pathways. Sorting endosomes provide a transit point for various trafficking pathways and decide the fate of proteins: recycling, secretion or degradation. FERARI (Factors for Endosome Recycling and Rab Interactions) play a key role in shaping these compartments and coordinate Rab GTPase function with membrane fusion and fission of vesicles through a kiss-and-run mechanism. Here, we show that FERARI also mediate kiss-and-run of Rab5-positive vesicles with sorting endosomes. During these encounters, cargo flows from Rab5-positive vesicles into sorting endosomes and from there in Rab11-positive vesicles. Cargo flow from sorting endosomes into Rab11 structures relies on the cargo adaptor SNX6, while cargo retention in the Rab11 compartment is dependent on AP1. The available cargo amount appears to regulate the duration of kisses. We propose that FERARI, together with cargo adaptors, coordinate the vectorial flow of cargo through sorting endosomes.","It is estimated that about 80% of endocytosed material is recycled back to the plasma membrane. Here, the authors show that kiss-and-run of Rab5 early endocytic and Rab11 recycling vesicles on sorting endosomes allow cargo flow, providing more robustness and fidelity to the sorting process.",2022-08-08
897,Scarf enables a highly memory-efficient analysis of large-scale single-cell genomics data,"As the scale of single-cell genomics experiments grows into the millions, the computational requirements to process this data are beyond the reach of many. Herein we present Scarf, a modularly designed Python package that seamlessly interoperates with other single-cell toolkits and allows for memory-efficient single-cell analysis of millions of cells on a laptop or low-cost devices like single-board computers. We demonstrate Scarf’s memory and compute-time efficiency by applying it to the largest existing single-cell RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets. Scarf wraps memory-efficient implementations of a graph-based t-stochastic neighbour embedding and hierarchical clustering algorithm. Moreover, Scarf performs accurate reference-anchored mapping of datasets while maintaining memory efficiency. By implementing a subsampling algorithm, Scarf additionally has the capacity to generate representative sampling of cells from a given dataset wherein rare cell populations and lineage differentiation trajectories are conserved. Together, Scarf provides a framework wherein any researcher can perform advanced processing, subsampling, reanalysis, and integration of atlas-scale datasets on standard laptop computers. Scarf is available on Github: https://github.com/parashardhapola/scarf.","As the scale of single-cell genomics experiments grows into the millions, the computational requirements to process this data are beyond the reach of many. Here the authors present Scarf, a modularly designed Python package that makes the analysis workflow highly memory efficient such that even the largest existing datasets can be analyzed on an average modern laptop.",2022-08-08
898,Proteomic characterization of the Toxoplasma gondii cytokinesis machinery portrays an expanded hierarchy of its assembly and function,"The basal complex (BC) is essential for T. gondii cell division but mechanistic details are lacking. Here we report a reciprocal proximity based biotinylation approach to map the BC’s proteome. We interrogate the resulting map for spatiotemporal dynamics and function by disrupting the expression of components. This highlights four architecturally distinct BC subcomplexes, the compositions of which change dynamically in correlation with changes in BC function. We identify BCC0 as a protein undergirding BC formation in five foci that precede the same symmetry seen in the apical annuli and IMC sutures. Notably, daughter budding from BCC0 progresses bidirectionally: the apical cap in apical and the rest of the IMC in basal direction. Furthermore, the essential role of the BC in cell division is contained in BCC4 and MORN1 that form a ‘rubber band’ to sequester the basal end of the assembling daughter cytoskeleton. Finally, we assign BCC1 to the non-essential, final BC constriction step.","The basal complex is orchestrating Toxoplasma gondii cell division steps. Here, the authors use proximity biotinylation to map the proteome of this contractile ring, identify components acting on its formation, stability and constriction, and reveal bidirectional daughter budding.",2022-08-08
899,Measuring anion binding at biomembrane interfaces,"The quantification of anion binding by molecular receptors within lipid bilayers remains challenging. Here we measure anion binding in lipid bilayers by creating a fluorescent macrocycle featuring a strong sulfate affinity. We find the determinants of anion binding in lipid bilayers to be different from those expected that govern anion binding in solution. Charge-dense anions H2PO4– and Cl– that prevail in dimethyl sulfoxide fail to bind to the macrocycle in lipids. In stark contrast, ClO4– and I– that hardly bind in dimethyl sulfoxide show surprisingly significant affinities for the macrocycle in lipids. We reveal a lipid bilayer anion binding principle that depends on anion polarisability and bilayer penetration depth of complexes leading to unexpected advantages of charge-diffuse anions. These insights enhance our understanding of how biological systems select anions and guide the design of functional molecular systems operating at biomembrane interfaces.","Quantification of anion binding by molecular receptors within lipid bilayers is challenging. Here, the authors synthesise a high-affinity macrocyclic anion receptor which provides insights into determinants of anion binding within lipid bilayers.",2022-08-08
900,Photonic crystal enhanced fluorescence emission and blinking suppression for single quantum dot digital resolution biosensing,"While nanoscale quantum emitters are effective tags for measuring biomolecular interactions, their utilities for applications that demand single-unit observations are limited by the requirements for large numerical aperture (NA) objectives, fluorescence intermittency, and poor photon collection efficiency resulted from omnidirectional emission. Here, we report a nearly 3000-fold signal enhancement achieved through multiplicative effects of enhanced excitation, highly directional extraction, quantum efficiency improvement, and blinking suppression through a photonic crystal (PC) surface. The approach achieves single quantum dot (QD) sensitivity with high signal-to-noise ratio, even when using a low-NA lens and an inexpensive optical setup. The blinking suppression capability of the PC improves the QDs on-time from 15% to 85% ameliorating signal intermittency. We developed an assay for cancer-associated miRNA biomarkers with single-molecule resolution, single-base mutation selectivity, and 10-attomolar detection limit. Additionally, we observed differential surface motion trajectories of QDs when their surface attachment stringency is altered by changing a single base in a cancer-specific miRNA sequence.","Nanoscale emitters are useful for measuring biomolecular interactions, but are limited by weak signals. Here, the authors use a photonic crystal surface for 3000-fold signal enhancement, achieving single emitter sensitivity with extended on-time, and demonstrate its application in miRNA biomarker sensing.",2022-08-08
901,Systematic evidence and gap map of research linking food security and nutrition to mental health,"Connections between food security and nutrition (FSN) and mental health have been analytically investigated, but conclusions are difficult to draw given the breadth of literature. Furthermore, there is little guidance for continued research. We searched three databases for analytical studies linking FSN to mental health. Out of 30,896 records, we characterized and mapped 1945 studies onto an interactive Evidence and Gap Map (EGM). In these studies, anthropometry (especially BMI) and diets were most linked to mental health (predominantly depression). There were fewer studies on infant and young child feeding, birth outcomes, and nutrient biomarkers related to anxiety, stress, and mental well-being. Two-thirds of studies hypothesized FSN measures as the exposure influencing mental health outcomes. Most studies were observational, followed by systematic reviews as the next largest category of study. One-third of studies were carried out in low- and middle-income countries. This map visualizes the extent and nature of analytical studies relating FSN to mental health and may be useful in guiding future research.","There is a broad range of research available on the relationship between food security and mental health. Here the authors carry out a systematic mapping of evidence on food security and nutrition related to mental health and identifies trends in themes, setting, and study design over the 20 year period studied.",2022-08-08
902,Development of high-energy non-aqueous lithium-sulfur batteries via redox-active interlayer strategy,"Lithium-sulfur batteries have theoretical specific energy higher than state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. However, from a practical perspective, these batteries exhibit poor cycle life and low energy content owing to the polysulfides shuttling during cycling. To tackle these issues, researchers proposed the use of redox-inactive protective layers between the sulfur-containing cathode and lithium metal anode. However, these interlayers provide additional weight to the cell, thus, decreasing the practical specific energy. Here, we report the development and testing of redox-active interlayers consisting of sulfur-impregnated polar ordered mesoporous silica. Differently from redox-inactive interlayers, these redox-active interlayers enable the electrochemical reactivation of the soluble polysulfides, protect the lithium metal electrode from detrimental reactions via silica-polysulfide polar-polar interactions and increase the cell capacity. Indeed, when tested in a non-aqueous Li-S coin cell configuration, the use of the interlayer enables an initial discharge capacity of about 8.5 mAh cm−2 (for a total sulfur mass loading of 10 mg cm−2) and a discharge capacity retention of about 64 % after 700 cycles at 335 mA g−1 and 25 °C.","Lithium-sulfur batteries promise high energy density, but polysulfide shuttling acts as a major stumbling block toward practical development. Here, a redox-active interlayer is proposed to confine polysulfides, increase the cell capacity and improve cell cycle life.",2022-08-08
903,Blocking ActRIIB and restoring appetite reverses cachexia and improves survival in mice with lung cancer,"Cancer cachexia is a common, debilitating condition with limited therapeutic options. Using an established mouse model of lung cancer, we find that cachexia is characterized by reduced food intake, spontaneous activity, and energy expenditure accompanied by muscle metabolic dysfunction and atrophy. We identify Activin A as a purported driver of cachexia and treat with ActRIIB-Fc, a decoy ligand for TGF-β/activin family members, together with anamorelin (Ana), a ghrelin receptor agonist, to reverse muscle dysfunction and anorexia, respectively. Ana effectively increases food intake but only the combination of drugs increases lean mass, restores spontaneous activity, and improves overall survival. These beneficial effects are limited to female mice and are dependent on ovarian function. In agreement, high expression of Activin A in human lung adenocarcinoma correlates with unfavorable prognosis only in female patients, despite similar expression levels in both sexes. This study suggests that multimodal, sex-specific, therapies are needed to reverse cachexia.","Cancer-associated cachexia is characterized by loss of body weight, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue which relates to higher mortality in cancer patients. Here, the authors show in a lung cancer murine model that both ActRIIB signalling inhibition and restoring appetite are necessary to revert cachexia and improve survival in female mice.",2022-08-08
904,ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) or nCoV-19-Beta (AZD2816) protect Syrian hamsters against Beta Delta and Omicron variants,"ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is a replication-deficient simian adenovirus–vectored vaccine encoding the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, based on the first published full-length sequence (Wuhan-1). AZD1222 has been shown to have 74% vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease in clinical trials. However, variants of concern (VoCs) have been detected, with substitutions that are associated with a reduction in virus neutralizing antibody titer. Updating vaccines to include S proteins of VoCs may be beneficial, even though current real-world data is suggesting good efficacy following boosting with vaccines encoding the ancestral S protein. Using the Syrian hamster model, we evaluate the effect of a single dose of AZD2816, encoding the S protein of the Beta VoC, and efficacy of AZD1222/AZD2816 as a heterologous primary series against challenge with the Beta or Delta variant. Minimal to no viral sgRNA could be detected in lungs of vaccinated animals obtained at 3- or 5- days post inoculation, in contrast to lungs of control animals. In Omicron-challenged hamsters, a single dose of AZD2816 or AZD1222 reduced virus shedding. Thus, these vaccination regimens are protective against the Beta, Delta, and Omicron VoCs in the hamster model.","Whilst the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine has demonstrated efficacy against symptomatic disease, variants of concern (VOCs) with spike protein substitutions have led researchers to explore updating vaccines from ancestral spike protein. Authors use a Syrian hamster model to evaluate a vaccine encoding the spike protein of Beta VOC and assess efficacy against VOCs.",2022-08-08
905,A long-acting formulation of rifabutin is effective for prevention and treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Successful treatment requires strict adherence to drug regimens for prolonged periods of time. Long-acting (LA) delivery systems have the potential to improve adherence. Here, we show the development of LA injectable drug formulations of the anti-TB drug rifabutin made of biodegradable polymers and biocompatible solvents that solidifies after subcutaneous injection. Addition of amphiphilic compounds increases drug solubility, allowing to significantly increase formulation drug load. Solidified implants have organized microstructures that change with formulation composition. Higher drug load results in smaller pore size that alters implant erosion and allows sustained drug release. The translational relevance of these observations in BALB/c mice is demonstrated by (1) delivering high plasma drug concentrations for 16 weeks, (2) preventing acquisition of Mtb infection, and (3) clearing acute Mtb infection from the lung and other tissues.","Non-adherence to anti-tubercular therapy Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection can lead to treatment failure and even the development of drug resistance. In this work, the authors develop a long-acting delivery system of the anti-tuberculosis drug rifabutin and assess translational potential in vivo.",2022-08-08
906,Space-time monitoring of groundwater fluctuations with passive seismic interferometry,"Historic levels of drought, globally, call for sustainable freshwater management. Under pressing demand is a refined understanding of the structures and dynamics of groundwater systems. Here we present an unconventional, cost-effective approach to aquifer monitoring using seismograph arrays. Employing advanced seismic interferometry techniques, we calculate the space-time evolution of relative changes in seismic velocity, as a measure of hydrological properties. During 2000–2020 in basins near Los Angeles, seismic velocity variations match groundwater tables measured in wells and surface deformations inferred from satellite sensing, but the seismological approach adds temporal and depth resolutions for deep structures and processes. Maps of long-term seismic velocity changes reveal distinct patterns (decline or recovery) of groundwater storage in basins that are adjacent but adjudicated to water districts conducting different pumping practices. This pilot application bridges the gap between seismology and hydrology, and shows the promise of leveraging seismometers worldwide to provide 4D characterizations of groundwater and other near-surface systems.","Characterization of groundwater systems is important for sustainable freshwater management. Here, the authors map the distribution of groundwater storage changes at several hundred meters below the metropolitan Los Angeles during 2000–2020, by developing a cost-effective method using ambient ground vibrations recorded by seismometers.",2022-08-08
907,"Antibody affinity and cross-variant neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3 following third mRNA vaccination","There is limited knowledge on durability of neutralization capacity and antibody affinity maturation generated following two versus three doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in naïve versus convalescent individuals (hybrid immunity) against the highly transmissible Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3 subvariants. Virus neutralization titers against the vaccine-homologous strain (WA1) and Omicron sublineages are measured in a pseudovirus neutralization assay (PsVNA). In addition, antibody binding and antibody affinity against spike proteins from WA1, BA.1, and BA.2 is determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The convalescent individuals who after SARS-CoV-2 infection got vaccinated develop hybrid immunity that shows broader neutralization activity and cross-reactive antibody affinity maturation against the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 after either second or third vaccination compared with naïve individuals. Neutralization activity correlates with antibody affinity against Omicron subvariants BA.1 and BA.2 spikes. Importantly, at four months post-third vaccination the neutralization activity and antibody affinity against the Omicron subvariants is maintained and trended higher for the individuals with hybrid immunity compared with naïve adults. These findings about hybrid immunity resulting in superior immune kinetics, breadth, and durable high affinity antibodies support the need for booster vaccinations to provide effective protection from emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants like the rapidly spreading Omicron subvariants.",Here the authors show that a third SARS-CoV-2 vaccination significantly boosts neutralizing antibodies against Omicron subvariants and that hybrid immunity (infection and vaccination) results in broader neutralization activity and cross-reactive antibody affinity maturation.,2022-08-08
908,Anomalous Ferromagnetism of quasiparticle doped holes in cuprate heterostructures revealed using resonant soft X-ray magnetic scattering,"We report strong ferromagnetism of quasiparticle doped holes both within the ab-plane and along the c-axis of Cu-O planes in low-dimensional Au/d-La1.8Ba0.2CuO4/LaAlO3(001) heterostructures (d = 4, 8 and 12 unit-cells) using resonant soft X-ray and magnetic scattering together with X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. Interestingly, ferromagnetism is stronger at a hole doped peak and at an upper Hubbard band of O with spin-polarization degree as high as 40%, revealing strong ferromagnetism of Mottness. For in-ab-plane spin-polarizations, the spin of doped holes in O2p–Cu3d–O2p is a triplet state yielding strong ferromagnetism. For out-of-ab-plane spin-polarization, while the spins of doped holes in both O2p–O2p and Cu3d–Cu3d are triplet states, the spin of doped holes in Cu3d–O2p is a singlet state yielding ferrimagnetism. A ferromagnetic-(002) Bragg-peak of the doped holes is observed and enhanced as a function of d revealing strong ferromagnetism coupling between Cu-O layers along the c-axis.","Long-range magnetic order of quasiparticle doped holes is important for understanding the physics of cuprate superconductors, albeit difficult to probe in experiments. Ong et al. observe ferromagnetism of quasiparticle doped holes in a cuprate heterostructure and discuss implications for cuprates in the ground state.",2022-08-08
909,Contrasting inequality in human exposure to greenspace between cities of Global North and Global South,"The United Nations specified the need for “providing universal access to greenspace for urban residents” in the 11th Sustainable Development Goal. Yet, how far we are from this goal remains unclear. Here, we develop a methodology incorporating fine-resolution population and greenspace mappings and use the results for 2020 to elucidate global differences in human exposure to greenspace. We identify a contrasting difference of greenspace exposure between Global South and North cities. Global South cities experience only one third of the greenspace exposure level of Global North cities. Greenspace exposure inequality (Gini: 0.47) in Global South cities is nearly twice that of Global North cities (Gini: 0.27). We quantify that 22% of the spatial disparity is associated with greenspace provision, and 53% is associated with joint effects of greenspace provision and spatial configuration. These findings highlight the need for prioritizing greening policies to mitigate environmental disparity and achieve sustainable development goals.","Through an analysis of global differences in human exposure to greenspace, a new study identifies a contrasting pattern of greenspace exposure between Global South and North cities and finds seasonal variations in greenspace exposure inequality.",2022-08-08
910,Programmable RNA targeting by bacterial Argonaute nucleases with unconventional guide binding and cleavage specificity,"Argonaute proteins are programmable nucleases that have defense and regulatory functions in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. All known prokaryotic Argonautes (pAgos) characterized so far act on DNA targets. Here, we describe a new class of pAgos that uniquely use DNA guides to process RNA targets. The biochemical and structural analysis of Pseudooceanicola lipolyticus pAgo (PliAgo) reveals an unusual organization of the guide binding pocket that does not rely on divalent cations and the canonical set of contacts for 5’-end interactions. Unconventional interactions of PliAgo with the 5’-phosphate of guide DNA define its new position within pAgo and shift the site of target RNA cleavage in comparison with known Argonautes. The specificity for RNA over DNA is defined by ribonucleotide residues at the cleavage site. The analysed pAgos sense mismatches and modifications in the RNA target. The results broaden our understanding of prokaryotic defense systems and extend the spectrum of programmable nucleases with potential use in RNA technology.","The authors describe programmable Argonaute nucleases that use small DNA guides to recognize and cleave RNA targets and can sense mismatches and modifications in RNA targets, making them potential tools for RNA biotechnology.",2022-08-08
911,Lower vaccine-acquired immunity in the elderly population following two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination is alleviated by a third vaccine dose,"Understanding the impact of age on vaccinations is essential for the design and delivery of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present findings from a comprehensive analysis of multiple compartments of the memory immune response in 312 individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Two vaccine doses induce high antibody and T cell responses in most individuals. However, antibody recognition of the Spike protein of the Delta and Omicron variants is less efficient than that of the ancestral Wuhan strain. Age-stratified analyses identify a group of low antibody responders where individuals ≥60 years are overrepresented. Waning of the antibody and cellular responses is observed in 30% of the vaccinees after 6 months. However, age does not influence the waning of these responses. Taken together, while individuals ≥60 years old take longer to acquire vaccine-induced immunity, they develop more sustained acquired immunity at 6 months post-vaccination. A third dose strongly boosts the low antibody responses in the older individuals against the ancestral Wuhan strain, Delta and Omicron variants.",Responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in different populations are important to define efficacy. Here the authors show using a cohort in Singapore that two doses of mRNA vaccine is less effective in recipients over 60 years of age and that a further dose of vaccine can improve these antibody levels.,2022-08-08
912,G protein coupling and activation of the metabotropic GABAB heterodimer,"Metabotropic γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABABR), a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heterodimer, plays a crucial role in the central nervous system. Cryo-electron microscopy studies revealed a drastic conformational change upon activation and a unique G protein (GP) binding mode. However, little is known about the mechanism for GP coupling and activation for class C GPCRs. Here, we use molecular metadynamics computations to predict the mechanism by which the inactive GP induces conformational changes in the GABABR transmembrane domain (TMD) to form an intermediate pre-activated state. We find that the inactive GP first interacts with TM3, which further leads to the TMD rearrangement and deeper insertion of the α5 helix that causes the Gα subunit to open, releasing GDP, and forming the experimentally observed activated structure. This mechanism provides fresh insights into the mechanistic details of class C GPCRs activation expected to be useful for designing selective agonists and antagonists.","Despite its crucial role in the central nervous system, little is known about the activation mechanism of GABAB receptor. Here, the authors predict that the inactive G protein induces conformational changes of the receptor to form an intermediate state.",2022-08-08
913,Adaptation to chronic ER stress enforces pancreatic β-cell plasticity,"Pancreatic β-cells are prone to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due to their role in insulin secretion. They require sustainable and efficient adaptive stress responses to cope with this stress. Whether episodes of chronic stress directly compromise β-cell identity is unknown. We show here under reversible, chronic stress conditions β-cells undergo transcriptional and translational reprogramming associated with impaired expression of regulators of β-cell function and identity. Upon recovery from stress, β-cells regain their identity and function, indicating a high degree of adaptive plasticity. Remarkably, while β-cells show resilience to episodic ER stress, when episodes exceed a threshold, β-cell identity is gradually lost. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of islets from type 1 diabetes patients indicates severe deregulation of the chronic stress-adaptation program and reveals novel biomarkers of diabetes progression. Our results suggest β-cell adaptive exhaustion contributes to diabetes pathogenesis.","Pancreatic β-cells are naturally prone to ER stress due to their role in insulin production and secretion. Here, the authors show that chronic ER stress adaptive exhaustion results in an irreversible loss of β-cell function leading to T1D pathogenesis",2022-08-08
914,COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine induces transient CD8+ T effector cell responses while conserving the memory pool for subsequent reactivation,"Immunization with two mRNA vaccine doses elicits robust spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses, but reports of waning immunity after COVID-19 vaccination prompt the introduction of booster vaccination campaigns. However, the effect of mRNA booster vaccination on the spike-specific CD8+ T cell response remains unclear. Here we show that spike-specific CD8+ T cells are activated and expanded in all analyzed individuals receiving the 3rd and 4th mRNA vaccine shots. This CD8+ T cell boost response is followed by a contraction phase and lasts only for about 30-60 days. The spike-specific CD8+ T memory stem cell pool is not affected by the 3rd vaccination. Both 4th vaccination and breakthrough infections with Delta and Omicron rapidly reactivate CD8+ T memory cells. In contrast, neutralizing antibody responses display little boost effect towards Omicron. Thus, COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccination elicits a transient T effector cell response while long-term spike-specific CD8+ T cell immunity is conserved to mount robust memory recall targeting emerging variants of concern.","Vaccines induce beneficial immunity for COVID-19, but immune waning prompts boosting vaccination. Here, the authors show that a third, boosting dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine induces transient CD8 + T effector cell response while conserving the CD8 memory T cell pool, thereby permitting reactivation of spike-specific CD8 + T cells upon breakthrough infection or 4th vaccination.",2022-08-08
915,IFN-γ stimulated murine and human neurons mount anti-parasitic defenses against the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii,"Dogma holds that Toxoplasma gondii persists in neurons because neurons cannot clear intracellular parasites, even with IFN-γ stimulation. As several recent studies questioned this idea, here we use primary murine neuronal cultures from wild type and transgenic mice in combination with IFN-γ stimulation and parental and transgenic parasites to reassess IFN-γ dependent neuronal clearance of intracellular parasites. We find that neurons respond to IFN-γ and that a subset of neurons clear intracellular parasites via immunity regulated GTPases. Whole neuron reconstructions from mice infected with parasites that trigger neuron GFP expression only after full invasion reveal that ~50% of these T. gondii-invaded neurons no longer harbor parasites. Finally, IFN-γ stimulated human pluripotent stem cell derived neurons show an ~50% decrease in parasite infection rate when compared to unstimulated cultures. This work highlights the capability of human and murine neurons to mount cytokine-dependent anti-T. gondii defense mechanisms in vitro and in vivo.","Toxoplasma gondii can persist in neurons in the central nervous system, presumably because neurons have limited cell-intrinsic immune responses. However, here, Chandrasekaran et al. show that IFN-gamma stimulated primary murine neurons can clear T. gondii and that IFN-gamma stimulated murine and human neurons show decreased infection rates.",2022-08-08
916,Realization of unpinned two-dimensional dirac states in antimony atomic layers,"Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac states with linear dispersion have been observed in graphene and on the surface of topological insulators. 2D Dirac states discovered so far are exclusively pinned at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, for example, surface Dirac states at \(\overline{{{\Gamma }}}\) in topological insulators Bi2Se(Te)3 and Dirac cones at K and \(K^{\prime}\) points in graphene. The low-energy dispersion of those Dirac states are isotropic due to the constraints of crystal symmetries. In this work, we report the observation of novel 2D Dirac states in antimony atomic layers with phosphorene structure. The Dirac states in the antimony films are located at generic momentum points. This unpinned nature enables versatile ways such as lattice strains to control the locations of the Dirac points in momentum space. In addition, dispersions around the unpinned Dirac points are highly anisotropic due to the reduced symmetry of generic momentum points. The exotic properties of unpinned Dirac states make antimony atomic layers a new type of 2D Dirac semimetals that are distinct from graphene.","In graphene and on the surfaces of many topological insulators, the Dirac cones are pinned to high symmetry points in reciprocal space. Here, the authors report that the Dirac cones in atomically-thin Sb layers occur at generic reciprocal-space points which can be tuned by lattice strain.",2022-08-06
917,Superconductivity from energy fluctuations in dilute quantum critical polar metals,"Superconductivity in low carrier density metals challenges the conventional electron-phonon theory due to the absence of retardation required to overcome Coulomb repulsion. Here we demonstrate that pairing mediated by energy fluctuations, ubiquitously present close to continuous phase transitions, occurs in dilute quantum critical polar metals and results in a dome-like dependence of the superconducting Tc on carrier density, characteristic of non-BCS superconductors. In quantum critical polar metals, the Coulomb repulsion is heavily screened, while the critical transverse optical phonons decouple from the electron charge. In the resulting vacuum, long-range attractive interactions emerge from the energy fluctuations of the critical phonons, resembling the gravitational interactions of a chargeless dark matter universe. Our estimates show that this mechanism may explain the critical temperatures observed in doped SrTiO3. We provide predictions for the enhancement of superconductivity near polar quantum criticality in two- and three-dimensional materials that can be used to test our theory.","Superconductivity in low-carrier-density polar metals, such as SrTiO3, challenges the conventional electron-phonon theory due to the absence of retardation required to overcome Coulomb repulsion. Here, the authors propose that energy fluctuations of quantum-critical phonons could account for the superconductivity of SrTiO3.",2022-08-06
918,NiPS3 ultrathin nanosheets as versatile platform advancing highly active photocatalytic H2 production,"High-performance and low-cost photocatalysts play the key role in achieving the large-scale solar hydrogen production. In this work, we report a liquid-exfoliation approach to prepare NiPS3 ultrathin nanosheets as a versatile platform to greatly improve the light-induced hydrogen production on various photocatalysts, including TiO2, CdS, In2ZnS4 and C3N4. The superb visible-light-induced hydrogen production rate (13,600 μmol h−1 g−1) is achieved on NiPS3/CdS hetero-junction with the highest improvement factor (~1,667%) compared with that of pure CdS. This significantly better performance is attributed to the strongly correlated NiPS3/CdS interface assuring efficient electron-hole dissociation/transport, as well as abundant atomic-level edge P/S sites and activated basal S sites on NiPS3 ultrathin nanosheets advancing hydrogen evolution. These findings are revealed by the state-of-art characterizations and theoretical computations. Our work for the first time demonstrates the great potential of metal phosphorous chalcogenide as a general platform to tremendously raise the performance of different photocatalysts.","While light-driven water splitting offers a renewable means to produce fuel, the limited availability of high-performance materials inspires the search for new photocatalysts.

919,Molecular mechanism for the synchronized electrostatic coacervation and co-aggregation of alpha-synuclein and tau,"Amyloid aggregation of α-synuclein (αS) is the hallmark of Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies. Recently, Tau protein, generally associated with Alzheimer’s disease, has been linked to αS pathology and observed to co-localize in αS-rich disease inclusions, although the molecular mechanisms for the co-aggregation of both proteins remain elusive. We report here that αS phase-separates into liquid condensates by electrostatic complex coacervation with positively charged polypeptides such as Tau. Condensates undergo either fast gelation or coalescence followed by slow amyloid aggregation depending on the affinity of αS for the poly-cation and the rate of valence exhaustion of the condensate network. By combining a set of advanced biophysical techniques, we have been able to characterize αS/Tau liquid-liquid phase separation and identified key factors that lead to the formation of hetero-aggregates containing both proteins in the interior of the liquid protein condensates.","Here, the authors report that α-synuclein phase-separates into liquid condensates with positively charged polypeptides such as Tau. The condensates undergo different maturation processes, including the formation of α-synuclein/Tau amyloid hetero-aggregates inside the condensates.",2022-08-06
920,Filming movies of attosecond charge migration in single molecules with high harmonic spectroscopy,"Electron migration in molecules is the progenitor of chemical reactions and biological functions after light-matter interaction. Following this ultrafast dynamics, however, has been an enduring endeavor. Here we demonstrate that, by using machine learning algorithm to analyze high-order harmonics generated by two-color laser pulses, we are able to retrieve the complex amplitudes and phases of harmonics of single fixed-in-space molecules. These complex dipoles enable us to construct movies of laser-driven electron migration after tunnel ionization of N2 and CO2 molecules at time steps of 50 attoseconds. Moreover, the angular dependence of the migration dynamics is fully resolved. By examining the movies, we observe that electron holes do not just migrate along the laser polarization direction, but may swirl around the atom centers. Our result establishes a general scheme for studying ultrafast electron dynamics in molecules, paving a way for further advance in tracing and controlling photochemical reactions by femtosecond lasers.",Seeing molecules in action under the influence of very short pulses is interesting. Here the authors demonstrate charge migration dynamics in molecules by using high harmonic spectroscopy and machine learning algorithm.,2022-08-06
921,Data-driven load profiles and the dynamics of residential electricity consumption,"The dynamics of power consumption constitutes an essential building block for planning and operating sustainable energy systems. Whereas variations in the dynamics of renewable energy generation are reasonably well studied, a deeper understanding of the variations in consumption dynamics is still missing. Here, we analyse highly resolved residential electricity consumption data of Austrian, German and UK households and propose a generally applicable data-driven load model. Specifically, we disentangle the average demand profiles from the demand fluctuations based purely on time series data. We introduce a stochastic model to quantitatively capture the highly intermittent demand fluctuations. Thereby, we offer a better understanding of demand dynamics, in particular its fluctuations, and provide general tools for disentangling mean demand and fluctuations for any given system, going beyond the standard load profile (SLP). Our insights on the demand dynamics may support planning and operating future-compliant (micro) grids in maintaining supply-demand balance.","In modern power grids, knowing the required electric power demand and its variations is necessary to balance demand and supply. The authors propose a data-driven approach to create high-resolution load profiles and characterize their fluctuations, based on recorded data of electricity consumption.",2022-08-06
922,A non-Hermitian optical atomic mirror,"Explorations of symmetry and topology have led to important breakthroughs in quantum optics, but much richer behaviors arise from the non-Hermitian nature of light-matter interactions. A high-reflectivity, non-Hermitian optical mirror can be realized by a two-dimensional subwavelength array of neutral atoms near the cooperative resonance associated with the collective dipole modes. Here we show that exceptional points develop from a nondefective degeneracy by lowering the crystal symmetry of a square atomic lattice, and dispersive bulk Fermi arcs that originate from exceptional points are truncated by the light cone. From its nontrivial energy spectra topology, we demonstrate that the geometry-dependent non-Hermitian skin effect emerges in a ribbon geometry. Furthermore, skin modes localized at a boundary show a scale-free behavior that stems from the long-range interaction and whose mechanism goes beyond the framework of non-Bloch band theory. Our work opens the door to the study of the interplay among non-Hermiticity, topology, and long-range interaction.","Here the authors provide a theoretical description of non-Hermitian topological phenomena in an atomic mirror. They find out diverse and unexpected phenomena by constructing an ad-hoc theoretical model. In particular, exceptional points, dispersive bulk Fermi arcs, and non-Hermitian geometry-dependent skin effect.",2022-08-06
923,Neutrophils restrain sepsis associated coagulopathy via extracellular vesicles carrying superoxide dismutase 2 in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide induced sepsis,"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis currently lacking effective therapeutic options. Excessive inflammatory responses are emerging triggers of coagulopathy during sepsis, but the interplay between the immune system and coagulation are not fully understood. Here we utilize a murine model of intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide stimulation and show neutrophils in the circulation mitigate the occurrence of DIC, preventing subsequent septic death. We show circulating neutrophils release extracellular vesicles containing mitochondria, which contain superoxide dismutase 2 upon exposure to lipopolysaccharide. Extracellular superoxide dismutase 2 is necessary to induce neutrophils’ antithrombotic function by preventing endothelial reactive oxygen species accumulation and alleviating endothelial dysfunction. Intervening endothelial reactive oxygen species accumulation by antioxidants significantly ameliorates disseminated intravascular coagulation improving survival in this murine model of lipopolysaccharide challenge. These findings reveal an interaction between neutrophils and vascular endothelium which critically regulate coagulation in a model of sepsis and may have potential implications for the management of disseminated intravascular coagulation.",Disseminated intravascular coagulation is associated with sepsis and a number of inflammatory components have been linked to sepsis associated coagulopathy. Here the authors show neutrophils can prevent lethal coagulopathy via the production of extracellular vesicles that carry superoxide dismutase 2 in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide induced sepsis.,2022-08-06
924,Electrically switched underwater capillary adhesion,"Developing underwater adhesives that can rapidly and reversibly switch the adhesion in wet conditions is important in various industrial and biomedical applications. Despite extensive progresses, the manifestation of underwater adhesion with rapid reversibility remains a big challenge. Here, we report a simple strategy that achieves strong underwater adhesion between two surfaces as well as rapid and reversible detachment in on-demand manner. Our approach leverages on the design of patterned hybrid wettability on surfaces that selectively creates a spatially confined integral air shell to preserve the water bridge in underwater environment. The overall adhesion strength can be multiplied by introducing multiple air shells and rapidly broken by disturbing the integrity of the protective air shell in response to the applied voltage on two surfaces. Our design can be constructed on the flexible substrate with hybrid wettability, which can be applied to non-conductive substrates and adapted to more complicated morphologies, extending the choice of underlying materials.","Wang et al. report an underwater capillary adhesive that is strengthened by the conjunction of inner water bridge and outer air shell, and switched timely by a small direct current voltage. The design can also be constructed on flexible tapes, which can be applied to non-conductive substrates.",2022-08-06
925,Phonon thermal Hall effect in a metallic spin ice,"It has become common knowledge that phonons can generate thermal Hall effect in a wide variety of materials, although the underlying mechanism is still controversial. We study longitudinal κxx and transverse κxy thermal conductivity in Pr2Ir2O7, which is a metallic analog of spin ice. Despite the presence of mobile charge carriers, we find that both κxx and κxy are dominated by phonons. A T/H scaling of κxx unambiguously reveals that longitudinal heat current is substantially impeded by resonant scattering of phonons on paramagnetic spins. Upon cooling, the resonant scattering is strongly affected by a development of spin ice correlation and κxx deviates from the scaling in an anisotropic way with respect to field directions. Strikingly, a set of the κxx and κxy data clearly shows that κxy correlates with κxx in its response to magnetic field including a success of the T/H scaling and its failure at low temperature. This remarkable correlation provides solid evidence that an indispensable role is played by spin-phonon scattering not only for hindering the longitudinal heat conduction, but also for generating the transverse response.","The thermal Hall effect, or a temperature gradient transverse to a heat current and a magnetic field, has been observed in many materials, but its mechanism is not fully understood. Uehara et al. demonstrate the dominant phonon contribution to both longitudinal and transverse thermal response in a metallic spin ice Pr2Ir2O7.",2022-08-06
926,The superconductivity of Sr2RuO4 under c-axis uniaxial stress,"Applying in-plane uniaxial pressure to strongly correlated low-dimensional systems has been shown to tune the electronic structure dramatically. For example, the unconventional superconductor Sr2RuO4 can be tuned through a single Van Hove point, resulting in strong enhancement of both Tc and Hc2. Out-of-plane (c axis) uniaxial pressure is expected to tune the quasi-two-dimensional structure even more strongly, by pushing it towards two Van Hove points simultaneously. Here, we achieve a record uniaxial stress of 3.2 GPa along the c axis of Sr2RuO4. Hc2 increases, as expected for increasing density of states, but unexpectedly Tc falls. As a first attempt to explain this result, we present three-dimensional calculations in the weak interaction limit. We find that within the weak-coupling framework there is no single order parameter that can account for the contrasting effects of in-plane versus c-axis uniaxial stress, which makes this new result a strong constraint on theories of the superconductivity of Sr2RuO4.","In the superconductor Sr2RuO4, in-plane strain is known to enhance both the superconducting transition temperature Tc and upper critical field Hc2, but the effect of out-of-plane strain has not been studied. Here, the authors find that Hc2 is enhanced under out-of-plane strain, but Tc unexpectedly decreases.",2022-08-06
927,Structural and dynamic mechanisms of GABAA receptor modulators with opposing activities,"γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels abundant in the central nervous system and are prolific drug targets for treating anxiety, sleep disorders and epilepsy. Diverse small molecules exert a spectrum of effects on γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors by acting at the classical benzodiazepine site. They can potentiate the response to GABA, attenuate channel activity, or counteract modulation by other ligands. Structural mechanisms underlying the actions of these drugs are not fully understood. Here we present two high-resolution structures of GABAA receptors in complex with zolpidem, a positive allosteric modulator and heavily prescribed hypnotic, and DMCM, a negative allosteric modulator with convulsant and anxiogenic properties. These two drugs share the extracellular benzodiazepine site at the α/γ subunit interface and two transmembrane sites at β/α interfaces. Structural analyses reveal a basis for the subtype selectivity of zolpidem that underlies its clinical success. Molecular dynamics simulations provide insight into how DMCM switches from a negative to a positive modulator as a function of binding site occupancy. Together, these findings expand our understanding of how GABAA receptor allosteric modulators acting through a common site can have diverging activities.","GABAA receptors are important targets for anxiety, sedation and anesthesia. Here, the authors present structures bound by zolpidem (Ambien), the most prescribed hypnotic in the US, and DMCM, a negative modulator, providing insights into receptor modulation.",2022-08-06
928,Narrative thinking lingers in spontaneous thought,"Some experiences linger in mind, spontaneously returning to our thoughts for minutes after their conclusion. Other experiences fall out of mind immediately. It remains unclear why. We hypothesize that an input is more likely to persist in our thoughts when it has been deeply processed: when we have extracted its situational meaning rather than its physical properties or low-level semantics. Here, participants read sequences of words with different levels of coherence (word-, sentence-, or narrative-level). We probe participants’ spontaneous thoughts via free word association, before and after reading. By measuring lingering subjectively (via self-report) and objectively (via changes in free association content), we find that information lingers when it is coherent at the narrative level. Furthermore, and an individual’s feeling of transportation into reading material predicts lingering better than the material’s objective coherence. Thus, our thoughts in the present moment echo prior experiences that have been incorporated into deeper, narrative forms of thinking.","Some experiences linger in our minds, while others quickly fade. Here, the authors show that the extent to which our recent experiences linger into subsequent thought increases as a function of processing depth.",2022-08-06
929,Insights into the activity of nickel boride/nickel heterostructures for efficient methanol electrooxidation,"Designing efficient catalysts and understanding the underlying mechanisms for anodic nucleophile electrooxidation are central to the advancement of electrochemically-driven technologies. Here, a heterostructure of nickel boride/nickel catalyst is developed to enable methanol electrooxidation into formate with a Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%. Operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy are applied to understand the influence of methanol concentration in the methanol oxidation reaction. High concentrations of methanol inhibit the phase transition of the electrocatalyst to high-valent electro-oxidation products, and electrophilic oxygen species (O* or OH*) formed on the electrocatalyst are considered to be the catalytically active species. Additional mechanistic investigation with density functional theory calculations reveals that the potential-determining step, the formation of *CH2O, occurs most favorably on the nickel boride/nickel heterostructure rather than on nickel boride and nickel. These results are highly instructive for the study of other nucleophile-based approaches to electrooxidation reactions and organic electrosynthesis.","Understanding the role of active sites in electrooxidation reactions is important yet challenging. Here, the authors use operando spectroscopies to monitor the effect of methanol concentration on Ni3B/Ni heterostructures during formate production.",2022-08-06
930,A single-cell atlas of the multicellular ecosystem of primary and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a paradigm of the relation between tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor development. Here, we generate a single-cell atlas of the multicellular ecosystem of HCC from four tissue sites. We show the enrichment of central memory T cells (TCM) in the early tertiary lymphoid structures (E-TLSs) in HCC and assess the relationships between chronic HBV/HCV infection and T cell infiltration and exhaustion. We find the MMP9+ macrophages to be terminally differentiated tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and PPARγ to be the pivotal transcription factor driving their differentiation. We also characterize the heterogeneous subpopulations of malignant hepatocytes and their multifaceted functions in shaping the immune microenvironment of HCC. Finally, we identify seven microenvironment-based subtypes that can predict prognosis of HCC patients. Collectively, this large-scale atlas deepens our understanding of the HCC microenvironment, which might facilitate the development of new immune therapy strategies for this malignancy.","The immune cell constituents and localisation within human hepatocellular carcinoma is not fully understood. Here the authors use single cell RNA sequencing of HCC from four different tissue sites and show differences between primary and metastatic tumours, tumour associated macrophages and immune cell populations.",2022-08-06
931,Inferring interiors and structural history of top-shaped asteroids from external properties of asteroid (101955) Bennu,"Asteroid interiors play a key role in our understanding of asteroid formation and evolution. As no direct interior probing has been done yet, characterisation of asteroids’ interiors relies on interpretations of external properties. Here we show, by numerical simulations, that the top-shaped rubble-pile asteroid (101955) Bennu’s geophysical response to spinup is highly sensitive to its material strength. This allows us to infer Bennu’s interior properties and provide general implications for top-shaped rubble piles’ structural evolution. We find that low-cohesion (≲0.78 Pa at surface and ≲1.3 Pa inside) and low-friction (friction angle ≲ 35∘) structures with several high-cohesion internal zones can consistently account for all the known geophysical characteristics of Bennu and explain the absence of moons. Furthermore, we reveal the underlying mechanisms that lead to different failure behaviours and identify the reconfiguration pathways of top-shaped asteroids as functions of their structural properties that either facilitate or prevent the formation of moons.","Asteroid interiors are key to understand their formation and evolution. Here, the authors show that numerically simulated low-cohesion and low-friction structures with several high-cohesion internal zones can explain asteroid Bennu’s geophysical characteristics and the absence of the moons.",2022-08-06
932,Three-dimensional imaging of waves and floes in the marginal ice zone during a cyclone,"The marginal ice zone is the dynamic interface between the open ocean and consolidated inner pack ice. Surface gravity waves regulate marginal ice zone extent and properties, and, hence, atmosphere-ocean fluxes and ice advance/retreat. Over the past decade, seminal experimental campaigns have generated much needed measurements of wave evolution in the marginal ice zone, which, notwithstanding the prominent knowledge gaps that remain, are underpinning major advances in understanding the region’s role in the climate system. Here, we report three-dimensional imaging of waves from a moving vessel and simultaneous imaging of floe sizes, with the potential to enhance the marginal ice zone database substantially. The images give the direction–frequency wave spectrum, which we combine with concurrent measurements of wind speeds and reanalysis products to reveal the complex multi-component wind-plus-swell nature of a cyclone-driven wave field, and quantify evolution of large-amplitude waves in sea ice.","Unprecedented 3D imaging of waves and sea ice floes from a moving icebreaker in the Antarctic marginal ice zone during a polar cyclone reveals a complex wind-plus-swell sea state, where contrasting ice-driven attenuation and wind forcing coexist.",2022-08-06
933,PCGF6 controls neuroectoderm specification of human pluripotent stem cells by activating SOX2 expression,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are known to repress developmental genes during embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Here, we report that PCGF6 controls neuroectoderm specification of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) by activating SOX2 gene. Human PSCs with PCGF6 depletion display impaired neuroectoderm differentiation coupled with increased mesendoderm outcomes. Transcriptome analysis reveals that de-repression of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway is responsible for the differentiation of PSC toward the mesendodermal lineage. Interestingly, PCGF6 and MYC directly interact and co-occupy a distal regulatory element of SOX2 to activate SOX2 expression, which likely accounts for the regulation in neuroectoderm differentiation. Supporting this notion, genomic deletion of the SOX2-regulatory element phenocopies the impaired neuroectoderm differentiation, while overexpressing SOX2 rescues the neuroectoderm phenotype caused by PCGF6-depletion. Together, our study reveals that PCGF6 can function as lineage switcher between mesendoderm and neuroectoderm in human PSCs by both suppression and activation mechanisms.",Variant Polycomb complexes can have tissue-specific roles during development. Here they show that PCGF6 controls lineage-specification in human PSCs by promoting neuroectoderm differentiation and repressing mesendoderm differentiation via distinct downstream targets.,2022-08-06
934,Temporal profiling of the breast tumour microenvironment reveals collagen XII as a driver of metastasis,"The tumour stroma, and in particular the extracellular matrix (ECM), is a salient feature of solid tumours that plays a crucial role in shaping their progression. Many desmoplastic tumours including breast cancer involve the significant accumulation of type I collagen. However, recently it has become clear that the precise distribution and organisation of matrix molecules such as collagen I is equally as important in the tumour as their abundance. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) coexist within breast cancer tissues and play both pro- and anti-tumourigenic roles through remodelling the ECM. Here, using temporal proteomic profiling of decellularized tumours, we interrogate the evolving matrisome during breast cancer progression. We identify 4 key matrisomal clusters, and pinpoint collagen type XII as a critical component that regulates collagen type I organisation. Through combining our proteomics with single-cell transcriptomics, and genetic manipulation models, we show how CAF-secreted collagen XII alters collagen I organisation to create a pro-invasive microenvironment supporting metastatic dissemination. Finally, we show in patient cohorts that collagen XII may represent an indicator of breast cancer patients at high risk of metastatic relapse.",The distribution and organisation of matrix molecules in the tumour stroma help shape solid tumour progression. Here they perform temporal proteomic profiling of the matrisome during breast cancer progression and show that collagen XII secreted from CAFs provides a pro-invasive microenvironment.,2022-08-06
935,Low-voltage ultrafast nonvolatile memory via direct charge injection through a threshold resistive-switching layer,"The explosion in demand for massive data processing and storage requires revolutionary memory technologies featuring ultrahigh speed, ultralong retention, ultrahigh capacity and ultralow energy consumption. Although a breakthrough in ultrafast floating-gate memory has been achieved very recently, it still suffers a high operation voltage (tens of volts) due to the Fowler–Nordheim tunnelling mechanism. It is still a great challenge to realize ultrafast nonvolatile storage with low operation voltage. Here we propose a floating-gate memory with a structure of MoS2/hBN/MoS2/graphdiyne oxide/WSe2, in which a threshold switching layer, graphdiyne oxide, instead of a dielectric blocking layer in conventional floating-gate memories, is used to connect the floating gate and control gate. The volatile threshold switching characteristic of graphdiyne oxide allows the direct charge injection from control gate to floating gate by applying a nanosecond voltage pulse (20 ns) with low magnitude (2 V), and restricts the injected charges in floating gate for a long-term retention (10 years) after the pulse. The high operation speed and low voltage endow the device with an ultralow energy consumption of 10 fJ. These results demonstrate a new strategy to develop next-generation high-speed low-energy nonvolatile memory.","Realizing fast nonvolatile floating gate memories is constrained by the slow tunnelling mechanism for charge injection. Here, Chen et al. demonstrate operation speed of 20 ns and power consumption of 10 fJ using graphdiyne oxide as a threshold switching layer instead of a dielectric blocking layer.",2022-08-06
936,Whole blood DNA methylation analysis reveals respiratory environmental traits involved in COVID-19 severity following SARS-CoV-2 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause an inflammatory syndrome (COVID-19) leading, in many cases, to bilateral pneumonia, severe dyspnea, and in ~5% of these, death. DNA methylation is known to play an important role in the regulation of the immune processes behind COVID-19 progression, however it has not been studied in depth. In this study, we aim to evaluate the implication of DNA methylation in COVID-19 progression by means of a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis combined with DNA genotyping. The results reveal the existence of epigenomic regulation of functional pathways associated with COVID-19 progression and mediated by genetic loci. We find an environmental trait-related signature that discriminates mild from severe cases and regulates, among other cytokines, IL-6 expression via the transcription factor CEBP. The analyses suggest that an interaction between environmental contribution, genetics, and epigenetics might be playing a role in triggering the cytokine storm described in the most severe cases.","Genetic associations with severe COVID-19 have been discovered, but epigenetic associations are not as well described. Here, the authors perform a genome-wide epigenetic analysis of COVID-19 patients, discovering an interaction between environmental exposure, genetics, and epigenetics which might play a role in severe disease.",2022-08-06
937,A cognitive neurogenetic approach to uncovering the structure of executive functions,"One central mission of cognitive neuroscience is to understand the ontology of complex cognitive functions. We addressed this question with a cognitive neurogenetic approach using a large-scale dataset of executive functions (EFs), whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity, and genetic polymorphisms. We found that the bifactor model with common and shifting-specific components not only was parsimonious but also showed maximal dissociations among the EF components at behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. In particular, the genes with enhanced expression in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG) showed enrichment for the common and shifting-specific component, respectively. Finally, High-dimensional mediation models further revealed that the functional connectivity patterns significantly mediated the genetic effect on the common EF component. Our study not only reveals insights into the ontology of EFs and their neurogenetic basis, but also provides useful tools to uncover the structure of complex constructs of human cognition.","How complex brain functions are mapped onto the human brain is a daunting scientific challenge. Here, the authors use a cognitive neurogenetic approach to identify the structure of executive functions and their underlying neurogenetic basis.",2022-08-06
938,Spatiotemporal dynamics of macrophage heterogeneity and a potential function of Trem2hi macrophages in infarcted hearts,"Heart failure (HF) is a frequent consequence of myocardial infarction (MI). Identification of the precise, time-dependent composition of inflammatory cells may provide clues for the establishment of new biomarkers and therapeutic approaches targeting post-MI HF. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of MI-associated immune cells in a mouse model of MI using spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We identify twelve major immune cell populations; their proportions dynamically change after MI. Macrophages are the most abundant population at all-time points (>60%), except for day 1 post-MI. Trajectory inference analysis shows upregulation of Trem2 expression in macrophages during the late phase post-MI. In vivo injection of soluble Trem2 leads to significant functional and structural improvements in infarcted hearts. Our data contribute to a better understanding of MI-driven immune responses and further investigation to determine the regulatory factors of the Trem2 signaling pathway will aid the development of novel therapeutic strategies for post-MI HF.","Cellular composition and function are not clearly defined in heart failure after myocardial infarction. Here, using single cell and spatial transcriptomics in a MI-HF mouse model, the authors show that macrophages expressing Trem2 are found within the infarcts and this could be a useful biomarker.",2022-08-06
939,Bromo- and iodo-bridged building units in metal-organic frameworks for enhanced carrier transport and CO2 photoreduction by water vapor,"Organolead halide hybrids have many promising attributes for photocatalysis, e.g. tunable bandgaps and excellent carrier transport, but their instability constraints render them vulnerable to polar molecules and limit their photocatalysis in moisture. Herein, we report the construction of metal–organic frameworks based on [Pb2X]3+ (X = Br–/I–) chains as secondary building units and 2-amino-terephthalate as organic linkers, and extend their applications in photocatalytic CO2 reduction with water vapor as the reductant. Hall effect measurement and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrate the bromo/iodo-bridged frameworks have substantially enhanced photocarrier transport, which results in photocatalytic performances superior to conventional metal-oxo metal-organic frameworks. Moreover, in contrast to lead perovskites, the [Pb2X]3+-based frameworks have accessible porosity and high moisture stability for gas-phase photocatalytic reaction between CO2 and H2O. This work significantly advances the excellent carrier transport of lead perovskites into the field of metal-organic frameworks.","Organolead halide hybrids are promising materials but are often unstable under moisture and/or light irradiation.

940,Enantioselective construction of ortho-sulfur- or nitrogen-substituted axially chiral biaryls and asymmetric synthesis of isoplagiochin D,"Axially chiral biaryl motifs possessing ortho-heteroatom-substituted functionalities exist widely in the structures of natural products and have served as foundation for constructing prominent chiral organocatalysts, ligands, functional materials, and even bioactive molecules. However, a general and enantioselective synthesis of such chiral structures with high synthetic value is rare. Taking advantage of the BaryPhos-facilitated asymmetric Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling, we have established a general, efficient and enantioselective construction of the ortho sulfur- or nitrogen-substituted axially chiral biaryls. The protocol shows excellent compatibility to various functional groups and structural features, delivering chiral biaryl structures with ortho-sulfonyl groups or with ortho-nitro groups at a broad range of molecular diversity and complexity. The immobilization of BaryPhos on polyethylene glycol (PEG) support has enabled homogeneous enantioselective cross-coupling in aqueous media and the palladium catalyst recycling for multiple times. The method has enabled a concise 10-step asymmetric synthesis of isoplagiochin D as well as the construction of chiroptical molecules with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties.","Ortho-heteroatom-substituted axially chiral biaryls are valuable structures in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Here, the authors established an efficient synthesis of these chiral structures via asymmetric cross-coupling.",2022-08-05

During mammalian pregnancy, maternal cells are transferred to the fetus. They are referred to as maternal microchimeric cells (MMc). Among other organs, MMc seed into the fetal brain, where their function is unknown. Here, we show that, in the offspring’s developing brain in mice, MMc express a unique signature of sensome markers, control microglia homeostasis and prevent excessive presynaptic elimination. Further, MMc facilitate the oscillatory entrainment of developing prefrontal-hippocampal circuits and support the maturation of behavioral abilities. Our findings highlight that MMc are not a mere placental leak out, but rather a functional mechanism that shapes optimal conditions for healthy brain function later in life.","During pregnancy, maternal cells are transferred to the fetus, where they can reach the developing brain.

942,Multi-cohort and longitudinal Bayesian clustering study of stage and subtype in Alzheimer’s disease,"Understanding Alzheimer’s disease (AD) heterogeneity is important for understanding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. However, AD atrophy subtypes may reflect different disease stages or biologically distinct subtypes. Here we use longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data (891 participants with AD dementia, 305 healthy control participants) from four international cohorts, and longitudinal clustering to estimate differential atrophy trajectories from the age of clinical disease onset. Our findings (in amyloid-β positive AD patients) show five distinct longitudinal patterns of atrophy with different demographical and cognitive characteristics. Some previously reported atrophy subtypes may reflect disease stages rather than distinct subtypes. The heterogeneity in atrophy rates and cognitive decline within the five longitudinal atrophy patterns, potentially expresses a complex combination of protective/risk factors and concomitant non-AD pathologies. By alternating between the cross-sectional and longitudinal understanding of AD subtypes these analyses may allow better understanding of disease heterogeneity.",Different types of atrophy in Alzheimer’s disease may reflect different disease stages or biologically distinct subtypes.

943,Space-time wave packets localized in all dimensions,"Optical wave packets that are localized in space and time, but nevertheless overcome diffraction and travel rigidly in free space, are a long sought-after field structure with applications ranging from microscopy and remote sensing, to nonlinear and quantum optics. However, synthesizing such wave packets requires introducing non-differentiable angular dispersion with high spectral precision in two transverse dimensions, a capability that has eluded optics to date. Here, we describe an experimental strategy capable of sculpting the spatio-temporal spectrum of a generic pulsed beam by introducing arbitrary radial chirp via two-dimensional conformal coordinate transformations of the spectrally resolved field. This procedure yields propagation-invariant ‘space-time’ wave packets localized in all dimensions, with tunable group velocity in the range from 0.7c to 1.8c in free space, and endowed with prescribed orbital angular momentum. By providing unprecedented flexibility in sculpting the three-dimensional structure of pulsed optical fields, our experimental strategy promises to be a versatile platform for the emerging enterprise of space-time optics.","Propagation-invariant wave packets confined in space and time can be useful for optical sensing, imaging, and nonlinear and quantum optics. Here the authors demonstrate control over the angular dispersion of optical wave packets in two-transverse dimensions to synthesize space-time wave packets localized in all dimensions.",2022-08-05
944,Multistep orthophosphate release tunes actomyosin energy transduction,"Muscle contraction and a range of critical cellular functions rely on force-producing interactions between myosin motors and actin filaments, powered by turnover of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The relationship between release of the ATP hydrolysis product ortophosphate (Pi) from the myosin active site and the force-generating structural change, the power-stroke, remains enigmatic despite its central role in energy transduction. Here, we present a model with multistep Pi-release that unifies current conflicting views while also revealing additional complexities of potential functional importance. The model is based on our evidence from kinetics, molecular modelling and single molecule fluorescence studies of Pi binding outside the active site. It is also consistent with high-speed atomic force microscopy movies of single myosin II molecules without Pi at the active site, showing consecutive snapshots of pre- and post-power stroke conformations. In addition to revealing critical features of energy transduction by actomyosin, the results suggest enzymatic mechanisms of potentially general relevance.","Release of the ATP hydrolysis product orthophosphate (Pi) from the myosin active site is central in force generation but is poorly understood. Here, Moretto et al. present evidence for multistep Pi-release reconciling apparently contradictory results.",2022-08-05
945,Structure of SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein essential for virus assembly,"The coronavirus membrane protein (M) is the most abundant viral structural protein and plays a central role in virus assembly and morphogenesis. However, the process of M protein-driven virus assembly are largely unknown. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein in two different conformations. M protein forms a mushroom-shaped dimer, composed of two transmembrane domain-swapped three-helix bundles and two intravirion domains. M protein further assembles into higher-order oligomers. A highly conserved hinge region is key for conformational changes. The M protein dimer is unexpectedly similar to SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, a viral ion channel. Moreover, the interaction analyses of M protein with nucleocapsid protein (N) and RNA suggest that the M protein mediates the concerted recruitment of these components through the positively charged intravirion domain. Our data shed light on the M protein-driven virus assembly mechanism and provide a structural basis for therapeutic intervention targeting M protein.","M protein plays essential roles in virus assembly and morphogenesis. Here, authors reveal two cryo-EM structures of M protein from SARS-CoV-2 that suggest conformational dynamics of M protein and its role in virus assembly.",2022-08-05
946,Biomimetic material degradation for synergistic enhanced therapy by regulating endogenous energy metabolism imaging under hypothermia,"Inefficient tumour treatment approaches often cause fatal tumour metastases. Here, we report a biomimetic multifunctional nanoplatform explicitly engineered with a Co-based metal organic framework polydopamine heterostructure (MOF-PDA), anethole trithione (ADT), and a macrophage membrane. Co-MOF degradation in the tumour microenvironment releases Co2+, which results in the downregulation of HSP90 expression and the inhibition of cellular heat resistance, thereby improving the photothermal therapy effect of PDA. H2S secretion after the enzymatic hydrolysis of ADT leads to high-concentration gas therapy. Moreover, ADT changes the balance between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/flavin adenine dinucleotide (NADH/FAD) during tumour glycolysis. ATP synthesis is limited by NADH consumption, which triggers a certain degree of tumour growth inhibition and results in starvation therapy. Potentiated 2D/3D autofluorescence imaging of NADH/FAD is also achieved in liquid nitrogen and employed to efficiently monitor tumour therapy. The developed biomimetic nanoplatform provides an approach to treat orthotopic tumours and inhibit metastasis.","Metal organic frameworks (MOF) coated with mammalian cell membranes have good biocompatibility.

947,Metabolic reprogramming from glycolysis to fatty acid uptake and beta-oxidation in platinum-resistant cancer cells,"Increased glycolysis is considered as a hallmark of cancer. Yet, cancer cell metabolic reprograming during therapeutic resistance development is under-studied. Here, through high-throughput stimulated Raman scattering imaging and single cell analysis, we find that cisplatin-resistant cells exhibit increased fatty acids (FA) uptake, accompanied by decreased glucose uptake and lipogenesis, indicating reprogramming from glucose to FA dependent anabolic and energy metabolism. A metabolic index incorporating glucose derived anabolism and FA uptake correlates linearly to the level of cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer (OC) cell lines and primary cells. The increased FA uptake facilitates cancer cell survival under cisplatin-induced oxidative stress by enhancing beta-oxidation. Consequently, blocking beta-oxidation by a small molecule inhibitor combined with cisplatin or carboplatin synergistically suppresses OC proliferation in vitro and growth of patient-derived xenografts in vivo. Collectively, these findings support a rapid detection method of cisplatin-resistance at single cell level and a strategy for treating cisplatin-resistant tumors.","Metabolic reprogramming is associated with cancer initiation, progression and resistance to therapy.

948,Detection of companion galaxies around hot dust-obscured hyper-luminous galaxy W0410-0913,"The phase transition between galaxies and quasars is often identified with the rare population of hyper-luminous, hot dust-obscured galaxies. Galaxy formation models predict these systems to grow via mergers, that can deliver large amounts of gas toward their centers, induce intense bursts of star formation and feed their supermassive black holes. Here we report the detection of 24 galaxies emitting Lyman-α emission on projected physical scales of about 400 kpc around the hyper-luminous hot dust-obscured galaxy W0410-0913, at redshift z = 3.631, using Very Large Telescope observations. While this indicates that W0410-0913 evolves in a very dense environment, we do not find clear signs of mergers that could sustain its growth. Data suggest that if mergers occurred, as models expect, these would involve less massive satellites, with only a moderate impact on the internal interstellar medium of W0410-0913, which is sustained by a rotationally-supported fast-rotating molecular disk, as Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations suggest.","Lyman-alpha emission is one of the observational probes for the high-redshift universe. Here, the authors show several Lyman-alpha emitting companion galaxies around the hot dust-obscured galaxy W0410-091 suggesting that the galaxy evolves in a very dense environment.",2022-08-05
949,Large breathing effect in ZIF-65(Zn) with expansion and contraction of the SOD cage,"The flexibility and guest-responsive behavior of some metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) indicate their potential in the fields of sensors and molecular recognition. As a subfamily of MOFs, the flexible zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) typically feature a small displacive transition due to the rigid zeolite topology. Herein, an atypical reversible displacive transition (6.4 Å) is observed for the sodalite (SOD) cage in flexible ZIF-65(Zn), which represents an unusually large breathing effect compared to other ZIFs. ZIF-65(Zn) exhibits a stepwise II → III → I expansion between an unusual ellipsoidal SOD cage (8.6 Å × 15.9 Å for II) and a spherical SOD cage (15.0 Å for I). The breathing behavior of ZIF-65(Zn) varies depending on the nature of the guest molecules (polarity and shape). Computational simulations are employed to rationalize the differences in the breathing behavior depending on the structure of the ZIF-65(Zn) cage and the nature of the guest-associated host–guest and guest–guest interactions.","Flexible metal-organic frameworks have potential applications in the development of sensors and switching materials. Here, the authors report a large breathing effect in a zeolitic imidazolate framework upon guest adsorption.",2022-08-05
950,Disease-associated mutations within the yeast DNAJB6 homolog Sis1 slow conformer-specific substrate processing and can be corrected by the modulation of nucleotide exchange factors,"Molecular chaperones, or heat shock proteins (HSPs), protect against the toxic misfolding and aggregation of proteins. As such, mutations or deficiencies within the chaperone network can lead to disease. Dominant mutations within DNAJB6 (Hsp40)—an Hsp70 co-chaperone—lead to a protein aggregation-linked myopathy termed Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type D1 (LGMDD1). Here, we used the yeast prion model client in conjunction with in vitro chaperone activity assays to gain mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of LGMDD1. Here, we show how mutations analogous to those found in LGMDD1 affect Sis1 (a functional homolog of human DNAJB6) function by altering the structure of client protein aggregates, interfering with the Hsp70 ATPase cycle, dimerization and substrate processing; poisoning the function of wild-type protein. These results uncover the mechanisms through which LGMDD1-associated mutations alter chaperone activity, and provide insights relevant to potential therapeutic interventions.",Here the authors describe mechanisms through which analogous LGMDD1 (Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type D1) mutations affect Sis1 (a yeast functional homolog of human DNAJB6) chaperone activity and poison the function of wild-type protein; potentially uncovering a new therapeutic route to explore.,2022-08-05
951,On-chip mid-infrared photothermoelectric detectors for full-Stokes detection,"On-chip polarimeters are highly desirable for the next-generation ultra-compact optical and optoelectronic systems. Polarization-sensitive photodetectors relying on anisotropic absorption of natural/artificial materials have emerged as a promising candidate for on-chip polarimeters owing to their filterless configurations. However, these photodetectors can only be applied for detection of either linearly or circularly polarized light, not applicable for full-Stokes detection. Here, we propose and demonstrate three-ports polarimeters comprising on-chip chiral plasmonic metamaterial-mediated mid-infrared photodetectors for full-Stokes detection. By manipulating the spatial distribution of chiral metamaterials, we could convert polarization-resolved absorptions to corresponding polarization-resolved photovoltages of three ports through the photothermoelectric effect. We utilize the developed polarimeter in an imaging demonstration showing reliable ability for polarization reconstruction. Our work provides an alternative strategy for developing polarization-resolved photodetectors with a bandgap-independent operation range in the mid-infrared.","Mid-infrared polarization-sensitive photodetectors are desired for several applications, such as chemical analysis and biomedical diagnosis.

952,Reactive oxygen species-responsive and Raman-traceable hydrogel combining photodynamic and immune therapy for postsurgical cancer treatment,"Combining immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy with photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds great potential in treating immunologically “cold” tumors, but photo-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) can inevitably damage co-administered ICB antibodies, hence hampering the therapeutic outcome. Here we create a ROS-responsive hydrogel to realize the sustained co-delivery of photosensitizers and ICB antibodies. During PDT, the hydrogel skeleton poly(deca-4,6-diynedioic acid) (PDDA) protects ICB antibodies by scavenging the harmful ROS, and at the same time, triggers the gradual degradation of the hydrogel to release the drugs in a controlled manner. More interestingly, we can visualize the ROS-responsive hydrogel degradation by Raman imaging, given the ultrastrong and degradation-correlative Raman signal of PDDA in the cellular silent window. A single administration of the hydrogel not only completely inhibits the long-term postoperative recurrence and metastasis of 4T1-tumor-bearing mice, but also effectively restrains the growth of re-challenged tumors. The PDDA-based ROS-responsive hydrogel herein paves a promising way for the durable synergy of PDT and ICB therapy.","Combined immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and photodynamic therapies have huge potential but suffer from possible damage of the antibodies.

953,Club cells employ regeneration mechanisms during lung tumorigenesis,"The high plasticity of lung epithelial cells, has for many years, confounded the correct identification of the cell-of-origin of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. Here, we employ lineage-tracing mouse models to investigate the cell of origin of Eml4-Alk LUAD, and show that Club and Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells give rise to tumours. We focus on Club cell originated tumours and find that Club cells experience an epigenetic switch by which they lose their lineage fidelity and gain an AT2-like phenotype after oncogenic transformation. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses identified two trajectories of Club cell evolution which are similar to the ones used during lung regeneration, suggesting that lung epithelial cells leverage on their plasticity and intrinsic regeneration mechanisms to give rise to a tumour. Together, this study highlights the role of Club cells in LUAD initiation, identifies the mechanism of Club cell lineage infidelity, confirms the presence of these features in human tumours, and unveils key mechanisms conferring LUAD heterogeneity.","Lung adenocarcinoma is a highly plastic tumour type. Here, the authors use single cell RNA sequencing to show that Club cells use regeneration mechanisms to develop tumours after an epigenetic switch towards an AT2-like phenotype shown by methylome analysis.",2022-08-05
954,Superelastic graphene aerogel-based metamaterials,"Ultralight, ultrastrong, and supertough graphene aerogel metamaterials combining with multi-functionalities are promising for future military and domestic applications. However, the unsatisfactory mechanical performances and lack of the multiscale structural regulation still impede the development of graphene aerogels. Herein, we demonstrate a laser-engraving strategy toward graphene meta-aerogels (GmAs) with unusual characters. As the prerequisite, the nanofiber-reinforced networks convert the graphene walls’ deformation from the microscopic buckling to the bulk deformation during the compression process, ensuring the highly elastic, robust, and stiff nature. Accordingly, laser-engraving enables arbitrary regulation on the macro-configurations of GmAs with rich geometries and appealing characteristics such as large stretchability of 5400% reversible elongation, ultralight specific weight as small as 0.1 mg cm−3, and ultrawide Poisson’s ratio range from −0.95 to 1.64. Additionally, incorporating specific components into the pre-designed meta-structures could further achieve diversified functionalities.",Graphene aerogels are highly porous and have very low density; despite this they also exhibit high mechanical strength.

955,Precise electrical gating of the single-molecule Mizoroki-Heck reaction,"Precise tuning of chemical reactions with predictable and controllable manners, an ultimate goal chemists desire to achieve, is valuable in the scientific community. This tunability is necessary to understand and regulate chemical transformations at both macroscopic and single-molecule levels to meet demands in potential application scenarios. Herein, we realise accurate tuning of a single-molecule Mizoroki-Heck reaction via applying gate voltages as well as complete deciphering of its detailed intrinsic mechanism by employing an in-situ electrical single-molecule detection, which possesses the capability of single-event tracking. The Mizoroki-Heck reaction can be regulated in different dimensions with a constant catalyst molecule, including the molecular orbital gating of Pd(0) catalyst, the on/off switching of the Mizoroki-Heck reaction, the promotion of its turnover frequency, and the regulation of each elementary reaction within the Mizoroki-Heck catalytic cycle. These results extend the tuning scope of chemical reactions from the macroscopic view to the single-molecule approach, inspiring new insights into designing different strategies or devices to unveil reaction mechanisms and discover novel phenomena.","Guiding chemical reactions in a predictable and controllable manner is an ultimate goal of chemistry.

956,Afadin couples RAS GTPases to the polarity rheostat Scribble,"AFDN/Afadin is required for establishment and maintenance of cell-cell contacts and is a unique effector of RAS GTPases. The biological consequences of RAS complex with AFDN are unknown. We used proximity-based proteomics to generate an interaction map for two isoforms of AFDN, identifying the polarity protein SCRIB/Scribble as the top hit. We reveal that the first PDZ domain of SCRIB and the AFDN FHA domain mediate a direct but non-canonical interaction between these important adhesion and polarity proteins. Further, the dual RA domains of AFDN have broad specificity for RAS and RAP GTPases, and KRAS co-localizes with AFDN and promotes AFDN-SCRIB complex formation. Knockout of AFDN or SCRIB in epithelial cells disrupts MAPK and PI3K activation kinetics and inhibits motility in a growth factor-dependent manner. These data have important implications for understanding why cells with activated RAS have reduced cell contacts and polarity defects and implicate AFDN as a genuine RAS effector.","Goudreault et al. investigate the role of Afadin downstream of RAS GTPases, substantiating this cell adhesion protein as a true RAS effector that couples its activation to cell polarity through the Scribble protein.",2022-08-05
957,Tuning crystal-phase of bimetallic single-nanoparticle for catalytic hydrogenation,"Bimetallic nanoparticles afford geometric variation and electron redistribution via strong metal-metal interactions that substantially promote the activity and selectivity in catalysis. Quantitatively describing the atomic configuration of the catalytically active sites, however, is experimentally challenged by the averaging ensemble effect that is caused by the interplay between particle size and crystal-phase at elevated temperatures and under reactive gases. Here, we report that the intrinsic activity of the body-centered cubic PdCu nanoparticle, for acetylene hydrogenation, is one order of magnitude greater than that of the face-centered cubic one. This finding is based on precisely identifying the atomic structures of the active sites over the same-sized but crystal-phase-varied single-particles. The densely-populated Pd-Cu bond on the chemically ordered nanoparticle possesses isolated Pd site with a lower coordination number and a high-lying valence d-band center, and thus greatly expedites the dissociation of H2 over Pd atom and efficiently accommodates the activated H atoms on the particle top/subsurfaces.",Quantitatively describing the atomic configuration of the catalytically active sites is challenging.

958,Fractional neural sampling as a theory of spatiotemporal probabilistic computations in neural circuits,"A range of perceptual and cognitive processes have been characterized from the perspective of probabilistic representations and inference. To understand the neural circuit mechanism underlying these probabilistic computations, we develop a theory based on complex spatiotemporal dynamics of neural population activity. We first implement and explore this theory in a biophysically realistic, spiking neural circuit. Population activity patterns emerging from the circuit capture realistic variability or fluctuations of neural dynamics both in time and in space. These activity patterns implement a type of probabilistic computations that we name fractional neural sampling (FNS). We further develop a mathematical model to reveal the algorithmic nature of FNS and its computational advantages for representing multimodal distributions, a major challenge faced by existing theories. We demonstrate that FNS provides a unified account of a diversity of experimental observations of neural spatiotemporal dynamics and perceptual processes such as visual perception inference, and that FNS makes experimentally testable predictions.","Dynamics of neural circuits mapping brain functions such as sensory processing and decision making, can be characterized by probabilistic representations and inference.

959,Ultra-compact MXene fibers by continuous and controllable synergy of interfacial interactions and thermal drawing-induced stresses,"Recent advances in MXene (Ti3C2Tx) fibers, prepared from electrically conductive and mechanically strong MXene nanosheets, address the increasing demand of emerging yet promising electrode materials for the development of textile-based devices and beyond. However, to reveal the full potential of MXene fibers, reaching a balance between electrical conductivity and mechanical property is still the fundamental challenge, mainly due to the difficulties to further compact the loose MXene nanosheets. In this work, we demonstrate a continuous and controllable route to fabricate ultra-compact MXene fibers with an in-situ generated protective layer via the synergy of interfacial interactions and thermal drawing-induced stresses. The resulting ultra-compact MXene fibers with high orientation and low porosity exhibit not only excellent tensile strength and ultra-high toughness, but also high electrical conductivity. Then, we construct meter-scale MXene textiles using these ultra-compact fibers to achieve high-performance electromagnetic interference shielding and personal thermal management, accompanied by the high mechanical durability and stability even after multiple washing cycles. The demonstrated generic strategy can be applied to a broad range of nanostructured materials to construct functional fibers for large-scale applications in both space and daily lives.","Forming compact layered nanostructures is key to achieving continuous MXene fibers with electrical and mechanical properties.

960,Regulatory mechanisms of lipopolysaccharide synthesis in Escherichia coli,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an essential glycolipid and forms a protective permeability barrier for most Gram-negative bacteria. In E. coli, LPS levels are under feedback control, achieved by FtsH-mediated degradation of LpxC, which catalyzes the first committed step in LPS synthesis. FtsH is a membrane-bound AAA+ protease, and its protease activity toward LpxC is regulated by essential membrane proteins LapB and YejM. However, the regulatory mechanisms are elusive. We establish an in vitro assay to analyze the kinetics of LpxC degradation and demonstrate that LapB is an adaptor protein that utilizes its transmembrane helix to interact with FtsH and its cytoplasmic domains to recruit LpxC. Our YejM/LapB complex structure reveals that YejM is an anti-adaptor protein, competing with FtsH for LapB to inhibit LpxC degradation. Structural analysis unravels that LapB and LPS have overlapping binding sites in YejM. Thus, LPS levels control formation of the YejM/LapB complex to determine LpxC protein levels.","Synthesis of lipopolysaccharides, essential components for most gram-negative bacteria, is under tight control. Here, authors use in vitro reconstitution and structural approaches to elucidate some of these regulatory mechanisms involving essential membrane proteins LapB and YejM.",2022-08-05
961,"Intrinsically fluorescent polyureas toward conformation-assisted metamorphosis, discoloration and intracellular drug delivery","Peptidomimetic polymers have attracted increasing interest because of the advantages of facile synthesis, high molecular tunability, resistance to degradation, and low immunogenicity. However, the presence of non-native linkages compromises their ability to form higher ordered structures and protein-inspired functions. Here we report a class of amino acid-constructed polyureas with molecular weight- and solvent-dependent helical and sheet-like conformations as well as green fluorescent protein-mimic autofluorescence with aggregation-induced emission characteristics. The copolymers self-assemble into vesicles and nanotubes and exhibit H-bonding-mediated metamorphosis and discoloration behaviors. We show that these polymeric vehicles with ultrahigh stability, superfast responsivity and conformation-assisted cell internalization efficiency could act as an “on-off” switchable nanocarrier for specific intracellular drug delivery and effective cancer theranosis in vitro and in vivo. This work provides insights into the folding and hierarchical assembly of biomacromolecules, and a new generation of bioresponsive polymers and nonconventional luminescent aliphatic materials for diverse applications.","Biomimetic materials are of interest but can often suffer from limitations caused by the non-native linkages used.

Maintaining this orderness and meanwhile endowing the nanomaterials with highly precise and free-designed 3D micro architectures will open an exciting prospect for various novel applications. In this paper, we developed a sacrificial-scaffold-mediated two-photon lithography (TPL) strategy that enables the fabrication of complex 3D colloidal crystal microstructures with orderly-arranged nanoparticles inside. We show that, with the help of a degradable hydrogel scaffold, the disturbance effect of the femtosecond laser to the nanoparticle self-assembling could be overcome. Therefore, hydrogel-state and solid-state colloidal crystal microstructures with diverse compositions, free-designed geometries and variable structural colors could be easily fabricated. This enables the possibility to create novel colloidal crystal microsensing systems that have not been achieved before.","Colloidal crystals are widely applied in the fabrication of optoelectronic devices, but realizing freedom of design, such as in 3D printing, in colloidal crystal fabrication remains challenging.

963,Selective skeletal editing of polycyclic arenes using organophotoredox dearomative functionalization,"Reactions that lead to destruction of aromatic ring systems often require harsh conditions and, thus, take place with poor selectivities. Selective partial dearomatization of fused arenes is even more challenging but can be a strategic approach to creating versatile, complex polycyclic frameworks. Herein we describe a general organophotoredox approach for the chemo- and regioselective dearomatization of structurally diverse polycyclic aromatics, including quinolines, isoquinolines, quinoxalines, naphthalenes, anthracenes and phenanthrenes. The success of the method for chemoselective oxidative rupture of aromatic moieties relies on precise manipulation of the electronic nature of the fused polycyclic arenes. Mechanistic studies show that the addition of a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) agent helps favor the dearomatization pathway over the more thermodynamically downhill aromatization pathway. We show that this strategy can be applied to rapid synthesis of biologically valued targets and late-stage skeletal remodeling en route to complex structures.",The synthesis of polycyclic structures bearing partially saturated (hetero)arenes is important as many of these structures have biological relevance. Here the authors develop a one-step method for selective dearomative functionalization of feedstock (hetero)arenes via organophotocatalysis.,2022-08-05
964,The role of solid solutions in iron phosphate-based electrodes for selective electrochemical lithium extraction,"Electrochemical intercalation can enable lithium extraction from dilute water sources. However, during extraction, co-intercalation of lithium and sodium ions occurs, and the response of host materials to this process is not fully understood. This aspect limits the rational materials designs for improving lithium extraction. Here, to address this knowledge gap, we report one-dimensional (1D) olivine iron phosphate (FePO4) as a model host to investigate the co-intercalation behavior and demonstrate the control of lithium selectivity through intercalation kinetic manipulations. Via computational and experimental investigations, we show that lithium and sodium tend to phase separate in the host. Exploiting this mechanism, we increase the sodium-ion intercalation energy barrier by using partially filled 1D lithium channels via non-equilibrium solid-solution lithium seeding or remnant lithium in the solid-solution phases. The lithium selectivity enhancement after seeding shows a strong correlation with the fractions of solid-solution phases with high lithium content (i.e., LixFePO4 with 0.5 ≤ x < 1). Finally, we also demonstrate that the solid-solution formation pathway depends on the host material’s particle morphology, size and defect content.","Lithium extraction from dilute sources could help solve the lithium supply security issue.

965,Serine metabolism remodeling after platinum-based chemotherapy identifies vulnerabilities in a subgroup of resistant ovarian cancers,"Resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy represents a major clinical challenge for many tumors, including epithelial ovarian cancer. Patients often experience several response-relapse events, until tumors become resistant and life expectancy drops to 12–15 months. Despite improved knowledge of the molecular determinants of platinum resistance, the lack of clinical applicability limits exploitation of many potential targets, leaving patients with limited options. Serine biosynthesis has been linked to cancer growth and poor prognosis in various cancer types, however its role in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is not known. Here, we show that a subgroup of resistant tumors decreases phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) expression at relapse after platinum-based chemotherapy. Mechanistically, we observe that this phenomenon is accompanied by a specific oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) regenerating phenotype, which helps tumor cells in sustaining Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity under platinum treatment. Our findings reveal metabolic vulnerabilities with clinical implications for a subset of platinum resistant ovarian cancers.","Metabolic reprogramming is associated with cancer development and therapy resistance. Here, the authors show that downregulation of the serine biosynthesis enzyme PHGDH in a fraction of patients is associated with relapse in platinum-treated ovarian cancers and to NAD+ and PARP activity upregulation.",2022-08-05
966,Recursive Editing improves homology-directed repair through retargeting of undesired outcomes,"CRISPR-Cas induced homology-directed repair (HDR) enables the installation of a broad range of precise genomic modifications from an exogenous donor template. However, applications of HDR in human cells are often hampered by poor efficiency, stemming from a preference for error-prone end joining pathways that yield short insertions and deletions. Here, we describe Recursive Editing, an HDR improvement strategy that selectively retargets undesired indel outcomes to create additional opportunities to produce the desired HDR allele. We introduce a software tool, named REtarget, that enables the rational design of Recursive Editing experiments. Using REtarget-designed guide RNAs in single editing reactions, Recursive Editing can simultaneously boost HDR efficiencies and reduce undesired indels. We also harness REtarget to generate databases for particularly effective Recursive Editing sites across the genome, to endogenously tag proteins, and to target pathogenic mutations. Recursive Editing constitutes an easy-to-use approach without potentially deleterious cell manipulations and little added experimental burden.","CRISPR-Cas induced HDR methods tend to have a low efficiency.

967,Multifunctional synthetic nano-chaperone for peptide folding and intracellular delivery,"Artificial, synthetic chaperones have attracted much attention in biomedical research due to their ability to control the folding of proteins and peptides. Here, we report bio-inspired multifunctional porous nanoparticles to modulate proper folding and intracellular delivery of therapeutic α-helical peptide. The Synthetic Nano-Chaperone for Peptide (SNCP) based on porous nanoparticles provides an internal hydrophobic environment which contributes in stabilizing secondary structure of encapsulated α-helical peptides due to the hydrophobic internal environments. In addition, SNCP with optimized inner surface modification not only improves thermal stability for α-helical peptide but also supports the peptide stapling methods in situ, serving as a nanoreactor. Then, SNCP subsequently delivers the stabilized therapeutic α-helical peptides into cancer cells, resulting in high therapeutic efficacy. SNCP improves cellular uptake and bioavailability of the anti-cancer peptide, so the cancer growth is effectively inhibited in vivo. These data indicate that the bio-inspired SNCP system combining nanoreactor and delivery carrier could provide a strategy to expedite the development of peptide therapeutics by overcoming existing drawbacks of α-helical peptides as drug candidates.","Molecular chaperones play an important part in protein folding and delivery in nature.

968,Mettl3-mediated mRNA m6A modification controls postnatal liver development by modulating the transcription factor Hnf4a,"Hepatic specification and functional maturation are tightly controlled throughout development. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification of eukaryotic mRNAs and is involved in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the function of m6A in liver development remains elusive. Here we dissect the role of Mettl3-mediated m6A modification in postnatal liver development and homeostasis. Knocking out Mettl3 perinatally with Alb-Cre (Mettl3 cKO) induces apoptosis and steatosis of hepatocytes, results in severe liver injury, and finally leads to postnatal lethality within 7 weeks. m6A-RIP sequencing and RNA-sequencing reveal that mRNAs of a series of crucial liver-enriched transcription factors are modified by m6A, including Hnf4a, a master regulator for hepatic parenchymal formation. Deleting Mettl3 reduces m6A modification on Hnf4a, decreases its transcript stability in an Igf2bp1-dependent manner, and down-regulates Hnf4a expression, while overexpressing Hnf4a with AAV8 alleviates the liver injury and prolongs the lifespan of Mettl3 cKO mice. However, knocking out Mettl3 in adults using Alb-CreERT2 does not affect liver homeostasis. Our study identifies a dynamic role of Mettl3-mediated RNA m6A modification in liver development.",m6A is the most abundant RNA modification of eukaryotic mRNAs and is involved in various physiological and pathological processes.

969,A comprehensive thermodynamic model for RNA binding by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pumilio protein PUF4,"Genomic methods have been valuable for identifying RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and the genes, pathways, and processes they regulate. Nevertheless, standard motif descriptions cannot be used to predict all RNA targets or test quantitative models for cellular interactions and regulation. We present a complete thermodynamic model for RNA binding to the S. cerevisiae Pumilio protein PUF4 derived from direct binding data for 6180 RNAs measured using the RNA on a massively parallel array (RNA-MaP) platform. The PUF4 model is highly similar to that of the related RBPs, human PUM2 and PUM1, with one marked exception: a single favorable site of base flipping for PUF4, such that PUF4 preferentially binds to a non-contiguous series of residues. These results are foundational for developing and testing cellular models of RNA-RBP interactions and function, for engineering RBPs, for understanding the biophysical nature of RBP binding and the evolutionary landscape of RNAs and RBPs.","Traditional genomic methods identify RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and the genes they regulate, but do not provide predictive models.

970,Minimally invasive detection of cancer using metabolic changes in tumor-associated natural killer cells with Oncoimmune probes,"Natural Killer (NK) cells, a subset of innate immune cells, undergo cancer-specific changes during tumor progression. Therefore, tracking NK cell activity in circulation has potential for cancer diagnosis. Identification of tumor associated NK cells remains a challenge as most of the cancer antigens are unknown. Here, we introduce tumor-associated circulating NK cell profiling (CNKP) as a stand-alone cancer diagnostic modality with a liquid biopsy. Metabolic profiles of NK cell activation as a result of tumor interaction are detected with a SERS functionalized OncoImmune probe platform. We show that the cancer stem cell-associated NK cell is of value in cancer diagnosis. Through machine learning, the features of NK cell activity in patient blood could identify cancer from non-cancer using 5uL of peripheral blood with 100% accuracy and localization of cancer with 93% accuracy. These results show the feasibility of minimally invasive cancer diagnostics using circulating NK cells.",NK cells can be affected by tumour cells and this difference could be utilised as a cancer diagnostic.

971,Climate windows of opportunity for plant expansion during the Phanerozoic,"Earth’s long-term climate may have profoundly influenced plant evolution. Local climatic factors, including water availability, light, and temperature, play a key role in plant physiology and growth, and have fluctuated substantially over geological time. However, the impact of these key climate variables on global plant biomass across the Phanerozoic has not yet been established. Linking climate and dynamic vegetation modelling, we identify two key ‘windows of opportunity’ during the Ordovician and Jurassic-Paleogene capable of supporting dramatic expansions of potential plant biomass. These conditions are driven by continental dispersion, paleolatitude of continental area and a lack of glaciation, allowing for an intense hydrological cycle and greater water availability. These windows coincide with the initial expansion of land plants and the later angiosperm radiation. Our findings suggest that the timing and expansion of habitable space for plants played an important role in plant evolution and diversification.","Climatic variables have played a significant role in plant evolution across the Phanerozoic. Here, the authors link climate with a new dynamic vegetation model to identify two windows of opportunity for plant biomass expansion, corresponding with the expansion of land plants and the angiosperm radiation.",2022-08-04
972,An electronic nematic liquid in BaNi2As2,"Understanding the organizing principles of interacting electrons and the emergence of novel electronic phases is a central endeavor of condensed matter physics. Electronic nematicity, in which the discrete rotational symmetry in the electron fluid is broken while the translational one remains unaffected, is a prominent example of such a phase. It has proven ubiquitous in correlated electron systems, and is of prime importance to understand Fe-based superconductors. Here, we find that fluctuations of such broken symmetry are exceptionally strong over an extended temperature range above phase transitions in \({{{{{\rm{Ba}}}}}}{{{{{{\rm{Ni}}}}}}}_{2}{({{{{{{\rm{As}}}}}}}_{1-x}{{{{{{\rm{P}}}}}}}_{x})}_{2}\), the nickel homologue to the Fe-based systems. This lends support to a type of electronic nematicity, dynamical in nature, which exhibits a particularly strong coupling to the underlying crystal lattice. Fluctuations between degenerate nematic configurations cause splitting of phonon lines, without lifting degeneracies nor breaking symmetries, akin to spin liquids in magnetic systems.","Electronic nematicity is typically associated with the breaking of rotational symmetry. Here the authors report unusual nematicity in BaNi2As2, manifested in a large splitting of the optical phonon mode above the structural transition temperature, and link it to the coupling between the lattice and nematic fluctuations.",2022-08-04

Here we compare homotypic and heterotypic humoral and cellular immune responses to Omicron BA.1 in organ transplant patients across a diverse clinical spectrum. We perform variant-specific pseudovirus neutralization assays for D614G, and Omicron-BA.1, -BA.2, and Delta variants. We also measure poly-and monofunctional T-cell responses to BA.1 and ancestral SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools. We identify that partially or fully-vaccinated transplant recipients after infection with Omicron BA.1 have the greatest BA.1 neutralizing antibody and BA.1-specific polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, with potent cross-neutralization against BA.2. In these patients, the magnitude of the BA.1-directed response is comparable to immunocompetent triple-vaccinated controls. A subset of patients with pre-Omicron infection have heterotypic responses to BA.1 and BA.2, whereas uninfected transplant patients with three doses of vaccine demonstrate the weakest comparative responses. These results have implications for risk of infection, re-infection, and disease severity among immune compromised hosts with Omicron infection.","Immunocompromised individuals are predisposed to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, with transplant recipients typically displaying impaired immune response to pathogens, due to typical life-long immunosuppressive treatment. In this work, the authors evaluate the immune response to Omicron subvariants BA.1 and BA.2 in organ transplant recipients across a diverse clinical spectrum.",2022-08-04
974,Structural and mechanistic analysis of a tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic TRAP transporter,"Tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters are found widely in bacteria and archaea and consist of three structural domains, a soluble substrate-binding protein (P-domain), and two transmembrane domains (Q- and M-domains). HiSiaPQM and its homologs are TRAP transporters for sialic acid and are essential for host colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Here, we reconstitute HiSiaQM into lipid nanodiscs and use cryo-EM to reveal the structure of a TRAP transporter. It is composed of 16 transmembrane helices that are unexpectedly structurally related to multimeric elevator-type transporters. The idiosyncratic Q-domain of TRAP transporters enables the formation of a monomeric elevator architecture. A model of the tripartite PQM complex is experimentally validated and reveals the coupling of the substrate-binding protein to the transporter domains. We use single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in solid-supported lipid bilayers and surface plasmon resonance to study the formation of the tripartite complex and to investigate the impact of interface mutants. Furthermore, we characterize high-affinity single variable domains on heavy chain (VHH) antibodies that bind to the periplasmic side of HiSiaQM and inhibit sialic acid uptake, providing insight into how TRAP transporter function might be inhibited in vivo.","Tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters are widespread in bacteria and archaea. Here, the authors used cryo-EM and a range of biophysical techniques to study the structure of function of the sialic acid TRAP transporter HiSiaQM.",2022-08-04
975,Ultra-low-power second-order nonlinear optics on a chip,"Second-order nonlinear optical processes convert light from one wavelength to another and generate quantum entanglement. Creating chip-scale devices to efficiently control these interactions greatly increases the reach of photonics. Existing silicon-based photonic circuits utilize the third-order optical nonlinearity, but an analogous integrated platform for second-order nonlinear optics remains an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate efficient frequency doubling and parametric oscillation with a threshold of tens of micro-watts in an integrated thin-film lithium niobate photonic circuit. We achieve degenerate and non-degenerate operation of the parametric oscillator at room temperature and tune its emission over one terahertz by varying the pump frequency by hundreds of megahertz. Finally, we observe cascaded second-order processes that result in parametric oscillation. These resonant second-order nonlinear circuits will form a crucial part of the emerging nonlinear and quantum photonics platforms.","Here, the authors demonstrate a chip-scale device that realizes a comprehensive set of resonant second order nonlinear processes including optical parametric oscillation with a threshold power of 70 microwatts.",2022-08-04
976,Cancer immune therapy using engineered ‛tail-flipping’ nanoliposomes targeting alternatively activated macrophages,"Alternatively-activated, M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) strongly contribute to tumor growth, invasiveness and metastasis. Technologies to disable the pro-tumorigenic function of these TAMs are of high interest to immunotherapy research. Here we show that by designing engineered nanoliposomes bio-mimicking peroxidated phospholipids that are recognised and internalised by scavenger receptors, TAMs can be targeted. Incorporation of phospholipids possessing a terminal carboxylate group at the sn-2 position into nanoliposome bilayers drives their uptake by M2 macrophages with high specificity. Molecular dynamics simulation of the lipid bilayer predicts flipping of the sn-2 tail towards the aqueous phase, while molecular docking data indicates interaction of the tail with Scavenger Receptor Class B type 1 (SR-B1). In vivo, the engineered nanoliposomes are distributed specifically to M2-like macrophages and, upon delivery of the STAT6 inhibitor (AS1517499), zoledronic acid or muramyl tripeptide, these cells promote reduction of the premetastatic niche and/or tumor growth. Altogether, we demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our engineered “tail-flipping” nanoliposomes in a pre-clinical model, which paves the way to their development as cancer immunotherapeutics in humans.","Tumor-associated macrophages are mostly pro-tumorigenic, due to their re-programming by the tumor microenvironment. Here authors show that nanoliposomes, incorporating phospholipids with a flipping-tail chain, are engulfed specifically by intratumoral, alternatively activated macrophages, while delivering a cargo that converts these cells into anti-tumor macrophages.",2022-08-04
977,Synaptotagmin-13 orchestrates pancreatic endocrine cell egression and islet morphogenesis,"During pancreas development endocrine cells leave the ductal epithelium to form the islets of Langerhans, but the morphogenetic mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we identify the Ca2+-independent atypical Synaptotagmin-13 (Syt13) as a key regulator of endocrine cell egression and islet formation. We detect specific upregulation of the Syt13 gene and encoded protein in endocrine precursors and the respective lineage during islet formation. The Syt13 protein is localized to the apical membrane of endocrine precursors and to the front domain of egressing endocrine cells, marking a previously unidentified apical-basal to front-rear repolarization during endocrine precursor cell egression. Knockout of Syt13 impairs endocrine cell egression and skews the α-to-β-cell ratio. Mechanistically, Syt13 is a vesicle trafficking protein, transported via the microtubule cytoskeleton, and interacts with phosphatidylinositol phospholipids for polarized localization. By internalizing a subset of plasma membrane proteins at the front domain, including α6β4 integrins, Syt13 modulates cell-matrix adhesion and allows efficient endocrine cell egression. Altogether, these findings uncover an unexpected role for Syt13 as a morphogenetic driver of endocrinogenesis and islet formation.",How pancreatic islets of Langerhans are built during development is incompletely understood. Here the authors find that Synaptotagmin-13 mediates remodeling of cell-matrix adhesion to regulate endocrine cell egression and islet morphogenesis.,2022-08-04
978,TP53-dependent toxicity of CRISPR/Cas9 cuts is differential across genomic loci and can confound genetic screening,"CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can inactivate genes in a precise manner. This process involves DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), which may incur a loss of cell fitness. We hypothesize that DSB toxicity may be variable depending on the chromatin environment in the targeted locus. Here, by analyzing isogenic cell line pair CRISPR experiments jointly with previous screening data from across ~900 cell lines, we show that TP53-associated break toxicity is higher in genomic regions that harbor active chromatin, such as gene regulatory elements or transcription elongation histone marks. DSB repair pathway choice and DNA sequence context also associate with toxicity. We also show that, due to noise introduced by differential toxicity of sgRNA-targeted sites, the power of genetic screens to detect conditional essentiality is reduced in TP53 wild-type cells. Understanding the determinants of Cas9 cut toxicity will help improve design of CRISPR reagents to avoid incidental selection of TP53-deficient and/or DNA repair deficient cells.","Toxicity of CRISPR/Cas9 induced DNA breaks depends on their repair mechanism, and on the chromatin environment at the cut site. Here the authors show that edits in active genes or regulatory elements can incur a higher toxicity via a TP53-dependent mechanism.",2022-08-04
979,Coherent full polarization control based on bound states in the continuum,"Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are resonant modes of open structures that do not suffer damping, despite being compatible with radiation in terms of their momentum. They have been raising significant attention for their intriguing topological features, and their opportunities in photonics to enhance light-matter interactions. In parallel, the coherent excitation of optical devices through the tailored interference of multiple beams has been explored as a way to enhance the degree of real-time control over their response. Here, we leverage the combination of these phenomena, and exploit the topological features of BICs in the presence of multiple input beams to enable full polarization control on the entire Poincaré sphere in a photonic crystal slab only supporting a symmetry-protected BIC, experimentally demonstrating highly efficient polarization conversion controlled in real time through the superposition of coherent excitations. Our findings open exciting opportunities for a variety of photonic and quantum optics applications, benefitting from extreme wave interactions and topological features around BICs combined with optical control through coherent interference of multiple excitations.","Polarization control is of paramount importance for various applications. Here, the authors enable extreme control over light polarization spanning the entire Poincaré sphere by combining coherent control of wave phenomena and the physics of bound states in the continuum.",2022-08-04
980,The molecular mechanism of snake short-chain α-neurotoxin binding to muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,"Bites by elapid snakes (e.g. cobras) can result in life-threatening paralysis caused by venom neurotoxins blocking neuromuscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Here, we determine the cryo-EM structure of the muscle-type Torpedo receptor in complex with ScNtx, a recombinant short-chain α-neurotoxin. ScNtx is pinched between loop C on the principal subunit and a unique hairpin in loop F on the complementary subunit, thereby blocking access to the neurotransmitter binding site. ScNtx adopts a binding mode that is tilted toward the complementary subunit, forming a wider network of interactions than those seen in the long-chain α-Bungarotoxin complex. Certain mutations in ScNtx at the toxin-receptor interface eliminate inhibition of neuronal α7 nAChRs, but not of human muscle-type receptors. These observations explain why ScNtx binds more tightly to muscle-type receptors than neuronal receptors. Together, these data offer a framework for understanding subtype-specific actions of short-chain α-neurotoxins and inspire strategies for design of new snake antivenoms.","Bites by elapid snakes can result in life-threatening paralysis caused by α-neurotoxins blocking the neuromuscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Here, the authors determine the cryo-EM structure of this receptor in complex with a short-chain α-neurotoxin.",2022-08-04
981,Ultrahigh resistance of hexagonal boron nitride to mineral scale formation,"Formation of mineral scale on a material surface has profound impact on a wide range of natural processes as well as industrial applications. However, how specific material surface characteristics affect the mineral-surface interactions and subsequent mineral scale formation is not well understood. Here we report the superior resistance of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to mineral scale formation compared to not only common metal and polymer surfaces but also the highly scaling-resistant graphene, making hBN possibly the most scaling resistant material reported to date. Experimental and simulation results reveal that this ultrahigh scaling-resistance is attributed to the combination of hBN’s atomically-smooth surface, in-plane atomic energy corrugation due to the polar boron-nitrogen bond, and the close match between its interatomic spacing and the size of water molecules. The latter two properties lead to strong polar interactions with water and hence the formation of a dense hydration layer, which strongly hinders the approach of mineral ions and crystals, decreasing both surface heterogeneous nucleation and crystal attachment.",Scale formation may have detrimental effects on the properties and functions of materials’ surfaces. Here the authors report the high scaling resistance of hexagonal boron nitride and relate it to the atomic level structure and interaction with water molecules.,2022-08-04
982,Nesting of multiple polyhedral plasmonic nanoframes into a single entity,"The development of plasmonic nanostructures with intricate nanoframe morphologies has attracted considerable interest for improving catalytic and optical properties. However, arranging multiple nanoframes in one nanostructure especially, in a solution phase remains a great challenge. Herein, we show complex nanoparticles by embedding various shapes of three-dimensional polyhedral nanoframes within a single entity through rationally designed synthetic pathways. This synthetic strategy is based on the selective deposition of platinum atoms on high surface energy facets and subsequent growth into solid platonic nanoparticles, followed by the etching of inner Au domains, leaving complex nanoframes. Our synthetic routes are rationally designed and executable on-demand with a high structural controllability. Diverse Au solid nanostructures (octahedra, truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, and cubes) evolved into complex multi-layered nanoframes with different numbers/shapes/sizes of internal nanoframes. After coating the surface of the nanoframes with plasmonically active metal (like Ag), the materials exhibited highly enhanced electromagnetic near-field focusing embedded within the internal complicated rim architecture.","The spatial configuration of nanostructure building blocks determines the physical and optical properties of their superstructures. Here, the authors report on complex nanoparticles in which different geometric forms of nanoframes are nested into a single entity by multistep chemical reactions.",2022-08-04
983,Molecular characterization of colorectal cancer related peritoneal metastatic disease,"A significant proportion of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop peritoneal metastases (PM) in the course of their disease. PMs are associated with a poor quality of life, significant morbidity and dismal disease outcome. To improve care for this patient group, a better understanding of the molecular characteristics of CRC-PM is required. Here we present a comprehensive molecular characterization of a cohort of 52 patients. This reveals that CRC-PM represent a distinct CRC molecular subtype, CMS4, but can be further divided in three separate categories, each presenting with unique features. We uncover that the CMS4-associated structural protein Moesin plays a key role in peritoneal dissemination. Finally, we define specific evolutionary features of CRC-PM which indicate that polyclonal metastatic seeding underlies these lesions. Together our results suggest that CRC-PM should be perceived as a distinct disease entity.","Colorectal cancer can lead to the development of peritoneal metastases, which are associated with worse disease outcome. Here, the authors characterize peritoneal metastases from 52 patients using RNA-seq and mutational sequencing and show a distinct molecular subtype.",2022-08-04
984,Interaction between transcribing RNA polymerase and topoisomerase I prevents R-loop formation in E. coli,"Bacterial topoisomerase I (TopoI) removes excessive negative supercoiling and is thought to relax DNA molecules during transcription, replication and other processes. Using ChIP-Seq, we show that TopoI of Escherichia coli (EcTopoI) is colocalized, genome-wide, with transcribing RNA polymerase (RNAP). Treatment with transcription elongation inhibitor rifampicin leads to EcTopoI relocation to promoter regions, where RNAP also accumulates. When a 14 kDa RNAP-binding EcTopoI C-terminal domain (CTD) is overexpressed, colocalization of EcTopoI and RNAP along the transcription units is reduced. Pull-down experiments directly show that the two enzymes interact in vivo. Using ChIP-Seq and Topo-Seq, we demonstrate that EcTopoI is enriched upstream (within up to 12-15 kb) of highly-active transcription units, indicating that EcTopoI relaxes negative supercoiling generated by transcription. Uncoupling of the RNAP:EcTopoI interaction by either overexpression of EcTopoI competitor (CTD or inactive EcTopoI Y319F mutant) or deletion of EcTopoI domains involved in the interaction is toxic for cells and leads to excessive negative plasmid supercoiling. Moreover, uncoupling of the RNAP:EcTopoI interaction leads to R-loops accumulation genome-wide, indicating that this interaction is required for prevention of R-loops formation.","In E. coli, disruption of TopoI and RNAP interaction decreases cells viability and leads to hypernegative DNA supercoiling and R loops accumulation. TopoI and DNA gyrase bind around transcription units and TopoI recognizes cleavage sites by a specific motif and negative supercoiling.",2022-08-04
985,Pan-African genome demonstrates how population-specific genome graphs improve high-throughput sequencing data analysis,"Graph-based genome reference representations have seen significant development, motivated by the inadequacy of the current human genome reference to represent the diverse genetic information from different human populations and its inability to maintain the same level of accuracy for non-European ancestries. While there have been many efforts to develop computationally efficient graph-based toolkits for NGS read alignment and variant calling, methods to curate genomic variants and subsequently construct genome graphs remain an understudied problem that inevitably determines the effectiveness of the overall bioinformatics pipeline. In this study, we discuss obstacles encountered during graph construction and propose methods for sample selection based on population diversity, graph augmentation with structural variants and resolution of graph reference ambiguity caused by information overload. Moreover, we present the case for iteratively augmenting tailored genome graphs for targeted populations and demonstrate this approach on the whole-genome samples of African ancestry. Our results show that population-specific graphs, as more representative alternatives to linear or generic graph references, can achieve significantly lower read mapping errors and enhanced variant calling sensitivity, in addition to providing the improvements of joint variant calling without the need of computationally intensive post-processing steps.","Graph-based genome reference representations have seen significant development, motivated by the inadequacy of the current human genome reference to represent the diverse genetic information from different human populations and its inability to maintain the same level of accuracy for non-European ancestries.

986,Generating experimentally unrelated target molecule-binding highly functionalized nucleic-acid polymers using machine learning,"In vitro selection queries large combinatorial libraries for sequence-defined polymers with target binding and reaction catalysis activity. While the total sequence space of these libraries can extend beyond 1022 sequences, practical considerations limit starting sequences to ≤~1015 distinct molecules. Selection-induced sequence convergence and limited sequencing depth further constrain experimentally observable sequence space. To address these limitations, we integrate experimental and machine learning approaches to explore regions of sequence space unrelated to experimentally derived variants. We perform in vitro selections to discover highly side-chain-functionalized nucleic acid polymers (HFNAPs) with potent affinities for a target small molecule (daunomycin KD = 5–65 nM). We then use the selection data to train a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) machine learning model to generate diverse and unique HFNAP sequences with high daunomycin affinities (KD = 9–26 nM), even though they are unrelated in sequence to experimental polymers. Coupling in vitro selection with a machine learning model thus enables direct generation of active variants, demonstrating a new approach to the discovery of functional biopolymers.","In vitro library screening is a powerful approach to identify functional biopolymers, but only covers a fraction of possible sequences. Here, the authors use experimental in vitro selection results to train a conditional variational autoencoder machine learning model that generates biopolymers with no apparent sequence similarity to experimentally derived examples, but that nevertheless bind the target molecule with similar potent binding affinity.",2022-08-04
987,Maturation and substrate processing topography of the Plasmodium falciparum invasion/egress protease plasmepsin X,"The malaria parasite Plasmodium invades a host erythrocyte, multiplies within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and then ruptures the PV and erythrocyte membranes in a process known as egress. Both egress and invasion are controlled by effector proteins discharged from specialized secretory organelles. The aspartic protease plasmepsin X (PM X) regulates activity for many of these effectors, but it is unclear how PM X accesses its diverse substrates that reside in different organelles. PM X also autoprocesses to generate different isoforms. The function of this processing is not understood. We have mapped the self-cleavage sites and have constructed parasites with cleavage site mutations. Surprisingly, a quadruple mutant that remains full-length retains in vitro activity, is trafficked normally, and supports normal egress, invasion and parasite growth. The N-terminal half of the prodomain stays bound to the catalytic domain even after processing and is required for proper intracellular trafficking of PM X. We find that this enzyme cleaves microneme and exoneme substrates before discharge, while the rhoptry substrates that are dependent on PM X activity are cleaved after exoneme discharge into the PV. The data give insight into the temporal, spatial and biochemical control of this unusual but important aspartic protease.","Egress of Plasmodium from host erythrocytes is mediated by effector proteins. Aspartic protease plasmepsin X (PM X) regulates the activity for many of these effectors, is essential for replication and is a promising drug target. Here, Mukherjee et al. map the self-cleavage sites of PM X, show that the N-terminal part of its prodomain is required for intracellular trafficking and correlate the maturation and subcellular activity of PM X in microneme, exoneme and rhoptry organelle function.",2022-08-04
988,Accurate determination of CRISPR-mediated gene fitness in transplantable tumours,"Assessing tumour gene fitness in physiologically-relevant model systems is challenging due to biological features of in vivo tumour regeneration, including extreme variations in single cell lineage progeny. Here we develop a reproducible, quantitative approach to pooled genetic perturbation in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), by encoding single cell output from transplanted CRISPR-transduced cells in combination with a Bayesian hierarchical model. We apply this to 181 PDX transplants from 21 breast cancer patients. We show that uncertainty in fitness estimates depends critically on the number of transplant cell clones and the variability in clone sizes. We use a pathway-directed allelic series to characterize Notch signaling, and quantify TP53 / MDM2 drug-gene conditional fitness in outlier patients. We show that fitness outlier identification can be mirrored by pharmacological perturbation. Overall, we demonstrate that the gene fitness landscape in breast PDXs is dominated by inter-patient differences.","Gene fitness and essentiality analyses using in vivo cancer models are challenging due to multiple confounders. Here, the authors develop a quantitative approach to study CRISPR-transduced patient-derived xenografts, which they use to analyse in vivo gene fitness in breast cancers and the biological features that influence uncertainty in fitness estimation.",2022-08-04
989,Deficiency of WTAP in hepatocytes induces lipoatrophy and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),"Ectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation are the essential signs of NASH. However, the molecular mechanisms of ectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation during NASH progression are not fully understood. Here we reported that hepatic Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) is a key integrative regulator of ectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation during NASH progression. Hepatic deletion of Wtap leads to NASH due to the increased lipolysis in white adipose tissue, enhanced hepatic free fatty acids uptake and induced inflammation, all of which are mediated by IGFBP1, CD36 and cytochemokines such as CCL2, respectively. WTAP binds to specific DNA motifs which are enriched in the promoters and suppresses gene expression (e.g., Igfbp1, Cd36 and Ccl2) with the involvement of HDAC1. In NASH, WTAP is tranlocated from nucleus to cytosol, which is related to CDK9-mediated phosphorylation. These data uncover a mechanism by which hepatic WTAP regulates ectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation during NASH progression.","Ectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation are the essential signs of NASH. Here, the authors show that hepatic WTAP is a key integrative repressor of ectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation during NASH progression, and hepatic deletion of Wtap promotes both of them, leading to NASH",2022-08-04
990,Cingulate-motor circuits update rule representations for sequential choice decisions,"Anterior cingulate cortex mediates the flexible updating of an animal’s choice responses upon rule changes in the environment. However, how anterior cingulate cortex entrains motor cortex to reorganize rule representations and generate required motor outputs remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that chemogenetic silencing of the terminal projections of cingulate cortical neurons in secondary motor cortex in the rat disrupts choice performance in trials immediately following rule switches, suggesting that these inputs are necessary to update rule representations for choice decisions stored in the motor cortex. Indeed, the silencing of cingulate cortex decreases rule selectivity of secondary motor cortical neurons. Furthermore, optogenetic silencing of cingulate cortical neurons that is temporally targeted to error trials immediately after rule switches exacerbates errors in the following trials. These results suggest that cingulate cortex monitors behavioral errors and updates rule representations in motor cortex, revealing a critical role for cingulate-motor circuits in adaptive choice behaviors.","The anterior cingulate cortex allows an animal to update its behaviour when the environment changes. In this work, the authors identify a pathway from cingulate to secondary motor cortex, critical for updating motor rules following behavioural errors.",2022-08-04
991,Ligand-specific conformational change drives interdomain allostery in Pin1,"Pin1 is a two-domain cell regulator that isomerizes peptidyl-prolines. The catalytic domain (PPIase) and the other ligand-binding domain (WW) sample extended and compact conformations. Ligand binding changes the equilibrium of the interdomain conformations, but the conformational changes that lead to the altered domain sampling were unknown. Prior evidence has supported an interdomain allosteric mechanism. We recently introduced a magnetic resonance-based protocol that allowed us to determine the coupling of intra- and interdomain structural sampling in apo Pin1. Here, we describe ligand-specific conformational changes that occur upon binding of pCDC25c and FFpSPR. pCDC25c binding doubles the population of the extended states compared to the virtually identical populations of the apo and FFpSPR-bound forms. pCDC25c binding to the WW domain triggers conformational changes to propagate via the interdomain interface to the catalytic site, while FFpSPR binding displaces a helix in the PPIase that leads to repositioning of the PPIase catalytic loop.",Born et al. describe interdomain allostery in the two domain peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 upon binding of two ligands.

992,Revealing the role of liquid preordering in crystallisation of supercooled liquids,"The recent discovery of non-classical crystal nucleation pathways has revealed the role of fluctuations in the liquid structural order, not considered in classical nucleation theory. On the other hand, classical crystal growth theory states that crystal growth is independent of interfacial energy, but this is questionable. Here we elucidate the role of liquid structural ordering in crystal nucleation and growth using computer simulations of supercooled liquids. We find that suppressing the crystal-like structural order in the supercooled liquid through a new order-killing strategy can reduce the crystallisation rate by several orders of magnitude. This indicates that crystal-like liquid preordering and the associated interfacial energy reduction play an essential role in nucleation and growth processes, forcing critical modifications of the classical crystal growth theory. Furthermore, we evaluate the importance of this additional factor for different types of liquids. These findings shed new light on the fundamental understanding of crystal growth kinetics.","In classical nucleation theory, structural order in the liquid phase is not considered. But simulations of supercooled liquids now show that crystal-like liquid preordering play an essential role in nucleation and growth processes - calling for extensions of the classical theory.",2022-08-04
993,A public antibody class recognizes an S2 epitope exposed on open conformations of SARS-CoV-2 spike,"Delineating the origins and properties of antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination is critical for understanding their benefits and potential shortcomings. Therefore, we investigate the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-reactive B cell repertoire in unexposed individuals by flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing. We show that ∼82% of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive B cells harbor a naive phenotype, which represents an unusually high fraction of total human naive B cells (∼0.1%). Approximately 10% of these naive S-reactive B cells share an IGHV1-69/IGKV3-11 B cell receptor pairing, an enrichment of 18-fold compared to the complete naive repertoire. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we report an average 37-fold enrichment of IGHV1-69/IGKV3-11 B cell receptor pairing in the S-reactive memory B cells compared to the unselected memory repertoire. This class of B cells targets a previously undefined non-neutralizing epitope on the S2 subunit that becomes exposed on S proteins used in approved vaccines when they transition away from the native pre-fusion state because of instability. These findings can help guide the improvement of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","To fully understand the potential shortcomings of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, it is necessary to delineate the properties of the antibodies elicited, during immunization, and also infection. Through investigation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive B cell repertoire, authors identify following infection, a subset of B cells enriched and almost exclusively target a non-neutralizing S2 epitope present in aberrant forms.",2022-08-04
994,Poly(ADP) ribose polymerase promotes DNA polymerase theta-mediated end joining by activation of end resection,"The DNA polymerase theta (Polθ)-mediated end joining (TMEJ) pathway for repair of chromosomal double strand breaks (DSBs) is essential in cells deficient in other DSB repair pathways, including hereditary breast cancers defective in homologous recombination. Strand-break activated poly(ADP) ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) has been implicated in TMEJ, but the modest specificity of existing TMEJ assays means the extent of effect and the mechanism behind it remain unclear. We describe here a series of TMEJ assays with improved specificity and show ablation of PARP activity reduces TMEJ activity 2-4-fold. The reduction in TMEJ is attributable to a reduction in the 5’ to 3’ resection of DSB ends that is essential for engagement of this pathway and is compensated by increased repair by the nonhomologous-end joining pathway. This limited role for PARP activity in TMEJ helps better rationalize the combined employment of inhibitors of PARP and Polθ in cancer therapy.","Poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) activity promotes, but is not required for, chromosome break repair by polymerase theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). PARP activity promotes TMEJ by stimulating resection, a process that controls pathway choice.",2022-08-04
995,Subversion of GBP-mediated host defense by E3 ligases acquired during Yersinia pestis evolution,"Plague has caused three worldwide pandemics in history, including the Black Death in medieval ages. Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of plague, has evolved a powerful arsenal to disrupt host immune defenses during evolution from enteropathogenic Y. pseudotuberculosis. Here, we find that two functionally redundant E3 ligase of Y. pestis, YspE1 and YspE2, can be delivered via type III secretion injectisome into host cytosol where they ubiquitinate multiple guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) for proteasomal degradation. However, Y. pseudotuberculosis has no such capability due to lacking functional YspE1/2 homologs. YspE1/2-mediated GBP degradations significantly promote the survival of Y. pestis in macrophages and strongly inhibit inflammasome activation. By contrast, Gbpchr3−/−, chr5−/− macrophages exhibit much lowered inflammasome activation independent of YspE1/2, accompanied with an enhanced replication of Y. pestis. Accordingly, Gbpchr3−/−, chr5−/− mice are more susceptible to Y. pestis. We demonstrate that Y. pestis utilizes E3 ligases to subvert GBP-mediated host defense, which appears to be newly acquired by Y. pestis during evolution.","Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) recognize pathogen containing vacuoles, leading to lysis of this intracellular niche and induction of inflammasomes. Here, Cao et al. show that Y. pestis, the causative agent of plague, secret two functionally redundant E3 ligase, YspE1 and YspE2, into the host’s cytosol to ubiquitinate multiple GBPs for proteasomal degradation to subvert host immune defense. This capability appears to be newly acquired by Y. pestis during evolution, since its closely related progenitor Y. pseudotuberculosis is unable to do so.",2022-08-04
996,Unjamming and emergent nonreciprocity in active ploughing through a compressible viscoelastic fluid,"A dilute suspension of active Brownian particles in a dense compressible viscoelastic fluid, forms a natural setting to study the emergence of nonreciprocity during a dynamical phase transition. At these densities, the transport of active particles is strongly influenced by the passive medium and shows a dynamical jamming transition as a function of activity and medium density. In the process, the compressible medium is actively churned up – for low activity, the active particle gets self-trapped in a cavity of its own making, while for large activity, the active particle ploughs through the medium, either accompanied by a moving anisotropic wake, or leaving a porous trail. A hydrodynamic approach makes it evident that the active particle generates a long-range density wake which breaks fore-aft symmetry, consistent with the simulations. Accounting for the back-reaction of the compressible medium leads to (i) dynamical jamming of the active particle, and (ii) a dynamical non-reciprocal attraction between two active particles moving along the same direction, with the trailing particle catching up with the leading one in finite time. We emphasize that these nonreciprocal effects appear only when the active particles are moving and so manifest in the vicinity of the jamming-unjamming transition.","The field of dense active matter has been the fount of many intriguing phenomena. Here, authors show that nonreciprocal interactions can emerge between active particles due to a dynamical feedback between their motility and the corresponding slow remodelling of a dense passive compressible medium.",2022-08-04
997,Non-fluorinated non-solvating cosolvent enabling superior performance of lithium metal negative electrode battery,"The growth of dendrites on lithium metal electrodes is problematic because it causes irreversible capacity loss and safety hazards. Localised high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) can form a mechanically stable solid-electrolyte interphase and prevent uneven growth of lithium metal. However, the optimal physicochemical properties of LHCEs have not been clearly determined which limits the choice to fluorinated non-solvating cosolvents (FNSCs). Also, FNSCs in LHCEs raise environmental concerns, are costly, and may cause low cathodic stability owing to their low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level, leading to unsatisfactory cycle life. Here, we spectroscopically measured the Li+ solvation ability and miscibility of candidate non-fluorinated non-solvating cosolvents (NFNSCs) and identified the suitable physicochemical properties for non-solvating cosolvents. Using our design principle, we proposed NFNSCs that deliver a coulombic efficiency up to 99.0% over 1400 cycles. NMR spectra revealed that the designed NFNSCs were highly stable in electrolytes during extended cycles. In addition, solvation structure analysis by Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculation of Li+ binding energy suggested that the low ability of these NFNSCs to solvate Li+ originates from the aromatic ring that allows delocalisation of electron pairs on the oxygen atom.","Localised high-concentration electrolyte is key to prevent uneven growth of lithium metal by forming a mechanically stable solid-electrolyte interphase. Here, the authors identify the suitable physicochemical properties for non-solvating co-solvents that improve the performance of lithium metal battery.",2022-08-04
998,Cobalt-catalyzed branched selective hydroallylation of terminal alkynes,"Here, we reported a cobalt-hydride-catalyzed Markovnikov-type hydroallylation of terminal alkynes with allylic electrophile to access valuable and branched skipped dienes (1,4-dienes) with good regioselectivity. This operationally simple protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and exceptional substrate scope. The reactions could be carried out in gram-scale with TON (turn over number) up to 1160, and the products could be easily derivatized. The preliminary mechanism of electrophilic allylation of α-selective cobalt alkenyl intermediate was proposed based on deuterium labeling experiment and kinetic studies.","Selectively generating “skipped” dienes, where two carbon–carbon double bonds are separated by a saturated carbon center, is an interesting problem in organic chemistry, with few reliable, catalytic methods currently available. Here, the authors report branched selective hydroallylation of terminal alkynes with allylic bromides to form skipped dienes, via cobalt catalysis.",2022-08-03
999,Three types of genes underlying the Gametophyte factor1 locus cause unilateral cross incompatibility in maize,"Unilateral cross incompatibility (UCI) occurs between popcorn and dent corn, and represents a critical step towards speciation. It has been reported that ZmGa1P, encoding a pectin methylesterase (PME), is a male determinant of the Ga1 locus. However, the female determinant and the genetic relationship between male and female determinants at this locus are unclear. Here, we report three different types, a total of seven linked genes underlying the Ga1 locus, which control UCI phenotype by independently affecting pollen tube growth in both antagonistic and synergistic manners. These include five pollen-expressed PME genes (ZmGa1Ps-m), a silk-expressed PME gene (ZmPME3), and another silk-expressed gene (ZmPRP3), encoding a pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. ZmGa1Ps-m confer pollen compatibility. Presence of ZmPME3 causes silk to reject incompatible pollen. ZmPRP3 promotes incompatibility pollen tube growth and thereby breaks the blocking effect of ZmPME3. In addition, evolutionary genomics analyses suggest that the divergence of the Ga1 locus existed before maize domestication and continued during breeding improvement. The knowledge gained here deepen our understanding of the complex regulation of cross incompatibility.","Unilateral cross incompatibility (UCI) is a type of prezygotic reproductive isolation, which is associated with multiple loci in maize. Here, the authors use genetic analysis to separate the Ga1 locus into two functional components and identify seven linked genes encoding three types of proteins.",2022-08-03
1000,In mouse chronic pancreatitis CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells control pancreatic fibrosis by suppression of the type 2 immune response,"Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is characterized by chronic inflammation and the progressive fibrotic replacement of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic tissue. We identify Treg cells as central regulators of the fibroinflammatory reaction by a selective depletion of FOXP3-positive cells in a transgenic mouse model (DEREG-mice) of experimental CP. In Treg-depleted DEREG-mice, the induction of CP results in a significantly increased stroma deposition, the development of exocrine insufficiency and significant weight loss starting from day 14 after disease onset. In CP, FOXP3+CD25+ Treg cells suppress the type-2 immune response by a repression of GATA3+ T helper cells (Th2), GATA3+ innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2) and CD206+ M2-macrophages. A suspected pathomechanism behind the fibrotic tissue replacement may involve an observed dysbalance of Activin A expression in macrophages and of its counter regulator follistatin. Our study identified Treg cells as key regulators of the type-2 immune response and of organ remodeling during CP. The Treg/Th2 axis could be a therapeutic target to prevent fibrosis and preserve functional pancreatic tissue.",The function of T regulatory cells in the tissue fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis is not fully understood. Here the authors use a mouse model of chronic pancreatitis to show that Treg cells reduce IL-4 mediated chronic inflammation in the pancreas associated with M2-like macrophages in vivo.,2022-08-03
1001,Reconfigurable hyperbolic polaritonics with correlated oxide metasurfaces,"Polaritons enable subwavelength confinement and highly anisotropic flows of light over a wide spectral range, holding the promise for applications in modern nanophotonic and optoelectronic devices. However, to fully realize their practical application potential, facile methods enabling nanoscale active control of polaritons are needed. Here, we introduce a hybrid polaritonic-oxide heterostructure platform consisting of van der Waals crystals, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) or alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO3), transferred on nanoscale oxygen vacancy patterns on the surface of prototypical correlated perovskite oxide, samarium nickel oxide, SmNiO3 (SNO). Using a combination of scanning probe microscopy and infrared nanoimaging techniques, we demonstrate nanoscale reconfigurability of complex hyperbolic phonon polaritons patterned at the nanoscale with high resolution. Hydrogenation and temperature modulation allow spatially localized conductivity modulation of SNO nanoscale patterns, enabling robust real-time modulation and nanoscale reconfiguration of hyperbolic polaritons. Our work paves the way towards nanoscale programmable metasurface engineering for reconfigurable nanophotonic applications.","Phonon polaritons in anisotropic van der Waals materials enable subwavelength confinement and controllable flow of light at the nanoscale. Here, the authors exploit correlated perovskite oxide (SmNiO3) substrates with tunable conductivity to obtain real-time modulation and nanoscale reconfiguration of hyperbolic polaritons in hBN and α-MoO3 crystals.",2022-08-03
1002,Explaining a series of models by propagating Shapley values,"Local feature attribution methods are increasingly used to explain complex machine learning models. However, current methods are limited because they are extremely expensive to compute or are not capable of explaining a distributed series of models where each model is owned by a separate institution. The latter is particularly important because it often arises in finance where explanations are mandated. Here, we present Generalized DeepSHAP (G-DeepSHAP), a tractable method to propagate local feature attributions through complex series of models based on a connection to the Shapley value. We evaluate G-DeepSHAP across biological, health, and financial datasets to show that it provides equally salient explanations an order of magnitude faster than existing model-agnostic attribution techniques and demonstrate its use in an important distributed series of models setting.","Series of machine learning models, relevant for tasks in biology, medicine, and finance, usually involve complex feature attribution techniques. The authors introduce a tractable method to compute local feature attributions for a series of machine learning models inspired by connections to the Shapley value.",2022-08-03
1003,Fate mapping of hematopoietic stem cells reveals two pathways of native thrombopoiesis,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce highly diverse cell lineages. Here, we chart native lineage pathways emanating from HSCs and define their physiological regulation by computationally integrating experimental approaches for fate mapping, mitotic tracking, and single-cell RNA sequencing. We find that lineages begin to split when cells leave the tip HSC population, marked by high Sca-1 and CD201 expression. Downstream, HSCs either retain high Sca-1 expression and the ability to generate lymphocytes, or irreversibly reduce Sca-1 level and enter into erythro-myelopoiesis or thrombopoiesis. Thrombopoiesis is the sum of two pathways that make comparable contributions in steady state, a long route via multipotent progenitors and CD48hi megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs), and a short route from HSCs to developmentally distinct CD48−/lo MkPs. Enhanced thrombopoietin signaling differentially accelerates the short pathway, enabling a rapid response to increasing demand. In sum, we provide a blueprint for mapping physiological differentiation fluxes from HSCs and decipher two functionally distinct pathways of native thrombopoiesis.","Hematopoietic stem cells produce diverse cell lineages. Here, the authors apply single-cell RNA-seq, computational integration of non-perturbative approaches for fate-mapping, and mitotic tracking to chart lineage decisions in native hematopoiesis and identify megakaryocyte progenitors that directly link HSCs to megakaryocytes.",2022-08-03
1004,Genome-wide associations of aortic distensibility suggest causality for aortic aneurysms and brain white matter hyperintensities,"Aortic dimensions and distensibility are key risk factors for aortic aneurysms and dissections, as well as for other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. We present genome-wide associations of ascending and descending aortic distensibility and area derived from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of up to 32,590 Caucasian individuals in UK Biobank. We identify 102 loci (including 27 novel associations) tagging genes related to cardiovascular development, extracellular matrix production, smooth muscle cell contraction and heritable aortic diseases. Functional analyses highlight four signalling pathways associated with aortic distensibility (TGF-β, IGF, VEGF and PDGF). We identify distinct sex-specific associations with aortic traits. We develop co-expression networks associated with aortic traits and apply phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR-PheWAS), generating evidence for a causal role for aortic distensibility in development of aortic aneurysms. Multivariable MR suggests a causal relationship between aortic distensibility and cerebral white matter hyperintensities, mechanistically linking aortic traits and brain small vessel disease.","Aortic distensibility is a risk factor for multiple cardiovascular events, but the genetic etiology is not well understood. Here, the authors identify genetic variants linked to aortic distensibility, highlighting mechanistic pathways and causal relationships between distensibility and both aortic aneurysms and brain small vessel disease.",2022-08-03
1005,Histone H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 form a chromatin platform essential for DNMT3A-dependent DNA methylation in mouse oocytes,"Establishment of the DNA methylation landscape of mammalian oocytes, mediated by the DNMT3A-DNMT3L complex, is crucial for reproduction and development. In mouse oocytes, high levels of DNA methylation occur exclusively in the transcriptionally active regions, with moderate to low levels of methylation in other regions. Histone H3K36me3 mediates the high levels of methylation in the transcribed regions; however, it is unknown which histone mark guides the methylation in the other regions. Here, we show that, in mouse oocytes, H3K36me2 is highly enriched in the X chromosome and is broadly distributed across all autosomes. Upon H3K36me2 depletion, DNA methylation in moderately methylated regions is selectively affected, and a methylation pattern unique to the X chromosome is switched to an autosome-like pattern. Furthermore, we find that simultaneous depletion of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 results in global hypomethylation, comparable to that of DNMT3A depletion. Therefore, the two histone marks jointly provide the chromatin platform essential for guiding DNMT3A-dependent DNA methylation in mouse oocytes.","DNMT3A is known to methylate DNA at histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3)-marked transcriptionally active regions in mouse oocytes. Here the authors show that DNMT3A is also guided by H3K36me2 to methylate broad domains in genic and intergenic loci, as well as on the X chromosome. These two histone marks together comprise the minimal chromatin signature for global DNA methylation in mouse oocytes.",2022-08-03
1006,Atomic-scale thermopower in charge density wave states,"The microscopic origins of thermopower have been investigated to design efficient thermoelectric devices, but strongly correlated quantum states such as charge density waves and Mott insulating phase remain to be explored for atomic-scale thermopower engineering. Here, we report on thermopower and phonon puddles in the charge density wave states in 1T-TaS2, probed by scanning thermoelectric microscopy. The Star-of-David clusters of atoms in 1T-TaS2 exhibit counterintuitive variations in thermopower with broken three-fold symmetry at the atomic scale, originating from the localized nature of valence electrons and their interlayer coupling in the Mott insulating charge density waves phase of 1T-TaS2. Additionally, phonon puddles are observed with a spatial range shorter than the conventional mean free path of phonons, revealing the phonon propagation and scattering in the subsurface structures of 1T-TaS2.","Microscopic origins of thermopower are investigated to design efficient thermoelectric devices. Here, the authors report thermopower and phonon puddles in the charge density wave states in 1T-TaS2 by scanning thermoelectric microscopy.",2022-08-03
1007,Optoelectronic system and device integration for quantum-dot light-emitting diode white lighting with computational design framework,"We propose a computational design framework to design the architecture of a white lighting system having multiple pixelated patterns of electric-field-driven quantum dot light-emitting diodes. The quantum dot of the white lighting system has been optimised by a system-level combinatorial colour optimisation process with the Nelder-Mead algorithm used for machine learning. The layout of quantum dot patterns is designed precisely using rigorous device-level charge transport simulation with an electric-field dependent charge injection model. A theoretical maximum of 97% colour rendering index has been achieved with red, green, cyan, and blue quantum dot light-emitting diodes as primary colours. The white lighting system has been fabricated using the transfer printing technique to validate the computational design framework. It exhibits excellent lighting performance of 92% colour rendering index and wide colour temperature variation from 1612 K to 8903 K with only the four pixelated quantum dots as primary.","Next generation smart lighting requires high colour rendering and wide colour controllability. Here, Jung et al. realise, via a systematic colour optimisation and a computational charge transport simulation, white quantum dot light-emitting diodes with high colour performance.",2022-08-03
1008,The role of gene expression and symbiosis in reef-building coral acquired heat tolerance,"Predicting how reef-building corals will respond to accelerating ocean warming caused by climate change requires knowledge of how acclimation and symbiosis modulate heat tolerance in coral early life-history stages. We assayed transcriptional responses to heat in larvae and juveniles of 11 reproductive crosses of Acropora tenuis colonies along the Great Barrier Reef. Larvae produced from the warmest reef had the highest heat tolerance, although gene expression responses to heat were largely conserved by cross identity. Juvenile transcriptional responses were driven strongly by symbiosis – when in symbiosis with heat-evolved Symbiodiniaceae, hosts displayed intermediate expression between its progenitor Cladocopium and the more stress tolerant Durusdinium, indicating the acquisition of tolerance is a conserved evolutionary process in symbionts. Heat-evolved Symbiodiniaceae facilitated juvenile survival under heat stress, although host transcriptional responses to heat were positively correlated among those hosting different genera of Symbiodiniaceae. These findings reveal the relative contribution of parental environmental history as well as symbiosis establishment in coral molecular responses to heat in early life-history stages.","Coral responses to ocean warming depend not only on the coral themselves, but also on their symbionts. Here, the authors experimentally assess how symbiosis and gene expression plasticity contribute to the heat stress responses of a common coral.",2022-08-03
1009,Identification of IOMA-class neutralizing antibodies targeting the CD4-binding site on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein,"A major goal of current HIV-1 vaccine design efforts is to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). The VH1-2-derived bNAb IOMA directed to the CD4-binding site of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is of interest because, unlike the better-known VH1-2-derived VRC01-class bNAbs, it does not require a rare short light chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRL3). Here, we describe three IOMA-class NAbs, ACS101-103, with up to 37% breadth, that share many characteristics with IOMA, including an average-length CDRL3. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that ACS101 shares interactions with those observed with other VH1-2 and VH1-46-class bNAbs, but exhibits a unique binding mode to residues in loop D. Analysis of longitudinal sequences from the patient suggests that a transmitter/founder-virus lacking the N276 glycan might have initiated the development of these NAbs. Together these data strengthen the rationale for germline-targeting vaccination strategies to induce IOMA-class bNAbs and provide a wealth of sequence and structural information to support such strategies.","HIV-1 vaccine design aims to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies such as IOMA, the only described antibody in its class. Here, the authors present the isolation, characterisation and structure of three additional antibodies within the IOMA class",2022-08-03
1010,AvmM catalyses macrocyclization through dehydration/Michael-type addition in alchivemycin A biosynthesis,"Macrocyclization is an important process that affords morphed scaffold in biosynthesis of bioactive natural products. Nature has adapted diverse biosynthetic strategies to form macrocycles. In this work, we report the identification and characterization of a small enzyme AvmM that can catalyze the construction of a 16-membered macrocyclic ring in the biosynthesis of alchivemycin A (1). We show through in vivo gene deletion, in vitro biochemical assay and isotope labelling experiments that AvmM catalyzes tandem dehydration and Michael-type addition to generate the core scaffold of 1. Mechanistic studies by crystallography, DFT calculations and MD simulations of AvmM reveal that the reactions are achieved with assistance from the special tenuazonic acid like moiety of substrate. Our results thus uncover an uncharacterized macrocyclization strategy in natural product biosynthesis.","Macrocyclization is an important process in bioactive natural product synthesis. Here, the authors report on the study of a macrocyclic ring constructing enzyme in the biosynthesis of alchivemycin A and using gene deletion, biochemical assays and isotope labelling show the enzyme catalyses tandem dehydration and Michael-type addition.",2022-08-03
1011,Dynamic actuation enhances transport and extends therapeutic lifespan in an implantable drug delivery platform,"Fibrous capsule (FC) formation, secondary to the foreign body response (FBR), impedes molecular transport and is detrimental to the long-term efficacy of implantable drug delivery devices, especially when tunable, temporal control is necessary. We report the development of an implantable mechanotherapeutic drug delivery platform to mitigate and overcome this host immune response using two distinct, yet synergistic soft robotic strategies. Firstly, daily intermittent actuation (cycling at 1 Hz for 5 minutes every 12 hours) preserves long-term, rapid delivery of a model drug (insulin) over 8 weeks of implantation, by mediating local immunomodulation of the cellular FBR and inducing multiphasic temporal FC changes. Secondly, actuation-mediated rapid release of therapy can enhance mass transport and therapeutic effect with tunable, temporal control. In a step towards clinical translation, we utilise a minimally invasive percutaneous approach to implant a scaled-up device in a human cadaveric model. Our soft actuatable platform has potential clinical utility for a variety of indications where transport is affected by fibrosis, such as the management of type 1 diabetes.","Drug delivery implants suffer from diminished release profiles due to fibrous capsule formation over time. Here, the authors use soft robotic actuation to modulate the immune response of the host to maintain drug delivery over the longer-term and to perform controlled release in vivo.",2022-08-03
1012,Thermodynamics of organic electrochemical transistors,"Despite their increasing usefulness in a wide variety of applications, organic electrochemical transistors still lack a comprehensive and unifying physical framework able to describe the current-voltage characteristics and the polymer/electrolyte interactions simultaneously. Building upon thermodynamic axioms, we present a quantitative analysis of the operation of organic electrochemical transistors. We reveal that the entropy of mixing is the main driving force behind the redox mechanism that rules the transfer properties of such devices in electrolytic environments. In the light of these findings, we show that traditional models used for organic electrochemical transistors, based on the theory of field-effect transistors, fall short as they treat the active material as a simple capacitor while ignoring the material properties and energetic interactions. Finally, by analyzing a large spectrum of solvents and device regimes, we quantify the entropic and enthalpic contributions and put forward an approach for targeted material design and device applications.","Though models describing the operating mechanism of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have been developed, these models are unable to accurately reproduce OECT electrical characteristics. Here, the authors report a thermodynamic-based framework that accurately models OECT operation.",2022-08-03
1013,Selective separation of light rare-earth elements by supramolecular encapsulation and precipitation,"Supramolecular chemical strategies for Rare Earth (RE) element separations are emerging which amplify the small changes in properties across the series to bias selectivity in extraction or precipitation. These advances are important as the REs are crucial to modern technologies yet their extraction, separation, and recycling using conventional techniques remain challenging. We report here a pre-organised triamidoarene platform which, under acidic, biphasic conditions, uniquely and selectively precipitates light RE nitratometalates as supramolecular capsules. The capsules exhibit both intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds that dictate selectivity, promote precipitation, and facilitate the straightforward release of the RE and recycling of the receptor. This work provides a self-assembly route to metal separations that exploits size and shape complementarity and has the potential to integrate into conventional processes due to its compatibility with acidic metal feed streams.","The separation of the rare-earth elements is a significant scientific challenge. Here, the authors report the selective precipitation of the light rare-earths as supramolecular capsules from acidic, industrially relevant, mixed-metal solutions.",2022-08-03
1014,Dynamics of a national Omicron SARS-CoV-2 epidemic during January 2022 in England,"Rapid transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has led to record-breaking case incidence rates around the world. Since May 2020, the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study tracked the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England through RT-PCR of self-administered throat and nose swabs from randomly-selected participants aged 5 years and over. In January 2022, we found an overall weighted prevalence of 4.41% (n = 102,174), three-fold higher than in November to December 2021; we sequenced 2,374 (99.2%) Omicron infections (19 BA.2), and only 19 (0.79%) Delta, with a growth rate advantage for BA.2 compared to BA.1 or BA.1.1. Prevalence was decreasing overall (reproduction number R = 0.95, 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.93, 0.97), but increasing in children aged 5 to 17 years (R = 1.13, 95% CrI, 1.09, 1.18). In England during January 2022, we observed unprecedented levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially among children, driven by almost complete replacement of Delta by Omicron.","The REACT-1 study measures the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England through repeated cross-sectional surveys. Here, the authors present data from REACT-1 that document the increase in infection prevalence, particularly among children, associated with the Omicron variant in January 2022.",2022-08-03
1015,Exchange-induced spin polarization in a single magnetic molecule junction,"Many spintronic devices rely on the presence of spin-polarized currents at zero magnetic field. This is often obtained by spin exchange-bias, where an element with long-range magnetic order creates magnetized states and displaces the hysteresis loop. Here we demonstrate that exchange-split spin states are observable and usable in the smallest conceivable unit: a single magnetic molecule. We use a redox-active porphyrin as a transport channel, coordinating a dysprosium-based single-molecule-magnet inside a graphene nano-gap. Single-molecule transport in magnetic field reveals the existence of exchange-split channels with different spin-polarizations that depend strongly on the field orientation, and comparison with the diamagnetic isostructural compound and milikelvin torque magnetometry unravels the role of the single-molecule anisotropy and the molecular orientation. These results open a path to using spin-exchange in molecular electronics, and offer a method to quantify the internal spin structure of single molecules in multiple oxidation states.","The spin exchange, which is central to spintronics, has been restricted to devices with long-range magnetic ordering to date. Here, Pei et al. design a single-molecule-magnet and utilize its internal spin exchange to control the current through a single-molecule junction with high spin polarization (>95%).",2022-08-03
1016,An intranasal ASO therapeutic targeting SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic is exacting an increasing toll worldwide, with new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging that exhibit higher infectivity rates and that may partially evade vaccine and antibody immunity. Rapid deployment of non-invasive therapeutic avenues capable of preventing infection by all SARS-CoV-2 variants could complement current vaccination efforts and help turn the tide on the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe a novel therapeutic strategy targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA using locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA ASOs). We identify an LNA ASO binding to the 5′ leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that disrupts a highly conserved stem-loop structure with nanomolar efficacy in preventing viral replication in human cells. Daily intranasal administration of this LNA ASO in the COVID-19 mouse model potently suppresses viral replication (>80-fold) in the lungs of infected mice. We find that the LNA ASO is efficacious in countering all SARS-CoV-2 “variants of concern” tested both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, inhaled LNA ASOs targeting SARS-CoV-2 represents a promising therapeutic approach to reduce or prevent transmission and decrease severity of COVID-19 in infected individuals. LNA ASOs are chemically stable and can be flexibly modified to target different viral RNA sequences and could be stockpiled for future coronavirus pandemics.","Despite approved vaccines and anti-virals to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is a need for further development of efficient antiviral therapeutic strategy. Here, Zhu et al. develop locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA ASOs) targeting the 5’ leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to interfere with replication of wildtype virus and variants of concern. Daily intranasal administration in K18-hACE2 humanized mice suppresses viral infection in lung.",2022-08-03
1017,The spatio-temporal evolution of multiple myeloma from baseline to relapse-refractory states,"Deciphering Multiple Myeloma evolution in the whole bone marrow is key to inform curative strategies. Here, we perform spatial-longitudinal whole-exome sequencing, including 140 samples collected from 24 Multiple Myeloma patients during up to 14 years. Applying imaging-guided sampling we observe three evolutionary patterns, including relapse driven by a single-cell expansion, competing/co-existing sub-clones, and unique sub-clones at distinct locations. While we do not find the unique relapse sub-clone in the baseline focal lesion(s), we show a close phylogenetic relationship between baseline focal lesions and relapse disease, highlighting focal lesions as hotspots of tumor evolution. In patients with ≥3 focal lesions on positron-emission-tomography at diagnosis, relapse is driven by multiple distinct sub-clones, whereas in other patients, a single-cell expansion is typically seen (p < 0.01). Notably, we observe resistant sub-clones that can be hidden over years, suggesting that a prerequisite for curative therapies would be to overcome not only tumor heterogeneity but also dormancy.","Spatially and temporally resolved data can improve our understanding of evolution and treatment resistance in multiple myeloma (MM). Here, the authors analyse spatial and longitudinal heterogeneity in MM patients using multi-region sequencing, and identify subclones associated with relapse and therapy resistance.",2022-08-03
1018,Coarse sea spray inhibits lightning,"The known effects of thermodynamics and aerosols can well explain the thunderstorm activity over land, but fail over oceans. Here, tracking the full lifecycle of tropical deep convective cloud clusters shows that adding fine aerosols significantly increases the lightning density for a given rainfall amount over both ocean and land. In contrast, adding coarse sea salt (dry radius > 1 μm), known as sea spray, weakens the cloud vigor and lightning by producing fewer but larger cloud drops, which accelerate warm rain at the expense of mixed-phase precipitation. Adding coarse sea spray can reduce the lightning by 90% regardless of fine aerosol loading. These findings reconcile long outstanding questions about the differences between continental and marine thunderstorms, and help to understand lightning and underlying aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction mechanisms and their climatic effects.","Previous hypotheses cannot fully explain the large lightning excess over land compared to ocean. It is found that coarse sea spray that create large drops precipitates cloud water before it can freeze, thus robbing the fuel for cloud electrification",2022-08-02
1019,Effectiveness of REGEN-COV antibody combination in preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes,"REGEN-COV, a combination of the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab, has been approved as a treatment for high-risk patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 within five days of their diagnosis. We performed a retrospective cohort study, and used data repositories of Israel’s largest healthcare organization to determine the real-world effectiveness of REGEN-COV treatment against COVID-19-related hospitalization, severe disease, and death. We compared patients infected with Delta variant and treated with REGEN-COV (n = 289) to those infected but not-treated with REGEN-COV (n = 1,296). Demographic and clinical characteristics were used to match patients and for further adjustment as part of the C0x model. Estimated treatment effectiveness was defined as one minus the hazard ratio. Treatment effectiveness of REGEN-COV was 56.4% (95% CI: 23.7–75.1%) in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization, 59.2% (95% CI: 19.9–79.2%) in preventing severe COVID-19, and 93.5% (95% CI: 52.1–99.1%) in preventing COVID-19 death in the 28 days after treatment. In conclusion, REGEN-COV was effective in reducing the risk of severe sequelae in high-risk COVID-19 patients.","REGEN-COV is a SARS-CoV-2 combined monoclonal antibody treatment which has been shown to be effective in randomised controlled trials.

1020,CAF08 adjuvant enables single dose protection against respiratory syncytial virus infection in murine newborns,"Respiratory syncytial virus is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children, due in part to their distinct immune system, characterized by impaired induction of Th 1 immunity. Here we show application of cationic adjuvant formulation CAF08, a liposomal vaccine formulation tailored to induce Th 1 immunity in early life via synergistic engagement of Toll-like Receptor 7/8 and the C-type lectin receptor Mincle. We apply quantitative phosphoproteomics to human dendritic cells and reveal a role for Protein Kinase C-δ for enhanced Th1 cytokine production in neonatal dendritic cells and identify signaling events resulting in antigen cross-presentation. In a murine in vivo model a single immunization at birth with CAF08-adjuvanted RSV pre-fusion antigen protects newborn mice from RSV infection by induction of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells and Th1 cells. Overall, we describe a pediatric adjuvant formulation and characterize its mechanism of action providing a promising avenue for development of early life vaccines against RSV and other respiratory viral pathogens.",Respiratory syncytial virus is a major pathogen with burden observed and associated with childhood infection. Here the authors characterise a cationic adjuvant formulation and show single immunisation results in protection in a murine neonate model of respiratory syncytial virus infection.,2022-08-02
1021,Highly efficient and selective extraction of gold by reduced graphene oxide,"Materials capable of extracting gold from complex sources, especially electronic waste (e-waste), are needed for gold resource sustainability and effective e-waste recycling. However, it remains challenging to achieve high extraction capacity and precise selectivity if only a trace amount of gold is present along with other metallic elements . Here we report an approach based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) which provides an ultrahigh capacity and selective extraction of gold ions present in ppm concentrations (>1000 mg of gold per gram of rGO at 1 ppm). The excellent gold extraction performance is accounted to the graphene areas and oxidized regions of rGO. The graphene areas spontaneously reduce gold ions to metallic gold, and the oxidized regions allow good dispersibility of the rGO material so that efficient adsorption and reduction of gold ions at the graphene areas can be realized. By controlling the protonation of the oxidized regions of rGO, gold can be extracted exclusively, without contamination by the other 14 co-existing elements typically present in e-waste. These findings are further exploited to demonstrate recycling gold from real-world e-waste with good scalability and economic viability, as exemplified by using rGO membranes in a continuous flow-through process.","High extraction capacity with precise selectivity to trace amounts of gold over a wide range of co-existing elements remains a challenge for effective e-waste recycling. Here, authors demonstrate the excellent performance of rGO for gold extraction from e-waste leachate, even at minute concentrations.",2022-08-02
1022,Segregated cation flux by TPC2 biases Ca2+ signaling through lysosomes,"Two-pore channels are endo-lysosomal cation channels with malleable selectivity filters that drive endocytic ion flux and membrane traffic. Here we show that TPC2 can differentially regulate its cation permeability when co-activated by its endogenous ligands, NAADP and PI(3,5)P2. Whereas NAADP rendered the channel Ca2+-permeable and PI(3,5)P2 rendered the channel Na+-selective, a combination of the two increased Ca2+ but not Na+ flux. Mechanistically, this was due to an increase in Ca2+ permeability independent of changes in ion selectivity. Functionally, we show that cell permeable NAADP and PI(3,5)P2 mimetics synergistically activate native TPC2 channels in live cells, globalizing cytosolic Ca2+ signals and regulating lysosomal pH and motility. Our data reveal that flux of different ions through the same pore can be independently controlled and identify TPC2 as a likely coincidence detector that optimizes lysosomal Ca2+ signaling.","TPC2 is a lysosomal ion channel permeable to both calcium and sodium ions. Here, the authors show that TPC2 can selectively increase its calcium permeability when simultaneously challenged by both its natural activators- NAADP and PI(3,5)P2.",2022-08-02
1023,Sources of dehydration fluids underneath the Kamchatka arc,"Fluids mediate the transport of subducted slab material and play a crucial role in the generation of arc magmas. However, the source of subduction-derived fluids remains debated. The Kamchatka arc is an ideal subduction zone to identify the source of fluids because the arc magmas are comparably mafic, their source appears to be essentially free of subducted sediment-derived components, and subducted Hawaii-Emperor Seamount Chain (HESC) is thought to contribute a substantial fluid flux to the Kamchatka magmas. Here we show that Tl isotope ratios are unique tracers of HESC contribution to Kamchatka arc magma sources. In conjunction with trace element ratios and literature data, we trace the progressive dehydration and melting of subducted HESC across the Kamchatka arc. In succession, serpentine (<100 km depth), lawsonite (100–250 km depth) and phengite (>250 km depth) break down and produce fluids that contribute to arc magmatism at the Eastern Volcanic Front (EVF), Central Kamchatka Depression (CKD), and Sredinny Ridge (SR), respectively. However, given the Tl-poor nature of serpentine and lawsonite fluids, simultaneous melting of subducted HESC is required to explain the HESC-like Tl isotope signatures observed in EVF and CKD lavas. In the absence of eclogitic crust melting processes in this region of the Kamchatka arc, we propose that progressive dehydration and melting of a HESC-dominated mélange offers the most compelling interpretation of the combined isotope and trace element data.",Fluids released from progressive breakdown of minerals at increasing pressure within a mélange may explain the trace element systematics and stable thallium isotope data of the Kamchatka arc lavas from volcanic front to back arc.,2022-08-02
1024,Small-world complex network generation on a digital quantum processor,"Quantum cellular automata (QCA) evolve qubits in a quantum circuit depending only on the states of their neighborhoods and model how rich physical complexity can emerge from a simple set of underlying dynamical rules. The inability of classical computers to simulate large quantum systems hinders the elucidation of quantum cellular automata, but quantum computers offer an ideal simulation platform. Here, we experimentally realize QCA on a digital quantum processor, simulating a one-dimensional Goldilocks rule on chains of up to 23 superconducting qubits. We calculate calibrated and error-mitigated population dynamics and complex network measures, which indicate the formation of small-world mutual information networks. These networks decohere at fixed circuit depth independent of system size, the largest of which corresponding to 1,056 two-qubit gates. Such computations may enable the employment of QCA in applications like the simulation of strongly-correlated matter or beyond-classical computational demonstrations.","The study of complexity in quantum systems is a fascinating topic, which however is still in its infancy, especially at the experimental level. Here, the authors report on the observation of “small-world” characteristics in the network of quantum correlations within chains of up to 23 superconducting qubits long.",2022-08-02
1025,Fundamental investigations on the sodium-ion transport properties of mixed polyanion solid-state battery electrolytes,"Lithium and sodium (Na) mixed polyanion solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries display some of the highest ionic conductivities reported to date. However, the effect of polyanion mixing on the ion-transport properties is still not fully understood. Here, we focus on Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) NASICON electrolyte to elucidate the role of polyanion mixing on the Na-ion transport properties. Although NASICON is a widely investigated system, transport properties derived from experiments or theory vary by orders of magnitude. We use more than 2000 distinct ab initio-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to map the compositional space of NASICON over various time ranges, spatial resolutions and temperatures. Via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements on samples with different sodium content, we find that the highest ionic conductivity (i.e., about 0.165 S cm–1 at 473 K) is experimentally achieved in Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12, in line with simulations (i.e., about 0.170 S cm–1 at 473 K). The theoretical studies indicate that doped NASICON compounds (especially those with a silicon content x ≥ 2.4) can improve the Na-ion mobility compared to undoped NASICON compositions.","Battery solid-state electrolytes rely on mixed polyanion networks to attain high ionic conductivities. Here, the authors investigate the effect of polyanion mixing on the solid-state electrolyte ion conductivity via theoretical calculations and electrochemical measurements.",2022-08-02
1026,Engineering micro oxygen factories to slow tumour progression via hyperoxic microenvironments,"While hypoxia promotes carcinogenesis, tumour aggressiveness, metastasis, and resistance to oncological treatments, the impacts of hyperoxia on tumours are rarely explored because providing a long-lasting oxygen supply in vivo is a major challenge. Herein, we construct micro oxygen factories, namely, photosynthesis microcapsules (PMCs), by encapsulation of acquired cyanobacteria and upconversion nanoparticles in alginate microcapsules. This system enables a long-lasting oxygen supply through the conversion of external radiation into red-wavelength emissions for photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. PMC treatment suppresses the NF-kB pathway, HIF-1α production and cancer cell proliferation. Hyperoxic microenvironment created by an in vivo PMC implant inhibits hepatocarcinoma growth and metastasis and has synergistic effects together with anti-PD-1 in breast cancer. The engineering oxygen factories offer potential for tumour biology studies in hyperoxic microenvironments and inspire the exploration of oncological treatments.","Tumour hypoxia is an important factor in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy. Here, the authors present a micro oxygenation factory, capable of providing an oxygen supply through photosynthesis, and demonstrate its utility in cancer therapy.",2022-08-02
1027,Genomic architecture of adaptive radiation and hybridization in Alpine whitefish,"Adaptive radiations represent some of the most remarkable explosions of diversification across the tree of life. However, the constraints to rapid diversification and how they are sometimes overcome, particularly the relative roles of genetic architecture and hybridization, remain unclear. Here, we address these questions in the Alpine whitefish radiation, using a whole-genome dataset that includes multiple individuals of each of the 22 species belonging to six ecologically distinct ecomorph classes across several lake-systems. We reveal that repeated ecological and morphological diversification along a common environmental axis is associated with both genome-wide allele frequency shifts and a specific, larger effect, locus, associated with the gene edar. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of introgression between species from different lake-systems in facilitating the evolution and persistence of species with unique trait combinations and ecology. These results highlight the importance of both genome architecture and secondary contact with hybridization in fuelling adaptive radiation.","In this genomic study on Alpine whitefish radiations, the authors reveal details on the genetic architecture underlying the repeated eco-morphological diversification and the role of hybridization in the evolution of endemic whitefish species.",2022-08-02
1028,Transcriptomic diversity in human medullary thymic epithelial cells,"The induction of central T cell tolerance in the thymus depends on the presentation of peripheral self-epitopes by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). This promiscuous gene expression (pGE) drives mTEC transcriptomic diversity, with non-canonical transcript initiation, alternative splicing, and expression of endogenous retroelements (EREs) representing important but incompletely understood contributors. Here we map the expression of genome-wide transcripts in immature and mature human mTECs using high-throughput 5’ cap and RNA sequencing. Both mTEC populations show high splicing entropy, potentially driven by the expression of peripheral splicing factors. During mTEC maturation, rates of global transcript mis-initiation increase and EREs enriched in long terminal repeat retrotransposons are up-regulated, the latter often found in proximity to differentially expressed genes. As a resource, we provide an interactive public interface for exploring mTEC transcriptomic diversity. Our findings therefore help construct a map of transcriptomic diversity in the healthy human thymus and may ultimately facilitate the identification of those epitopes which contribute to autoimmunity and immune recognition of tumor antigens.","The thymus generates all T cells, including those that underly autoimmune diseases. Here, using deep sequencing, the authors profile human medullary thymic epithelial cells and establish a web portal to query their transcriptome, which may serve as a tool to help identify the drivers of autoimmunity.",2022-08-02
1029,Iron mobilization during lactation reduces oxygen stores in a diving mammal,"The profound impacts that maternal provisioning of finite energy resources has on offspring survival have been extensively studied across mammals. This study shows that in addition to calories, high hemoprotein concentrations in diving mammals necessitates exceptional female-to-pup iron transfer. Numerous indices of iron mobilization (ferritin, serum iron, total-iron-binding-capacity, transferrin saturation) were significantly elevated during lactation in adult female Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii), but not in skip-breeders. Iron was mobilized from endogenous stores for incorporation into the Weddell seal’s milk at concentrations up to 100× higher than terrestrial mammals. Such high rates of iron offload to offspring drew from the female’s own heme stores and led to compromised physiologic dive capacities (hemoglobin, myoglobin, and total body oxygen stores) after weaning their pups, which was further reflected in shorter dive durations. We demonstrate that lactational iron transfer shapes physiologic dive thresholds, identifying a cost of reproduction to a marine mammal.","Here, the authors show that Weddell seal mothers mobilize endogenous iron stores during lactation to provide to pups, resulting in iron concentrations in milk 100x higher than terrestrial mammals. This was associated with reduced dive durations in the mother, a cost of reproduction.",2022-08-02
1030,Search performance and octopamine neuronal signaling mediate parasitoid induced changes in Drosophila oviposition behavior,"Making the appropriate responses to predation risk is essential for the survival of an organism; however, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we find that Drosophila has evolved an adaptive strategy to manage the threat from its parasitoid wasp by manipulating the oviposition behavior. Through perception of the differences in host search performance of wasps, Drosophila is able to recognize younger wasps as a higher level of threat and consequently depress the oviposition. We further show that this antiparasitoid behavior is mediated by the regulation of the expression of Tdc2 and Tβh in the ventral nerve cord via LC4 visual projection neurons, which in turn leads to the dramatic reduction in octopamine and the resulting dysfunction of mature follicle trimming and rupture. Our study uncovers a detailed mechanism underlying the defensive behavior in insects that may advance our understanding of predator avoidance in animals.","Animals have evolved varied strategies for predator avoidance. Here the authors find that Drosophila can recognize threats from younger parasitoid wasps via the perception of their search performance, and reduce egg laying through the reduction of octopamine neuronal signalling.",2022-08-02
1031,A common deletion at BAK1 reduces enhancer activity and confers risk of intracranial germ cell tumors,"Intracranial germ cell tumors (IGCTs) are rare brain neoplasms that mainly occur in children and adolescents with a particularly high incidence in East Asian populations. Here, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 133 patients with IGCTs and 762 controls of Japanese ancestry. A common 4-bp deletion polymorphism in an enhancer adjacent to BAK1 is significantly associated with the disease risk (rs3831846; P = 2.4 × 10−9, odds ratio = 2.46 [95% CI: 1.83–3.31], minor allele frequency = 0.43). Rs3831846 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with a testicular GCTs susceptibility variant rs210138. In-vitro reporter assays reveal rs3831846 to be a functional variant attenuating the enhancer activity, suggesting its contribution to IGCTs predisposition through altering BAK1 expression. Risk alleles of testicular GCTs derived from the European GWAS show significant positive correlations in the effect sizes with the Japanese IGCTs GWAS (P = 1.3 × 10−4, Spearman’s ρ = 0.48). These results suggest the shared genetic susceptibility of GCTs beyond ethnicity and primary sites.","Intracranial germ cell tumors (IGCTs) are rare brain tumors mainly diagnosed in children and young adults. Here, the authors conduct a genome-wide association study for IGCTs, identify a risk locus at BAK1, and characterize its functional consequences.",2022-08-02
1032,Steering the multiexciton generation in slip-stacked perylene dye array via exciton coupling,"Dye arrays from dimers up to larger oligomers constitute the functional units of natural light harvesting systems as well as organic photonic and photovoltaic materials. Whilst in the past decades many photophysical studies were devoted to molecular dimers for deriving structure-property relationship to unravel the design principles for ideal optoelectronic materials, they fail to accomplish the subsequent processes of charge carrier generation or the detachment of two triplet species in singlet fission (SF). Here, we present a slip-stacked perylene bisimide trimer, which constitutes a bridge between hitherto studied dimer and solid-state materials, to investigate SF mechanisms. This work showcases multiple pathways towards the multiexciton state through direct or excimer-mediated mechanisms by depending upon interchromophoric interaction. These results suggest the comprehensive role of the exciton coupling, exciton delocalization, and excimer state to facilitate the SF process. In this regard, our observations expand the fundamental understanding the structure-property relationship in dye arrays.","Understanding structure-property relationship of dye arrays is of great importance for designing organic photonic and photovoltaic materials. Here, authors present a slip-stacked perylene bisimide array as a model system to investigate singlet fission mechanisms by depending upon interchromophoric interaction.",2022-08-02
1033,Golgi stress induces SIRT2 to counteract Shigella infection via defatty-acylation,"Enzymes from pathogens often modulate host protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), facilitating survival and proliferation of pathogens. Shigella virulence factors IpaJ and IcsB induce proteolytic cleavage and lysine fatty acylation on host proteins, which cause Golgi stress and suppress innate immunity, respectively. However, it is unknown whether host enzymes could reverse such modifications introduced by pathogens’ virulence factors to suppress pathogenesis. Herein, we report that SIRT2, a potent lysine defatty-acylase, is upregulated by the transcription factor CREB3 under Golgi stress induced by Shigella infection. SIRT2 in turn removes the lysine fatty acylation introduced by Shigella virulence factor IcsB to enhance host innate immunity. SIRT2 knockout mice are more susceptible to Shigella infection than wildtype mice, demonstrating the importance of SIRT2 to counteract Shigella infection.","Here the authors revealed a role for the protein deacetylase SIRT2 in Golgi stress, particularly induced by bacterial infection. Shigella secrete effector proteins such as IcsB, which transfers fatty acyl groups to modify host proteins to evade host immune surveillance. The upregulated SIRT2 counteracts this function by removing the fatty acyl groups and enhancing the killing of Shigella.",2022-08-02

Here we take the first steps to extend this to human cells demonstrating exceptional base editing to convert TAG to TAA for 33 essential genes via a single transfection, and examine base-editing genome-wide (observing ~40 C-to-T off-target events in essential gene exons). We also introduce GRIT, a computational tool for recoding. This demonstrates the feasibility of recoding, and highly multiplex editing in mammalian cells.","Whole-genome recoding has been shown to enable nonstandard amino acids, biocontainment and viral resistance in bacteria. Here the authors extend this to human cells using base editing to convert TAG to TAA for 33 essential genes via a single transfection followed by examining base-editing genome-wide.",2022-08-02
1035,Comprehensive genomic and epigenomic analysis in cancer of unknown primary guides molecularly-informed therapies despite heterogeneity,"The benefit of molecularly-informed therapies in cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is unclear. Here, we use comprehensive molecular characterization by whole genome/exome, transcriptome and methylome analysis in 70 CUP patients to reveal substantial mutational heterogeneity with TP53, MUC16, KRAS, LRP1B and CSMD3 being the most frequently mutated known cancer-related genes. The most common fusion partner is FGFR2, the most common focal homozygous deletion affects CDKN2A. 56/70 (80%) patients receive genomics-based treatment recommendations which are applied in 20/56 (36%) cases. Transcriptome and methylome data provide evidence for the underlying entity in 62/70 (89%) cases. Germline analysis reveals five (likely) pathogenic mutations in five patients. Recommended off-label therapies translate into a mean PFS ratio of 3.6 with a median PFS1 of 2.9 months (17 patients) and a median PFS2 of 7.8 months (20 patients). Our data emphasize the clinical value of molecular analysis and underline the need for innovative, mechanism-based clinical trials.","The identification of molecular biomarkers in cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) cases may enable the improvement of prognosis in these patients.

1036,Coherent helicity-dependent spin-phonon oscillations in the ferromagnetic van der Waals crystal CrI3,"The discovery of two-dimensional systems hosting intrinsic magnetic order represents a seminal addition to the rich landscape of van der Waals materials. CrI3 is an archetypal example, where the interdependence of structure and magnetism, along with strong light-matter interactions, provides a new platform to explore the optical control of magnetic and vibrational degrees of freedom at the nanoscale. However, the nature of magneto-structural coupling on its intrinsic ultrafast timescale remains a crucial open question. Here, we probe magnetic and vibrational dynamics in bulk CrI3 using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, revealing spin-flip scattering-driven demagnetization and strong transient exchange-mediated interactions between lattice vibrations and spin oscillations. The latter yields a coherent spin-coupled phonon mode that is highly sensitive to the driving pulse’s helicity in the magnetically ordered phase. Our results elucidate the nature of ultrafast spin-lattice coupling in CrI3 and highlight its potential for applications requiring high-speed control of magnetism at the nanoscale.","CrI3 is a van der Waals material which exhibits magnetic ordering down to the monolayer limit. Here, using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, Padmanabhan and Buessen et al. investigate the coupling between the magnetically ordered spins and lattice distortions, finding a coherent spin-coupled phonon mode.",2022-08-02
1037,Zika vector competence data reveals risks of outbreaks: the contribution of the European ZIKAlliance project,"First identified in 1947, Zika virus took roughly 70 years to cause a pandemic unusually associated with virus-induced brain damage in newborns. Zika virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti, and secondarily, Aedes albopictus, both colonizing a large strip encompassing tropical and temperate regions. As part of the international project ZIKAlliance initiated in 2016, 50 mosquito populations from six species collected in 12 countries were experimentally infected with different Zika viruses. Here, we show that Ae. aegypti is mainly responsible for Zika virus transmission having the highest susceptibility to viral infections. Other species play a secondary role in transmission while Culex mosquitoes are largely non-susceptible. Zika strain is expected to significantly modulate transmission efficiency with African strains being more likely to cause an outbreak. As the distribution of Ae. aegypti will doubtless expand with climate change and without new marketed vaccines, all the ingredients are in place to relive a new pandemic of Zika.","Zika virus (ZIKV), the causative agent of virus-induced brain damage in newborns, is transmitted by mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti, and secondarily, Aedes albopictus. Here, Obadia et al. characterize ZIKV vector competence of 50 mosquito populations from six species collected in 12 different countries to inform about epidemic risk. They find that African ZIKV strain shows higher transmission efficiency compared to American and Asian ZIKV strains and that Ae. aegypti mosquitoes have highest susceptibility to infections, while Culexmosquitoes are largely non-susceptible.",2022-08-02
1038,Systematic strategies for developing phage resistant Escherichia coli strains,"Phages are regarded as powerful antagonists of bacteria, especially in industrial fermentation processes involving bacteria. While bacteria have developed various defense mechanisms, most of which are effective against a narrow range of phages and consequently exert limited protection from phage infection. Here, we report a strategy for developing phage-resistant Escherichia coli strains through the simultaneous genomic integration of a DNA phosphorothioation-based Ssp defense module and mutations of components essential for the phage life cycle. The engineered E. coli strains show strong resistance against diverse phages tested without affecting cell growth. Additionally, the resultant engineered phage-resistant strains maintain the capabilities of producing example recombinant proteins, D-amino acid oxidase and coronavirus-encoded nonstructural protein nsp8, even under high levels of phage cocktail challenge. The strategy reported here will be useful for developing engineered E. coli strains with improved phage resistance for various industrial fermentation processes for producing recombinant proteins and chemicals of interest.","Phage contamination is a persistent problem in industrial biotechnology processes employing bacterial strains.

1039,Flexible-type ultrathin holographic endoscope for microscopic imaging of unstained biological tissues,"Ultrathin lensless fibre endoscopes offer minimally invasive investigation, but they mostly operate as a rigid type due to the need for prior calibration of a fibre probe. Furthermore, most implementations work in fluorescence mode rather than label-free imaging mode, making them unsuitable for general medical diagnosis. Herein, we report a fully flexible ultrathin fibre endoscope taking 3D holographic images of unstained tissues with 0.85-μm spatial resolution. Using a bare fibre bundle as thin as 200-μm diameter, we design a lensless Fourier holographic imaging configuration to selectively detect weak reflections from biological tissues, a critical step for label-free endoscopic reflectance imaging. A unique algorithm is developed for calibration-free holographic image reconstruction, allowing us to image through a narrow and curved passage regardless of fibre bending. We demonstrate endoscopic reflectance imaging of unstained rat intestine tissues that are completely invisible to conventional endoscopes. The proposed endoscope will expedite a more accurate and earlier diagnosis than before with minimal complications.","Lensless fibre endoscopes are minimally invasive, but are often rigid and require calibration and fluorescence labelling.

1040,Spatiotemporal control of engineered bacteria to express interferon-γ by focused ultrasound for tumor immunotherapy,"Bacteria-based tumor therapy has recently attracted wide attentions due to its unique capability in targeting tumors and preferentially colonizing the core area of the tumor. Various therapeutic genes are also harbored into these engineering bacteria to enhance their anti-tumor efficacy. However, it is difficult to spatiotemporally control the expression of these inserted genes in the tumor site. Here, we engineer an ultrasound-responsive bacterium (URB) which can induce the expression of exogenous genes in an ultrasound-controllable manner. Owing to the advantage of ultrasound in tissue penetration, an acoustic remote control of bacterial gene expression can be realized by designing a temperature-actuated genetic switch. Cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ), an important immune regulatory molecule that plays a significant role in tumor immunotherapy, is used to test the system. Our results show that brief hyperthermia induced by focused ultrasound promotes the expression of IFN-γ gene, improving anti-tumor efficacy of URB in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides an alternative strategy for bacteria-mediated tumor immunotherapy.","Several approaches have been recently proposed to engineer bacteria for cancer immunotherapy. Here the authors design an ultrasound-responsive bacterium for the controlled release of IFNy at the tumor site, promoting anti-tumor immune responses in preclinical models.",2022-08-02
1041,Ribosome impairment regulates intestinal stem cell identity via ZAKɑ activation,"The small intestine is a rapidly proliferating organ that is maintained by a small population of Lgr5-expressing intestinal stem cells (ISCs). However, several Lgr5-negative ISC populations have been identified, and this remarkable plasticity allows the intestine to rapidly respond to both the local environment and to damage. However, the mediators of such plasticity are still largely unknown. Using intestinal organoids and mouse models, we show that upon ribosome impairment (driven by Rptor deletion, amino acid starvation, or low dose cyclohexamide treatment) ISCs gain an Lgr5-negative, fetal-like identity. This is accompanied by a rewiring of metabolism. Our findings suggest that the ribosome can act as a sensor of nutrient availability, allowing ISCs to respond to the local nutrient environment. Mechanistically, we show that this phenotype requires the activation of ZAKɑ, which in turn activates YAP, via SRC. Together, our data reveals a central role for ribosome dynamics in intestinal stem cells, and identify the activation of ZAKɑ as a critical mediator of stem cell identity.",Intestinal stem cells are responsible for replenishing cells within the high-turnover intestinal epithelium. Here they show that ribosome dynamics affect intestinal stem cell identity through a mechanism that is triggered by changes in nutrient availability.,2022-08-02
1042,Distinctive roles of translesion polymerases DinB1 and DnaE2 in diversification of the mycobacterial genome through substitution and frameshift mutagenesis,"Antibiotic resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is exclusively a consequence of chromosomal mutations. Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a widely conserved mechanism of DNA damage tolerance and mutagenesis, executed by translesion polymerases such as DinBs. In mycobacteria, DnaE2 is the only known agent of TLS and the role of DinB polymerases is unknown. Here we demonstrate that, when overexpressed, DinB1 promotes missense mutations conferring resistance to rifampicin, with a mutational signature distinct from that of DnaE2, and abets insertion and deletion frameshift mutagenesis in homo-oligonucleotide runs. DinB1 is the primary mediator of spontaneous −1 frameshift mutations in homo-oligonucleotide runs whereas DnaE2 and DinBs are redundant in DNA damage-induced −1 frameshift mutagenesis. These results highlight DinB1 and DnaE2 as drivers of mycobacterial genome diversification with relevance to antimicrobial resistance and host adaptation.","This manuscript elucidates new mechanisms of mutagenesis in mycobacteria by implicating two translesion DNA polymerases in genome diversification, including creating the mutations that underlie all antibiotic resistance in these global pathogens.",2022-08-02
1043,A conflict between spatial selection and evidence accumulation in area LIP,"The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) contains spatially selective neurons that help guide eye movements and, according to numerous studies, do so by accumulating sensory evidence in favor of one choice (e.g., look left) or another (look right). To examine this functional link, we trained two monkeys on an urgent motion discrimination task, a task with which the evolution of both the recorded neuronal activity and the subject’s choice can be tracked millisecond by millisecond. We found that while choice accuracy increased steeply with increasing sensory evidence, at the same time, the LIP selection signal became progressively weaker, as if it hindered performance. This effect was consistent with the transient deployment of spatial attention to disparate locations away from the relevant sensory cue. The results demonstrate that spatial selection in LIP is dissociable from, and may even conflict with, evidence accumulation during informed saccadic choices.","In primate area LIP, target selection and the accumulation of sensory evidence are considered a single process. Here, the authors use urgent choice tasks to show that spatial selection in LIP is distinct from, and may even conflict with, evidence accumulation.",2022-08-01
1044,Photochemical spin-state control of binding configuration for tailoring organic color center emission in carbon nanotubes,"Incorporating fluorescent quantum defects in the sidewalls of semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) through chemical reaction is an emerging route to predictably modify nanotube electronic structures and develop advanced photonic functionality. Applications such as room-temperature single-photon emission and high-contrast bio-imaging have been advanced through aryl-functionalized SWCNTs, in which the binding configurations of the aryl group define the energies of the emitting states. However, the chemistry of binding with atomic precision at the single-bond level and tunable control over the binding configurations are yet to be achieved. Here, we explore recently reported photosynthetic protocol and find that it can control chemical binding configurations of quantum defects, which are often referred to as organic color centers, through the spin multiplicity of photoexcited intermediates. Specifically, photoexcited aromatics react with SWCNT sidewalls to undergo a singlet-state pathway in the presence of dissolved oxygen, leading to ortho binding configurations of the aryl group on the nanotube. In contrast, the oxygen-free photoreaction activates previously inaccessible para configurations through a triplet-state mechanism. These experimental results are corroborated by first principles simulations. Such spin-selective photochemistry diversifies SWCNT emission tunability by controlling the morphology of the emitting sites.","Chemical functionalization of the sidewalls of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is an emerging route to introduce fluorescent quantum defects and tailor the emission properties.

1045,Efficient perpendicular magnetization switching by a magnetic spin Hall effect in a noncollinear antiferromagnet,"Current induced spin-orbit torques driven by the conventional spin Hall effect are widely used to manipulate the magnetization. This approach, however, is nondeterministic and inefficient for the switching of magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy that are demanded by the high-density magnetic storage and memory devices. Here, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by exploiting a magnetic spin Hall effect in noncollinear antiferromagnets, such as Mn3Sn. The magnetic group symmetry of Mn3Sn allows generation of the out-of-plane spin current carrying spin polarization collinear to its direction induced by an in-plane charge current. This spin current drives an out-of-plane anti-damping torque providing the deterministic switching of the perpendicular magnetization of an adjacent Ni/Co multilayer. Due to being odd with respect to time reversal symmetry, the observed magnetic spin Hall effect and the resulting spin-orbit torque can be reversed with reversal of the antiferromagnetic order. Contrary to the conventional spin-orbit torque devices, the demonstrated magnetization switching does not need an external magnetic field and requires much lower current density which is useful for low-power spintronics.","Spin-orbit torques driven by the conventional spin Hall effect are widely used to switch magnetization, but this approach is nondeterministic and inefficient for magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Here, the authors demonstrate deterministic, field-free switching in a Ni/Co multilayer by exploiting the magnetic spin Hall effect in adjacent Mn3Sn.",2022-08-01
1046,Stable solar water splitting with wettable organic-layer-protected silicon photocathodes,"Protective layers are essential for Si-based photocathodes to achieve long-term stability. The conventionally used inorganic protective layers, such as TiO2, need to be free of pinholes to isolate Si from corrosive solution, which demands extremely high-quality deposition techniques. On the other hand, organic hydrophobic protective layers suffer from the trade-off between current density and stability. This paper describes the design and fabrication of a discontinuous hybrid organic protective layer with controllable surface wettability. The underlying hydrophobic layer induces the formation of thin gas layers at the discontinuous pores to isolate the electrolyte from Si substrate, while allowing Pt co-catalyst to contact the electrolyte for water splitting. Meanwhile, the surface of this organic layer is modified with hydrophilic hydroxyl groups to facilitate bubble detachment. The optimized photocathode achieves a stable photocurrent of 35 mA/cm2 for over 110 h with no trend of decay.","Preparation of inorganic protective layers for photoelectrodes requires high-quality deposition techniques. Here, the authors report a spin-coated organic protective layer that enables Si photocathodes to realize stable solar water splitting.",2022-08-01
1047,The receptor kinase SRF3 coordinates iron-level and flagellin dependent defense and growth responses in plants,"Iron is critical for host–pathogen interactions. While pathogens seek to scavenge iron to spread, the host aims at decreasing iron availability to reduce pathogen virulence. Thus, iron sensing and homeostasis are of particular importance to prevent host infection and part of nutritional immunity. While the link between iron homeostasis and immunity pathways is well established in plants, how iron levels are sensed and integrated with immune response pathways remains unknown. Here we report a receptor kinase SRF3, with a role in coordinating root growth, iron homeostasis and immunity pathways via regulation of callose synthases. These processes are modulated by iron levels and rely on SRF3 extracellular and kinase domains which tune its accumulation and partitioning at the cell surface. Mimicking bacterial elicitation with the flagellin peptide flg22 phenocopies SRF3 regulation upon low iron levels and subsequent SRF3-dependent responses. We propose that SRF3 is part of nutritional immunity responses involved in sensing external iron levels.","Iron homeostasis is known to influence plant immune signaling. Here the authors characterize SRF3, a receptor kinase that acts as a negative regulator of callose synthesis, that is required for root responses to iron deficiency and pathogen signals.",2022-08-01

In this observational cohort study, we determine the risk of breakthrough infection in a fully vaccinated cohort. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG levels were measured before first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and at day 21–28, 90 and 180, as well as after booster vaccination. Breakthrough infections were captured through the Danish National Microbiology database. incidence rate ratio (IRR) for breakthrough infection at time-updated anti-spike IgG levels was determined using Poisson regression. Among 6076 participants, 127 and 364 breakthrough infections due to Delta and Omicron variants were observed. IRR was 0.29 (95% CI 0.15–0.56) for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant, comparing the highest and lowest quintiles of anti-spike IgG. For Omicron, no significant differences in IRR were observed. These results suggest that quantitative level of anti-spike IgG have limited impact on the risk of breakthrough infection with Omicron.","The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is associated with high rates of vaccine breakthrough infections, but the immunological basis for this is not well characterised. Here, the authors show that increased anti-Spike IgG antibody levels are associated with a reduced risk of infection with the Delta variant, but not with Omicron.",2022-08-01
1049,Xist exerts gene-specific silencing during XCI maintenance and impacts lineage-specific cell differentiation and proliferation during hematopoiesis,"X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a dosage compensation phenomenon that occurs in females. Initiation of XCI depends on Xist RNA, which triggers silencing of one of the two X chromosomes, except for XCI escape genes that continue to be biallelically expressed. In the soma XCI is stably maintained with continuous Xist expression. How Xist impacts XCI maintenance remains an open question. Here we conditionally delete Xist in hematopoietic system of mice and report differentiation and cell cycle defects in female hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). By utilizing female HSPCs and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we find that X-linked genes show variable tolerance to Xist loss. Specifically, XCI escape genes exhibit preferential transcriptional upregulation, which associates with low H3K27me3 occupancy and high chromatin accessibility that accommodates preexisting binding of transcription factors such as Yin Yang 1 (YY1) at the basal state. We conclude that Xist is necessary for gene-specific silencing during XCI maintenance and impacts lineage-specific cell differentiation and proliferation during hematopoiesis.","Here the authors investigate the functional relevance of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) regulator Xist in hematopoiesis. They find that Xist loss leads to changes in the ratio of hematopoietic progenitor cells and results in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional upregulation on the inactive X chromosome, including XCI escape genes known to be associated with cell cycle and immune response.",2022-08-01
1050,Global analysis and prediction of fluoride in groundwater,"The health of millions of people worldwide is negatively impacted by chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of geogenic fluoride in groundwater. Due to health effects including dental mottling and skeletal fluorosis, the World Health Organization maintains a maximum guideline of 1.5 mg/L in drinking water. As groundwater quality is not regularly tested in many areas, it is often unknown if the water in a given well or spring contains harmful levels of fluoride. Here we present a state-of-the-art global fluoride hazard map based on machine learning and over 400,000 fluoride measurements (10% of which >1.5 mg/L), which is then used to estimate the human population at risk. Hotspots indicated by the groundwater fluoride hazard map include parts of central Australia, western North America, eastern Brazil and many areas of Africa and Asia. Of the approximately 180 million people potentially affected worldwide, most reside in Asia (51–59% of total) and Africa (37–46% of total), with the latter representing 6.5% of the continent’s population. Africa also contains 14 of the top 20 affected countries in terms of population at risk. We also illuminate and discuss the key globally relevant hydrochemical and environmental factors related to fluoride accumulation.","A global fluoride hazard prediction map was created using machine learning and over 400,000 fluoride measurements, this shows ~180 million people are potentially affected by chronic fluoride exposure worldwide, mostly in Asia and Africa.",2022-08-01
1051,Visible-light mediated catalytic asymmetric radical deuteration at non-benzylic positions,"Site- and enantioselective incorporation of deuterium into organic compounds is of broad interest in organic synthesis, especially within the pharmaceutical industry. While catalytic approaches relying on two-electron reaction manifolds have allowed for stereoselective delivery of a formal deuteride (D–) or deuteron (D+) at benzylic positions, complementary strategies that make use of one-electron deuterium atom transfer and target non-benzylic positions remain elusive. Here we report a photochemical approach for asymmetric radical deuteration by utilizing readily available peptide- or sugar-derived thiols as the catalyst and inexpensive deuterium oxide as the deuterium source. This metal-free platform enables four types of deuterofunctionalization reactions of exocyclic olefins and allows deuteration at non-benzylic positions with high levels of enantioselectivity and deuterium incorporation. Computational studies reveal that attractive non-covalent interactions are responsible for stereocontrol. We anticipate that our findings will open up new avenues for asymmetric deuteration.","Catalytic asymmetric deuterations rely largely on two-electron reaction manifolds and are mostly limited to benzylic positions. Here, a metal-free platform using peptide- or sugar-derived chiral thiols and deuterium oxide allows for asymmetric open-shell deuteration at non-benzylic positions under visible-light irradiation.",2022-08-01
1052,Adaptive wireless millirobotic locomotion into distal vasculature,"Microcatheters have enabled diverse minimally invasive endovascular operations and notable health benefits compared with open surgeries. However, with tortuous routes far from the arterial puncture site, the distal vascular regions remain challenging for safe catheter access. Therefore, we propose a wireless stent-shaped magnetic soft robot to be deployed, actively navigated, used for medical functions, and retrieved in the example M4 segment of the middle cerebral artery. We investigate shape-adaptively controlled locomotion in phantoms emulating the physiological conditions here, where the lumen diameter shrinks from 1.5 mm to 1 mm, the radius of curvature of the tortuous lumen gets as small as 3 mm, the lumen bifurcation angle goes up to 120°, and the pulsatile flow speed reaches up to 26 cm/s. The robot can also withstand the flow when the magnetic actuation is turned off. These locomotion capabilities are confirmed in porcine arteries ex vivo. Furthermore, variants of the robot could release the tissue plasminogen activator on-demand locally for thrombolysis and function as flow diverters, initiating promising therapies towards acute ischemic stroke, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, dural arteriovenous fistulas, and brain tumors. These functions should facilitate the robot’s usage in new distal endovascular operations.","Accessibility into the distal vascular systems to treat various diseases remains challenging using medical catheters. Here, Wang et al. demonstrate that a stent-shaped wireless magnetic soft robot enables adaptive locomotion and medical functions into these distal vascular regions.",2022-08-01
1053,Breast cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles promote CD8+ T cell exhaustion via TGF-β type II receptor signaling,"Cancer immunotherapies have shown clinical success in various types of tumors but the patient response rate is low, particularly in breast cancer. Here we report that malignant breast cancer cells can transfer active TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) via tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEV) and thereby stimulate TGF-β signaling in recipient cells. Up-take of extracellular vesicle-TβRII (EV-TβRII) in low-grade tumor cells initiates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thus reinforcing cancer stemness and increasing metastasis in intracardial xenograft and orthotopic transplantation models. EV-TβRII delivered as cargo to CD8+ T cells induces the activation of SMAD3 which we demonstrated to associate and cooperate with TCF1 transcription factor to impose CD8+ T cell exhaustion, resulting in failure of immunotherapy. The levels of TβRII+ circulating extracellular vesicles (crEV) appears to correlate with tumor burden, metastasis and patient survival, thereby serve as a non-invasive screening tool to detect malignant breast tumor stages. Thus, our findings not only identify a possible mechanism by which breast cancer cells can promote T cell exhaustion and dampen host anti-tumor immunity, but may also identify a target for immune therapy against the most devastating breast tumors.","Understanding the factors that hamper immune therapy in breast cancer may increase the range of patients who benefit. Here authors show that breast cancer cells produce and subsequently transfer active TGF-β type II receptors to CD8 + T cells to render them exhausted, thus paralyzing the anti-tumor immune response.",2022-08-01
1054,Combined comparative genomics and clinical modeling reveals plasmid-encoded genes are independently associated with Klebsiella infection,"Members of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex frequently colonize the gut and colonization is associated with subsequent infection. To identify genes associated with progression from colonization to infection, we undertook a case-control comparative genomics study. Concordant cases (N = 85), where colonizing and invasive isolates were identical strain types, were matched to asymptomatically colonizing controls (N = 160). Thirty-seven genes are associated with infection, 27 of which remain significant following adjustment for patient variables and bacterial phylogeny. Infection-associated genes are not previously characterized virulence factors, but instead a diverse group of stress resistance, regulatory and antibiotic resistance genes, despite careful adjustment for antibiotic exposure. Many genes are plasmid borne, and for some, the relationship with infection is mediated by gut dominance. Five genes were validated in a geographically-independent cohort of colonized patients. This study identifies several genes reproducibly associated with progression to infection in patients colonized by diverse Klebsiella.","Patient variables, such as comorbidities, partially explain which patients will progress to Klebsiella infection, with colonization of the gut acting as a reservoir. Little is known, however, regarding Klebsiella genes that may increase risk of disease in colonized individuals. Here, authors conduct a comparative genomics study to identify genes associated with progression from colonisation to infection.",2022-08-01
1055,Tuning lower dimensional superconductivity with hybridization at a superconducting-semiconducting interface,"The influence of interface electronic structure is vital to control lower dimensional superconductivity and its applications to gated superconducting electronics, and superconducting layered heterostructures. Lower dimensional superconductors are typically synthesized on insulating substrates to reduce interfacial driven effects that destroy superconductivity and delocalize the confined wavefunction. Here, we demonstrate that the hybrid electronic structure formed at the interface between a lead film and a semiconducting and highly anisotropic black phosphorus substrate significantly renormalizes the superconductivity in the lead film. Using ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we characterize the renormalization of lead’s quantum well states, its superconducting gap, and its vortex structure which show strong anisotropic characteristics. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the renormalization of superconductivity is driven by hybridization at the interface which modifies the confinement potential and imprints the anisotropic characteristics of the semiconductor substrate on selected regions of the Fermi surface of lead. Using an analytical model, we link the modulated superconductivity to an anisotropy that selectively tunes the superconducting order parameter in reciprocal space. These results illustrate that interfacial hybridization can be used to tune superconductivity in quantum technologies based on lower dimensional superconducting electronics.","Lower-dimensional superconductors are typically synthesized on insulating substrates. Here, the authors find that the hybrid electronic structure formed at the interface between a lead film and a semiconducting black phosphorus substrate significantly renormalizes the superconductivity in the lead film.",2022-08-01
1056,"Coupled influence of tectonics, climate, and surface processes on landscape evolution in southwestern North America","The Cenozoic landscape evolution in southwestern North America is ascribed to crustal isostasy, dynamic topography, or lithosphere tectonics, but their relative contributions remain controversial. Here we reconstruct landscape history since the late Eocene by investigating the interplay between mantle convection, lithosphere dynamics, climate, and surface processes using fully coupled four-dimensional numerical models. Our quantified depth-dependent strain rate and stress history within the lithosphere, under the influence of gravitational collapse and sub-lithospheric mantle flow, show that high gravitational potential energy of a mountain chain relative to a lower Colorado Plateau can explain extension directions and stress magnitudes in the belt of metamorphic core complexes during topographic collapse. Profound lithospheric weakening through heating and partial melting, following slab rollback, promoted this extensional collapse. Landscape evolution guided northeast drainage onto the Colorado Plateau during the late Eocene-late Oligocene, south-southwest drainage reversal during the late Oligocene-middle Miocene, and southwest drainage following the late Miocene.","Cenozoic landscape evolution of southwestern North America remains debated. Here, the authors reconstruct landscape using 4-D numerical models, which can explain extensional collapse and superficial geological record for the Basin and Range Province",2022-08-01
1057,Molecular and in vivo studies of a glutamate-class prolyl-endopeptidase for coeliac disease therapy,"The digestion of gluten generates toxic peptides, among which a highly immunogenic proline-rich 33-mer from wheat α-gliadin, that trigger coeliac disease. Neprosin from the pitcher plant is a reported prolyl endopeptidase. Here, we produce recombinant neprosin and its mutants, and find that full-length neprosin is a zymogen, which is self-activated at gastric pH by the release of an all-β pro-domain via a pH-switch mechanism featuring a lysine plug. The catalytic domain is an atypical 7+8-stranded β-sandwich with an extended active-site cleft containing an unprecedented pair of catalytic glutamates. Neprosin efficiently degrades both gliadin and the 33-mer in vitro under gastric conditions and is reversibly inactivated at pH > 5. Moreover, co-administration of gliadin and the neprosin zymogen at the ratio 500:1 reduces the abundance of the 33-mer in the small intestine of mice by up to 90%. Neprosin therefore founds a family of eukaryotic glutamate endopeptidases that fulfils requisites for a therapeutic glutenase.","Celiac disease is characterized by intolerance to gluten, a cereal protein. Here, the authors show that neprosin, a glutamate peptidase from the pitcher plant, efficiently cleaves gluten components under physiological conditions in vitro and in the gut of mice.",2022-08-01
1058,Frequency wavelength multiplexed optoacoustic tomography,"Optoacoustics (OA) is overwhelmingly implemented in the Time Domain (TD) to achieve high signal-to-noise ratios by maximizing the excitation light energy transient. Implementations in the Frequency Domain (FD) have been proposed, but suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios and have not offered competitive advantages over time domain methods to reach high dissemination. It is therefore commonly believed that TD is the optimal way to perform optoacoustics. Here we introduce an optoacoustic concept based on pulse train illumination and frequency domain multiplexing and theoretically demonstrate the superior merits of the approach compared to the time domain. Then, using recent advances in laser diode illumination, we launch Frequency Wavelength Multiplexing Optoacoustic Tomography (FWMOT), at multiple wavelengths, and experimentally showcase how FWMOT optimizes the signal-to-noise ratios of spectral measurements over time-domain methods in phantoms and in vivo. We further find that FWMOT offers the fastest multi-spectral operation ever demonstrated in optoacoustics.",Optoacoustic imaging is mostly performed in the time domain. Here the authors demonstrate frequency wavelength multiplexed optoacoustic tomography that can operate at multiple wavelengths simultaneously and offers signal-to-noise ratio advantages over time domain methods.,2022-08-01
1059,Aβ42 oligomers trigger synaptic loss through CAMKK2-AMPK-dependent effectors coordinating mitochondrial fission and mitophagy,"During the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in both mouse models and human patients, soluble forms of Amyloid-β 1–42 oligomers (Aβ42o) trigger loss of excitatory synapses (synaptotoxicity) in cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons (PNs) prior to the formation of insoluble amyloid plaques. In a transgenic AD mouse model, we observed a spatially restricted structural remodeling of mitochondria in the apical tufts of CA1 PNs dendrites corresponding to the dendritic domain where the earliest synaptic loss is detected in vivo. We also observed AMPK over-activation as well as increased fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial biomass in Ngn2-induced neurons derived from a new APPSwe/Swe knockin human ES cell line. We demonstrate that Aβ42o-dependent over-activation of the CAMKK2-AMPK kinase dyad mediates synaptic loss through coordinated phosphorylation of MFF-dependent mitochondrial fission and ULK2-dependent mitophagy. Our results uncover a unifying stress-response pathway causally linking Aβ42o-dependent structural remodeling of dendritic mitochondria to synaptic loss.",Loss of excitatory synapses occur prior to the formation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease. Here the authors show in an animal model that the loss of synapses induced by amyloid-beta oligomers requires over-activation of a stress-response pathway inducing structural remodelling of mitochondria in dendrites of cortical and hippocampal neurons.,2022-08-01
1060,Highly conserved shifts in ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) activity drive mitochondrial remodeling during quiescence,"Defects in cellular proteostasis and mitochondrial function drive many aspects of infertility, cancer, and other age-related diseases. All of these conditions rely on quiescent cells, such as oocytes and adult stem cells, that reduce their activity and remain dormant as part of their roles in tissue homeostasis, reproduction, and even cancer recurrence. Using a multi-organism approach, we show that dynamic shifts in the ubiquitin proteasome system drive mitochondrial remodeling during cellular quiescence. In contrast to the commonly held view that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is primarily regulated by substrate ubiquitination, we find that increasing proteasome number and their recruitment to mitochondria support mitochondrial respiratory quiescence (MRQ). GSK3 triggers proteasome recruitment to the mitochondria by phosphorylating outer membrane proteins, such as VDAC, and suppressing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. This work defines a process that couples dynamic regulation of UPS activity to coordinated shifts in mitochondrial metabolism in fungi, Drosophila, and mammals during quiescence.","Dynamic regulation of cellular proteostasis is linked to the metabolic state of quiescent cells in vivo. Here, the authors show, in multiple organisms, that shifts in the ubiquitin-proteome system are coupled to mitochondrial metabolic changes and subsequent respiratory quiescence.",2022-08-01
1061,High-fidelity photonic quantum logic gate based on near-optimal Rydberg single-photon source,"Compared to other types of qubits, photon is one of a kind due to its unparalleled advantages in long-distance quantum information exchange. Therefore, photon is a natural candidate for building a large-scale, modular optical quantum computer operating at room temperature. However, low-fidelity two-photon quantum logic gates and their probabilistic nature result in a large resource overhead for fault tolerant quantum computation. While the probabilistic problem can, in principle, be solved by employing multiplexing and error correction, the fidelity of linear-optical quantum logic gate is limited by the imperfections of single photons. Here, we report the demonstration of a linear-optical quantum logic gate with truth table fidelity of 99.84(3)% and entangling gate fidelity of 99.69(4)% post-selected upon the detection of photons. The achieved high gate fidelities are made possible by our near-optimal Rydberg single-photon source. Our work paves the way for scalable photonic quantum applications based on near-optimal single-photon qubits and photon-photon gates.","The current main source of errors for photonic quantum logic gates is the imperfections of the single photons. Here, by using high-quality photons from Rydberg atoms, the authors are able to reach 99.7% entangling gate fidelity in a photonic CNOT gate.",2022-08-01
1062,ROR2 regulates self-renewal and maintenance of hair follicle stem cells,"Hair follicles undergo cycles of regeneration fueled by hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). While β-catenin-dependent canonical Wnt signaling has been extensively studied and implicated in HFSC activation and fate determination, very little is known about the function of β-catenin-independent Wnt signaling in HFSCs. In this study, we investigate the functional role of ROR2, a Wnt receptor, in HFSCs. By analyzing Ror2-depleted HFSCs, we uncover that ROR2 is not only essential to regulate Wnt-activated signaling that is responsible for HFSC activation and self-renewal, but it is also required to maintain proper ATM/ATR-dependent DNA damage response, which is indispensable for the long-term maintenance of HFSCs. In analyzing HFSCs lacking β-catenin, we identify a compensatory role of ROR2-PKC signaling in protecting β-catenin-null HFSCs from the loss of stem cell pool. Collectively, our study unveils a previously unrecognized role of ROR2 in regulation of stem cell self-renewal and maintenance.","Wnt signaling functions in tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. Here the authors show that ROR2, a Wnt receptor, plays roles not only in transducing Wnt signaling, but also in regulation of DNA damage response critical for stem cell maintenance.",2022-08-01
1063,Real-time 3D analysis during electron tomography using tomviz,"The demand for high-throughput electron tomography is rapidly increasing in biological and material sciences. However, this 3D imaging technique is computationally bottlenecked by alignment and reconstruction which runs from hours to days. We demonstrate real-time tomography with dynamic 3D tomographic visualization to enable rapid interpretation of specimen structure immediately as data is collected on an electron microscope. Using geometrically complex chiral nanoparticles, we show volumetric interpretation can begin in less than 10 minutes and a high-quality tomogram is available within 30 minutes. Real-time tomography is integrated into tomviz, an open-source and cross-platform 3D data analysis tool that contains intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUI), to enable any scientist to characterize biological and material structure in 3D.","High-throughput electron tomography has been challenging due to time-consuming alignment and reconstruction. Here, the authors demonstrate real-time tomography with dynamic 3D tomographic visualization integrated in tomviz, an open-source 3D data analysis tool.",2022-08-01
1064,Combi-seq for multiplexed transcriptome-based profiling of drug combinations using deterministic barcoding in single-cell droplets,"Anti-cancer therapies often exhibit only short-term effects. Tumors typically develop drug resistance causing relapses that might be tackled with drug combinations. Identification of the right combination is challenging and would benefit from high-content, high-throughput combinatorial screens directly on patient biopsies. However, such screens require a large amount of material, normally not available from patients. To address these challenges, we present a scalable microfluidic workflow, called Combi-Seq, to screen hundreds of drug combinations in picoliter-size droplets using transcriptome changes as a readout for drug effects. We devise a deterministic combinatorial DNA barcoding approach to encode treatment conditions, enabling the gene expression-based readout of drug effects in a highly multiplexed fashion. We apply Combi-Seq to screen the effect of 420 drug combinations on the transcriptome of K562 cells using only ~250 single cell droplets per condition, to successfully predict synergistic and antagonistic drug pairs, as well as their pathway activities.","Current screens to assess tumour drug resistance require a large amount of material, normally not available from patients.

1065,Germanium silicon oxide achieves multi-coloured ultra-long phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence at high temperature,"Colour-tuned phosphors are promising for advanced security applications such as multi-modal anti-counterfeiting and data encryption. The practical adoption of colour-tuned phosphors requires these materials to be responsive to multiple stimuli (e.g., excitation wavelength, excitation waveform, and temperature) and exhibit excellent materials stability simultaneously. Here we report germanium silicon oxide (GSO) – a heavy-metal-free inorganic phosphor – that exhibits colour-tuned ultra-long phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence across a broad temperature range (300 – 500 K) in air. We developed a sol-gel processing strategy to prepare amorphous oxides containing homogeneously dispersed Si and Ge atoms. The co-existence of Ge and Si luminescent centres (LC) leads to an excitation-dependent luminescence change across the UV-to-visible region. GSO exhibits Si LC-related ultra-long phosphorescence at room-temperature and thermally activated delayed fluorescence at temperatures as high as 573 K. This long-lived PL is sensitized via the energy transfer from Ge defects to Si LCs, which provides PL lifetime tunability for GSO phosphors. The oxide scaffold of GSO offers 500-day materials stability in air; and 1-week stability in strong acidic and basic solutions. Using GSO/polymer hybrids, we demonstrated colour-tuned security tags whose emission wavelength and lifetime can be controlled via the excitation wavelength, and temperature, indicating promise in security applications.","Advanced security applications require materials responsive to different stimuli with remarkable stability. Here, Sargent et al. introduce Ge homogenously into a silica scaffold and obtain a colourtuned germanium silicon oxide with ultra-long phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence across a broad temperature range.",2022-08-01
1066,"1,2-Amino oxygenation of alkenes with hydrogen evolution reaction","1,2-Amino oxygenation of alkenes has emerged as one of the most straightforward synthetic methods to produce β-amino alcohols, which are important organic building blocks. Thus, a practical synthetic strategy for 1,2-amino oxygenation is highly desirable. Here, we reported an electro-oxidative intermolecular 1,2-amino oxygenation of alkenes with hydrogen evolution, removing the requirement of extra-oxidant. Using commercial oxygen and nitrogen sources as starting materials, this method provides a cheap, scalable, and efficient route to a set of valuable β-amino alcohol derivatives. Moreover, the merit of this protocol has been exhibited by its broad substrate scope and good application in continuous-flow reactors. Furthermore, this method can be extended to other amino-functionalization of alkenes, thereby showing the potential to inspire advances in applications of electro-induced N-centered radicals (NCRs).","1,2-Aminoxygenation of alkenes without extra oxidant is a practical yet challenging way to prepare β-amino alcohols. Here, the authors report an electro-oxidative route achieving such a goal with H2 evolution, exhibiting broad scope and application potential.",2022-07-30
1067,Direct force measurement of microscopic droplets pulled along soft surfaces,"When a droplet is placed on a soft surface, surface tension deforms the substrate, creating a capillary ridge. We study how the motion of the ridge dissipates energy in microscopic droplets. Using a micropipette based method, we are able to simultaneously image and measure forces on a microscopic droplet moving at a constant speed along a soft film supported on a rigid substrate. Changing the thickness of the thin film tunes the effective stiffness of the substrate. Thus we can control the ridge size without altering the surface chemistry. We find that the dissipation depends strongly on the film thickness, decreasing monotonically as effective stiffness increases. This monotonic trend is beyond the realm of small deformation theory, but can be explained with a simple scaling analysis.","Elastic deformation of soft substrates occurs upon wetting, yet it is challenging to follow its dynamics at a microscale. Khattak et al. show that the force required to pull a droplet along a soft surface decreases monotonically as the film thickness decreases and explain the phenomenon using a scaling analysis.",2022-07-30
1068,Unexpected steric hindrance failure in the gas phase F− + (CH3)3CI SN2 reaction,"Base-induced elimination (E2) and bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reactions are of significant importance in physical organic chemistry. The textbook example of the retardation of SN2 reactivity by bulky alkyl substitution is widely accepted based on the static analysis of molecular structure and steric environment. However, the direct dynamical evidence of the steric hindrance of SN2 from experiment or theory remains rare. Here, we report an unprecedented full-dimensional (39-dimensional) machine learning-based potential energy surface for the 15-atom F− + (CH3)3CI reaction, facilitating the reliable and efficient reaction dynamics simulations that can reproduce well the experimental outcomes and examine associated atomic-molecular level mechanisms. Moreover, we found surprisingly high “intrinsic” reactivity of SN2 when the E2 pathway is completely blocked, indicating the reaction that intends to proceed via E2 transits to SN2 instead, due to a shared pre-reaction minimum. This finding indicates that the competing factor of E2 but not the steric hindrance determines the small reactivity of SN2 for the F− + (CH3)3CI reaction. Our study provides new insight into the dynamical origin that determines the intrinsic reactivity in gas-phase organic chemistry.","Base-induced elimination (E2) and bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) are of significant importance in physical organic chemistry. Here, the authors show that the competing factor of E2 as opposed to steric hindrance determines the low reactivity of SN2 in the F− + (CH3)3CI reaction.",2022-07-30
1069,CDC-like kinase 4 deficiency contributes to pathological cardiac hypertrophy by modulating NEXN phosphorylation,"Kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation plays a crucial role in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we show that CDC-like kinase 4 (CLK4) is a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and heart failure. Knockdown of Clk4 leads to pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, while overexpression of Clk4 confers resistance to phenylephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Cardiac-specific Clk4-knockout mice manifest pathological myocardial hypertrophy with progressive left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart dilation. Further investigation identifies nexilin (NEXN) as the direct substrate of CLK4, and overexpression of a phosphorylation-mimic mutant of NEXN is sufficient to reverse the hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes induced by Clk4 knockdown. Importantly, restoring phosphorylation of NEXN ameliorates myocardial hypertrophy in mice with cardiac-specific Clk4 deletion. We conclude that CLK4 regulates cardiac function through phosphorylation of NEXN, and its deficiency may lead to pathological cardiac hypertrophy. CLK4 is a potential intervention target for the prevention and treatment of heart failure.",Phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases is a key event in signaling pathways involved in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Here the authors show that the kinase CLK4 ameliorates cardiac hypertrophy by phosphorylating NEXN.,2022-07-30
1070,Evaluation of transplacental transfer of mRNA vaccine products and functional antibodies during pregnancy and infancy,"Studies are needed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy, and the levels of protection provided to their newborns through placental transfer of antibodies. Here, we evaluate the transplacental transfer of mRNA vaccine products and functional anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during pregnancy and early infancy in a cohort of 20 individuals vaccinated during late pregnancy. We find no evidence of mRNA vaccine products in maternal blood, placenta tissue, or cord blood at delivery. However, we find time-dependent efficient transfer of IgG and neutralizing antibodies to the neonate that persists during early infancy. Additionally, using phage immunoprecipitation sequencing, we find a vaccine-specific signature of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein epitope binding that is transplacentally transferred during pregnancy. Timing of vaccination during pregnancy is critical to ensure transplacental transfer of protective antibodies during early infancy.","Pregnant individuals are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2-related morbidity and mortality, yet more studies are needed to evaluate safety and efficacy of vaccination during pregnancy, and also the level of protection provided to the newborn.

1071,RNA-binding protein RBM3 intrinsically suppresses lung innate lymphoid cell activation and inflammation partially through CysLT1R,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) promote lung inflammation in asthma through cytokine production. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical post-transcriptional regulators, although less is known about RBPs in ILC biology. Here, we demonstrate that RNA-binding motif 3 (RBM3) is highly expressed in lung ILCs and is further induced by alarmins TSLP and IL-33. Rbm3−/− and Rbm3−/−Rag2−/− mice exposed to asthma-associated Alternaria allergen develop enhanced eosinophilic lung inflammation and ILC activation. IL-33 stimulation studies in vivo and in vitro show that RBM3 suppressed lung ILC responses. Further, Rbm3−/− ILCs from bone marrow chimeric mice display increased ILC cytokine production suggesting an ILC-intrinsic suppressive function of RBM3. RNA-sequencing of Rbm3−/− lung ILCs demonstrates increased expression of type 2/17 cytokines and cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor (CysLT1R). Finally, Rbm3−/−Cyslt1r−/− mice show dependence on CysLT1R for accumulation of ST2+IL-17+ ILCs. Thus, RBM3 intrinsically regulates lung ILCs during allergen-induced type 2 inflammation that is partially dependent on CysLT1R.",The function of RNA binding proteins within innate lymphoid cells (ILC) has been partially characterised. Here the authors show that RBM3 functions to limit the type 2 immunity promoting activity of ILC2 partially through cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor.,2022-07-30
1072,Structural basis for assembly and disassembly of the IGF/IGFBP/ALS ternary complex,"Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have pleiotropic roles in embryonic and postnatal growth and differentiation. Most serum IGFs are bound in a ternary complex with IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and acid-labile subunit (ALS), extending the serum half-life of IGFs and regulating their availability. Here, we report cryo-EM structure of the human IGF1/IGFBP3/ALS ternary complex, revealing the detailed architecture of a parachute-like ternary complex and crucial determinants for their sequential and specific assembly. In vitro biochemical studies show that proteolysis at the central linker domain of IGFBP3 induces release of its C-terminal domain rather than IGF1 release from the ternary complex, yielding an intermediate complex that enhances IGF1 bioavailability. Our results provide mechanistic insight into IGF/IGFBP3/ALS ternary complex assembly and its disassembly upon proteolysis for IGF bioavailability, suggesting a structural basis for human diseases associated with IGF1 and IGFALS gene mutations such as complete ALS deficiency (ACLSD) and IGF1 deficiency.","Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) regulates growth and differentiation.

1073,Maladaptive positive feedback production of ChREBPβ underlies glucotoxic β-cell failure,"Preservation and expansion of β-cell mass is a therapeutic goal for diabetes. Here we show that the hyperactive isoform of carbohydrate response-element binding protein (ChREBPβ) is a nuclear effector of hyperglycemic stress occurring in β-cells in response to prolonged glucose exposure, high-fat diet, and diabetes. We show that transient positive feedback induction of ChREBPβ is necessary for adaptive β-cell expansion in response to metabolic challenges. Conversely, chronic excessive β-cell-specific overexpression of ChREBPβ results in loss of β-cell identity, apoptosis, loss of β-cell mass, and diabetes. Furthermore, β-cell “glucolipotoxicity” can be prevented by deletion of ChREBPβ. Moreover, ChREBPβ-mediated cell death is mitigated by overexpression of the alternate CHREBP gene product, ChREBPα, or by activation of the antioxidant Nrf2 pathway in rodent and human β-cells. We conclude that ChREBPβ, whether adaptive or maladaptive, is an important determinant of β-cell fate and a potential target for the preservation of β-cell mass in diabetes.","ChREBP is a glucose-responsive transcription factor, which regulates glucose-mediated proliferation and cell death in pancreatic β-cells. Here the authors show that the acute feed forward induction of ChREBPβ is required for adaptive β-cell expansion, that chronic overexpression of ChREBPβ is toxic to β-cells, and offer mitigation strategies",2022-07-30
1074,A practical concept for catalytic carbonylations using carbon dioxide,"The rise of CO2 in atmosphere is considered as the major reason for global warming. Therefore, CO2 utilization has attracted more and more attention. Among those, using CO2 as C1-feedstock for the chemical industry provides a solution. Here we show a two-step cascade process to perform catalytic carbonylations of olefins, alkynes, and aryl halides utilizing CO2 and H2. For the first step, a novel heterogeneous copper 10Cu@SiO2-PHM catalyst exhibits high selectivity (≥98%) and decent conversion (27%) in generating CO from reducing CO2 with H2. The generated CO is directly utilized without further purification in industrially important carbonylation reactions: hydroformylation, alkoxycarbonylation, and aminocarbonylation. Notably, various aldehydes, (unsaturated) esters and amides are obtained in high yields and chemo-/regio-selectivities at low temperature under ambient pressure. Our approach is of interest for continuous syntheses in drug discovery and organic synthesis to produce building blocks on reasonable scale utilizing CO2.","Using CO2 as C1-feedstock for the chemical industry has attracted great attention. Here the authors develop a two-step cascade process to perform catalytic carbonylations of olefins, alkynes, and aryl halides using CO2 and H2.",2022-07-30
1075,Cholesterol sulfate alleviates ulcerative colitis by promoting cholesterol biosynthesis in colonic epithelial cells,"Cholesterol sulfate, produced by hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase 2B1 (SULT2B1), is highly abundant in the intestine. Herein, we study the functional role and underlying intestinal epithelial repair mechanisms of cholesterol sulfate in ulcerative colitis. The levels of cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate, as well as the expression of Sult2b1 and genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, are significantly higher in inflamed tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis than in intestinal mucosa from healthy controls. Cholesterol sulfate in the gut and circulation is mainly catalyzed by intestinal epithelial SULT2B1. Specific deletion of the Sult2b1 gene in the intestinal epithelial cells aggravates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis; however, dietary supplementation with cholesterol sulfate ameliorates this effect in acute and chronic ulcerative colitis in mice. Cholesterol sulfate promotes cholesterol biosynthesis by binding to Niemann-Pick type C2 protein and activating sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 in colonic epithelial cells, thereby alleviates ulcerative colitis. In conclusion, cholesterol sulfate contributes to the healing of the mucosal barrier and exhibits therapeutic efficacy against ulcerative colitis in mice.","New treatment strategies are required for ulcerative colitis. Here the authors show in mouse models that cholesterol sulfate, an endogenous active cholesterol derivative, contributes to the healing of the mucosal barrier by promoting cholesterol biosynthesis in colonic epithelial cells and exhibits therapeutic efficacy against ulcerative colitis.",2022-07-30
1076,Photochemical and thermochemical pathways to S2 and polysulfur formation in the atmosphere of Venus,"Polysulfur species have been proposed to be the unknown near-UV absorber in the atmosphere of Venus. Recent work argues that photolysis of one of the (SO)2 isomers, cis-OSSO, directly yields S2 with a branching ratio of about 10%. If correct, this pathway dominates polysulfur formation by several orders of magnitude, and by addition reactions yields significant quantities of S3, S4, and S8. We report here the results of high-level ab-initio quantum-chemistry computations that demonstrate that S2 is not a product in cis-OSSO photolysis. Instead, we establish a novel mechanism in which S2 is formed in a two-step process. Firstly, the intermediate S2O is produced by the coupling between the S and Cl atmospheric chemistries (in particular, SO reaction with ClS) and in a lesser extension by O-abstraction reactions from cis-OSSO. Secondly, S2O reacts with SO. This modified chemistry yields S2 and subsequent polysulfur abundances comparable to the photolytic cis-OSSO mechanism through a more plausible pathway. Ab initio quantification of the photodissociations at play fills a critical data void in current atmospheric models of Venus.","Polysulfur compounds have been ascribed as the unknown near-UV absorbers in Venusian atmosphere and play a key role in the sulfur chemical cycle of this planet. Here, authors establish their production from (SO)2 on the grounds of quantifications of photochemical and thermal pathways involved in the sulfur chemical cycle of the planet.",2022-07-30
1077,Evidence accumulation occurs locally in the parietal cortex,"Decision making often entails evidence accumulation, a process that is represented by neural activities in a network of multiple brain areas. Yet, it has not been identified where exactly the accumulation originates. We reason that a candidate brain area should both represent evidence accumulation and information that is used to compute evidence. Therefore, we designed a two-stage probabilistic reasoning task in which the evidence for accumulation had to be first determined from sensory signals orthogonal to decisions. With a linear encoding model, we decomposed the responses of posterior parietal neurons to each stimulus into an early and a late component that represented two dissociable stages of decision making. The former reflected the transformation from sensory inputs to accumulable evidence, and the latter reflected the accumulation of evidence and the formation of decisions. The presence of both computational stages indicates that evidence accumulation signal in the parietal cortex is computed locally.","The source of the evidence accumulation signal widely observed in the brain during decision making is unknown. Here, the authors used a two-stage decision task to show that the accumulation signal in the posterior parietal cortex arises locally.",2022-07-30
1078,Knowledge-graph-based cell-cell communication inference for spatially resolved transcriptomic data with SpaTalk,"Spatially resolved transcriptomics provides genetic information in space toward elucidation of the spatial architecture in intact organs and the spatially resolved cell-cell communications mediating tissue homeostasis, development, and disease. To facilitate inference of spatially resolved cell-cell communications, we here present SpaTalk, which relies on a graph network and knowledge graph to model and score the ligand-receptor-target signaling network between spatially proximal cells by dissecting cell-type composition through a non-negative linear model and spatial mapping between single-cell transcriptomic and spatially resolved transcriptomic data. The benchmarked performance of SpaTalk on public single-cell spatial transcriptomic datasets is superior to that of existing inference methods. Then we apply SpaTalk to STARmap, Slide-seq, and 10X Visium data, revealing the in-depth communicative mechanisms underlying normal and disease tissues with spatial structure. SpaTalk can uncover spatially resolved cell-cell communications for single-cell and spot-based spatially resolved transcriptomic data universally, providing valuable insights into spatial inter-cellular tissue dynamics.","Cell-cell communication is a vital feature involving numerous biological processes. Here, the authors develop SpaTalk, a cell-cell communication inference method using knowledge graph for spatially resolved transcriptomic data, providing valuable insights into spatial intercellular tissue dynamics.",2022-07-30
1079,Structure-guided and phage-assisted evolution of a therapeutic anti-EGFR antibody to reverse acquired resistance,"Acquired resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancers is partially mediated by the acquisition of mutations located in the cetuximab epitope in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ectodomain and hinders the clinical application of cetuximab. We develop a structure-guided and phage-assisted evolution approach for cetuximab evolution to reverse EGFRS492R- or EGFRG465R-driven resistance without altering the binding epitope or undermining antibody efficacy. Two evolved cetuximab variants, Ctx-VY and Ctx-Y104D, exhibit a restored binding ability with EGFRS492R, which harbors the most common resistance substitution, S492R. Ctx-W52D exhibits restored binding with EGFR harboring another common cetuximab resistance substitution, G465R (EGFRG465R). All the evolved cetuximab variants effectively inhibit EGFR activation and downstream signaling and induce the internalization and degradation of EGFRS492R and EGFRG465R as well as EGFRWT. The evolved cetuximab variants (Ctx-VY, Ctx-Y104D and Ctx-W52D) with one or two amino acid substitutions in the complementarity-determining region inherit the optimized physical and chemical properties of cetuximab to a great extent, thus ensuring their druggability. Our data collectively show that structure-guided and phage-assisted evolution is an efficient and general approach for reversing receptor mutation-mediated resistance to therapeutic antibody drugs.",Acquired resistance to cetuximab can be mediated by generation of mutations in the EGFR ectodomain. Here the authors report a structure-guided and phage-assisted evolution approach for cetuximab evolution to reverse resistance without altering the binding epitope or undermining antibody efficacy.,2022-07-30
1080,Tropical cyclone-blackout-heatwave compound hazard resilience in a changing climate,"Tropical cyclones (TCs) have caused extensive power outages. The impacts of TC-caused blackouts may worsen in the future as TCs and heatwaves intensify. Here we couple TC and heatwave projections and power outage and recovery process analysis to investigate how TC-blackout-heatwave compound hazard risk may vary in a changing climate, with Harris County, Texas as an example. We find that, under the high-emissions scenario RCP8.5, long-duration heatwaves following strong TCs may increase sharply. The expected percentage of Harris residents experiencing at least one longer-than-5-day TC-blackout-heatwave compound hazard in a 20-year period could increase dramatically by a factor of 23 (from 0.8% to 18.2%) over the 21st century. We also reveal that a moderate enhancement of the power distribution network can significantly mitigate the compound hazard risk. Thus, climate adaptation actions, such as strategically undergrounding distribution network and developing distributed energy sources, are urgently needed to improve coastal power system resilience.","The study found that long-duration heatwaves are much more likely to follow power-damaging tropical cyclones in the future RCP8.5 climate, with the impact of longer-than-5-day tropical cyclone-blackout-heatwave compound hazard increasing by a factor of 23 over the 21st century.",2022-07-30
1081,Robust prediction of force chains in jammed solids using graph neural networks,"Force chains are quasi-linear self-organised structures carrying large stresses and are ubiquitous in jammed amorphous materials like granular materials, foams or even cell assemblies. Predicting where they will form upon deformation is crucial to describe the properties of such materials, but remains an open question. Here we demonstrate that graph neural networks (GNN) can accurately predict the location of force chains in both frictionless and frictional materials from the undeformed structure, without any additional information. The GNN prediction accuracy also proves to be robust to changes in packing fraction, mixture composition, amount of deformation, friction coefficient, system size, and the form of the interaction potential. By analysing the structure of the force chains, we identify the key features that affect prediction accuracy. Our results and methodology will be of interest for granular matter and disordered systems, e.g. in cases where direct force chain visualisation or force measurements are impossible.","The emergence of correlated and self-organized linear structures, known as force chains, is relevant for granular materials, foams, emulsions, and extreme active matter. The authors develop a machine learning-based approach to predict force chain formation in jammed disordered solids under deformation.",2022-07-30
1082,Organic covalent modification to improve thermoelectric properties of TaS2,"Organic semiconductors are attracting considerable attention as a new thermoelectric material because of their molecular diversity, non-toxicity and easy processing. The side chains which are introduced into two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) by covalent modification lead to a significant decrease in their thermal conductivity. Here, we describe a simple approach to preparing the side chains covalent modification TaS2 (SCCM-TaS2) organic/inorganic hybrid structures, which is a homogeneous and non-destructive technique that does not depend on defects and boundaries. Electrical conductivity of 3,401 S cm−1 and a power factor of 0.34 mW m−1 K−2 are obtained for a hybrid material of SCCM-TaS2, with an in-plane thermal conductivity of 4.0 W m−1 K−1, which is 7 times smaller than the thermal conductivity of the pristine TaS2 crystal. The power factor and low thermal conductivity contribute to a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of ~0.04 at 443 K.","The improvement of thermoelectric performance of materials by reducing lattice thermal conductivity is challenging. Here, the authors find the side chains covalent modification of transition metal disulfides reducing the lattice thermal conductivity.",2022-07-29
1083,CO-tolerant RuNi/TiO2 catalyst for the storage and purification of crude hydrogen,"Hydrogen storage by means of catalytic hydrogenation of suitable organic substrates helps to elevate the volumetric density of hydrogen energy. In this regard, utilizing cheaper industrial crude hydrogen to fulfill the goal of hydrogen storage would show economic attraction. However, because CO impurities in crude hydrogen can easily deactivate metal active sites even in trace amounts such a process has not yet been realized. Here, we develop a robust RuNi/TiO2 catalyst that enables the efficient hydrogenation of toluene to methyl-cyclohexane under simulated crude hydrogen feeds with 1000–5000 ppm CO impurity at around 180 °C under atmospheric pressure. We show that the co-localization of Ru and Ni species during reduction facilitated the formation of tightly coupled metallic Ru-Ni clusters. During the catalytic hydrogenation process, due to the distinct bonding properties, Ru and Ni served as the active sites for CO methanation and toluene hydrogenation respectively. Our work provides fresh insight into the effective utilization and purification of crude hydrogen for the future hydrogen economy.","Efficient storage of crude hydrogen, through toluene hydrogenation to methylcyclohexane, is often inhibited by CO impurities. Here, the authors develop a RuNi/TiO2 catalyst which avoids deactivation through promoting simultaneous CO methanation.",2022-07-29
1084,Mouse fetal growth restriction through parental and fetal immune gene variation and intercellular communications cascade,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) affects 5–10% of pregnancies, and can have serious consequences for both mother and child. Prevention and treatment are limited because FGR pathogenesis is poorly understood. Genetic studies implicate KIR and HLA genes in FGR, however, linkage disequilibrium, genetic influence from both parents, and challenges with investigating human pregnancies make the risk alleles and their functional effects difficult to map. Here, we demonstrate that the interaction between the maternal KIR2DL1, expressed on uterine natural killer (NK) cells, and the paternally inherited HLA-C*0501, expressed on fetal trophoblast cells, leads to FGR in a humanized mouse model. We show that the KIR2DL1 and C*0501 interaction leads to pathogenic uterine arterial remodeling and modulation of uterine NK cell function. This initial effect cascades to altered transcriptional expression and intercellular communication at the maternal-fetal interface. These findings provide mechanistic insight into specific FGR risk alleles, and provide avenues of prevention and treatment.","Natural Killer cells regulate foetal growth. Here the authors use a humanized transgenic mouse to demonstrate that specific HLA-C KIR2DL interactions promote changes in maternal and foetal cell transcriptomes, resulting in modifications to placental vasculature, intercellular communications and foetal growth restriction.",2022-07-29
1085,Pathogen-selective killing by guanylate-binding proteins as a molecular mechanism leading to inflammasome signaling,"Inflammasomes are cytosolic signaling complexes capable of sensing microbial ligands to trigger inflammation and cell death responses. Here, we show that guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) mediate pathogen-selective inflammasome activation. We show that mouse GBP1 and GBP3 are specifically required for inflammasome activation during infection with the cytosolic bacterium Francisella novicida. We show that the selectivity of mouse GBP1 and GBP3 derives from a region within the N-terminal domain containing charged and hydrophobic amino acids, which binds to and facilitates direct killing of F. novicida and Neisseria meningitidis, but not other bacteria or mammalian cells. This pathogen-selective recognition by this region of mouse GBP1 and GBP3 leads to pathogen membrane rupture and release of intracellular content for inflammasome sensing. Our results imply that GBPs discriminate between pathogens, confer activation of innate immunity, and provide a host-inspired roadmap for the design of synthetic antimicrobial peptides that may be of use against emerging and re-emerging pathogens.",Guanylate-binding proteins (GBP) have a function in inflammasome formation and pathogen defence. Here the authors show that these GBP proteins are able to kill certain bacteria and promote selective inflammasome activation and that this is mediated by specific GBP protein regions.,2022-07-29
1086,DNA methylation-based epigenetic signatures predict somatic genomic alterations in gliomas,"Molecular classification has improved diagnosis and treatment for patients with malignant gliomas. However, classification has relied on individual assays that are both costly and slow, leading to frequent delays in treatment. Here, we propose the use of DNA methylation, as an emerging clinical diagnostic platform, to classify gliomas based on major genomic alterations and provide insight into subtype characteristics. We show that using machine learning models, DNA methylation signatures can accurately predict somatic alterations and show improvement over existing classifiers. The established Unified Diagnostic Pipeline (UniD) we develop is rapid and cost-effective for genomic alterations and gene expression subtypes diagnostic at early clinical phase and improves over individual assays currently in clinical use. The significant relationship between genetic alteration and epigenetic signature indicates broad applicability of our approach to other malignancies.","No clinical assay currently exists to classify glioma tumours based on gene expression. Here, the authors develop a DNA methylation-based classifier, Unified Diagnostic Pipeline (UniD) that identifies genomic alterations and gene expression subtypes of gliomas.",2022-07-29
1087,Functional neuronal circuitry and oscillatory dynamics in human brain organoids,"Human brain organoids replicate much of the cellular diversity and developmental anatomy of the human brain. However, the physiology of neuronal circuits within organoids remains under-explored. With high-density CMOS microelectrode arrays and shank electrodes, we captured spontaneous extracellular activity from brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We inferred functional connectivity from spike timing, revealing a large number of weak connections within a skeleton of significantly fewer strong connections. A benzodiazepine increased the uniformity of firing patterns and decreased the relative fraction of weakly connected edges. Our analysis of the local field potential demonstrate that brain organoids contain neuronal assemblies of sufficient size and functional connectivity to co-activate and generate field potentials from their collective transmembrane currents that phase-lock to spiking activity. These results point to the potential of brain organoids for the study of neuropsychiatric diseases, drug action, and the effects of external stimuli upon neuronal networks.","Brain organoids replicate cellular organization found in the developing human brain. Here, the authors utilize microelectronics to map activity in brain organoids and assemble functional circuits that mirror complexity found in brain networks in vivo.",2022-07-29
1088,Cascaded dissipative DNAzyme-driven layered networks guide transient replication of coded-strands as gene models,"Dynamic, transient, out-of-equilibrium networks guide cellular genetic, metabolic or signaling processes. Designing synthetic networks emulating natural processes imposes important challenges including the ordered connectivity of transient reaction modules, engineering of the appropriate balance between production and depletion of reaction constituents, and coupling of the reaction modules with emerging chemical functions dictated by the networks. Here we introduce the assembly of three coupled reaction modules executing a cascaded dynamic process leading to the transient formation and depletion of three different Mg2+-ion-dependent DNAzymes. The transient operation of the DNAzyme in one layer triggers the dynamic activation of the DNAzyme in the subsequent layer, leading to a three-layer transient catalytic cascade. The kinetics of the transient cascade is computationally simulated. The cascaded network is coupled to a polymerization/nicking DNA machinery guiding transient synthesis of three coded strands acting as “gene models”, and to the rolling circle polymerization machinery leading to the transient synthesis of fluorescent Zn(II)-PPIX/G-quadruplex chains or hemin/G-quadruplex catalytic wires.",A reaction network executing a cascaded transient formation and depletion of three different catalytic strands is introduced. The system is coupled to the secondary temporal synthesis of different coded strands as gene models.,2022-07-29
1089,TRIM28-dependent SUMOylation protects the adult ovary from activation of the testicular pathway,"Gonadal sexual fate in mammals is determined during embryonic development and must be actively maintained in adulthood. In the mouse ovary, oestrogen receptors and FOXL2 protect ovarian granulosa cells from transdifferentiation into Sertoli cells, their testicular counterpart. However, the mechanism underlying their protective effect is unknown. Here, we show that TRIM28 is required to prevent female-to-male sex reversal of the mouse ovary after birth. We found that upon loss of Trim28, ovarian granulosa cells transdifferentiate to Sertoli cells through an intermediate cell type, different from gonadal embryonic progenitors. TRIM28 is recruited on chromatin in the proximity of FOXL2 to maintain the ovarian pathway and to repress testicular-specific genes. The role of TRIM28 in ovarian maintenance depends on its E3-SUMO ligase activity that regulates the sex-specific SUMOylation profile of ovarian-specific genes. Our study identifies TRIM28 as a key factor in protecting the adult ovary from the testicular pathway.","Gonadal fate in mammals is determined during embryogenesis and is actively maintained in adulthood. This study shows that E3-SUMO ligase activity of TRIM28 is required for ovarian identity maintenance and testicular-specific gene repression in mouse adult ovary; in its absence, ovarian granulosa cells transdifferentiate to Sertoli cells.",2022-07-29
1090,Ammonia for post-healing of formamidinium-based Perovskite films,"Solvents employed for perovskite film fabrication not only play important roles in dissolving the precursors but also participate in crystallization process. High boiling point aprotic solvents with O-donor ligands have been extensively studied, but the formation of a highly uniform halide perovskite film still requires the participation of additives or an additional step to accelerate the nucleation rate. The volatile aliphatic methylamine with both coordinating ligands and hydrogen protons as solvent or post-healing gas facilitates the process of methylamine-based perovskite films with high crystallinity, few defects, and easy large-scale fabrication as well. However, the attempt in formamidinium-containing perovskites is challenged heretofore. Here, we reveal that the degradation of formamidinium-containing perovskites in aliphatic amines environment results from the transimination reaction of formamidinium cation and aliphatic amines along with the formation of ammonia. Based on this mechanism, ammonia is selected as a post-healing gas for a highly uniform, compact formamidinium-based perovskite films. In particular, low temperature is proved to be crucial to enable formamidinium-based perovskite materials to absorb enough ammonia molecules and form a liquid intermediate state which is the key to eliminating voids in raw films. As a result, the champion perovskite solar cell based on ammonia post-healing achieves a power conversion efficiency of 23.21% with excellent reproducibility. Especially the module power conversion efficiency with 14 cm2 active area is over 20%. This ammonia post-healing treatment potentially makes it easier to upscale fabrication of highly efficient formamidinium-based devices.","Solvents used for perovskite film fabrication not only dissolve the precursors but also play a role in the crystallization process. Here, authors study the role of transamination reactions in the underlying degradation mechanism of formamidinium-containing perovskites in aliphatic amines environment.",2022-07-29
1091,Cross-validation of distance measurements in proteins by PELDOR/DEER and single-molecule FRET,"Pulsed electron-electron double resonance spectroscopy (PELDOR/DEER) and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy (smFRET) are frequently used to determine conformational changes, structural heterogeneity, and inter probe distances in biological macromolecules. They provide qualitative information that facilitates mechanistic understanding of biochemical processes and quantitative data for structural modelling. To provide a comprehensive comparison of the accuracy of PELDOR/DEER and smFRET, we use a library of double cysteine variants of four proteins that undergo large-scale conformational changes upon ligand binding. With either method, we use established standard experimental protocols and data analysis routines to determine inter-probe distances in the presence and absence of ligands. The results are compared to distance predictions from structural models. Despite an overall satisfying and similar distance accuracy, some inconsistencies are identified, which we attribute to the use of cryoprotectants for PELDOR/DEER and label-protein interactions for smFRET. This large-scale cross-validation of PELDOR/DEER and smFRET highlights the strengths, weaknesses, and synergies of these two important and complementary tools in integrative structural biology.",Pulsed electron-electron double resonance spectroscopy (PELDOR/DEER) and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy (smFRET) are used to determine conformational changes and probe distances in biological macromolecules. Here the authors compare the methods on a large set of samples.,2022-07-29
1092,Cloning southern corn rust resistant gene RppK and its cognate gene AvrRppK from Puccinia polysora,"Broad-spectrum resistance has great values for crop breeding. However, its mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we report the cloning of a maize NLR gene, RppK, for resistance against southern corn rust (SCR) and its cognate Avr gene, AvrRppK, from Puccinia polysora (the causal pathogen of SCR). The AvrRppK gene has no sequence variation in all examined isolates. It has high expression level during infection and can suppress pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Further, the introgression of RppK into maize inbred lines and hybrids enhances resistance against multiple isolates of P. polysora, thereby increasing yield in the presence of SCR. Together, we show that RppK is involved in resistance against multiple P. polysora isolates and it can recognize AvrRppK, which is broadly distributed and conserved in P. polysora isolates.","Southern corn rust (SCR) caused by Puccinia polysora is a major maize disease that can result in major yield loss. Here, the authors report the expression of a CC-NB-LRR type of R gene RppK results in SCR resistance in susceptible maize lines and it can recognize the effector AvrRppK produced by P. polysora.",2022-07-29
1093,SARS-CoV-2 VOC type and biological sex affect molnupiravir efficacy in severe COVID-19 dwarf hamster model,"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) have triggered infection waves. Oral antivirals such as molnupiravir promise to improve disease management, but efficacy against VOC delta was questioned and potency against omicron is unknown. This study evaluates molnupiravir against VOC in human airway epithelium organoids, ferrets, and a lethal Roborovski dwarf hamster model of severe COVID-19-like lung injury. VOC were equally inhibited by molnupiravir in cells and organoids. Treatment reduced shedding in ferrets and prevented transmission. Pathogenicity in dwarf hamsters was VOC-dependent and highest for delta, gamma, and omicron. All molnupiravir-treated dwarf hamsters survived, showing reduction in lung virus load from one (delta) to four (gamma) orders of magnitude. Treatment effect size varied in individual dwarf hamsters infected with omicron and was significant in males, but not females. The dwarf hamster model recapitulates mixed efficacy of molnupiravir in human trials and alerts that benefit must be reassessed in vivo as VOC evolve.","Molnupiravir was the first orally available SARS-CoV-2 antiviral approved for outpatient use against SARS-CoV-2, but its efficacy against variants of concern, especially delta, was questioned. Here the authors evaluate molnupiravir against variant of concern in numerous models, including human airway epithelium organoids, ferrets and Roborovski dwarf hamsters.",2022-07-29
1094,Pyro-catalysis for tooth whitening via oral temperature fluctuation,"Tooth whitening has recently become one of the most popular aesthetic dentistry procedures. Beyond classic hydrogen peroxide-based whitening agents, photo-catalysts and piezo-catalysts have been demonstrated for non-destructive on-demand tooth whitening. However, their usage has been challenged due to the relatively limited physical stimuli of light irradiation and ultrasonic mechanical vibration. To address this challenge, we report here a non-destructive and convenient tooth whitening strategy based on the pyro-catalysis effect, realized via ubiquitous oral motion-induced temperature fluctuations. Degradation of organic dyes via pyro-catalysis is performed under cooling/heating cycling to simulate natural temperature fluctuations associated with intake and speech. Teeth stained by habitual beverages and flavorings can be whitened by the pyroelectric particles-embedded hydrogel under a small surrounding temperature fluctuation. Furthermore, the pyro-catalysis-based tooth whitening procedure exhibits a therapeutic biosafety and sustainability. In view of the exemplary demonstration, the most prevalent oral temperature fluctuation will enable the pyro-catalysis-based tooth whitening strategy to have tremendous potential for practical applications.","Tooth whitening becoming a common cosmetic treatment has led to the development of catalytic whitening solutions. Here, the authors report upon a thermally triggered, pyrocatalytic, catalyst which can use temperature changes from normal oral activity to breakdown stains and whiten teeth.",2022-07-29
1095,Gata6+ resident peritoneal macrophages promote the growth of liver metastasis,"Emerging evidence suggests that resident macrophages within tissues are enablers of tumor growth. However, a second population of resident macrophages surrounds all visceral organs within the cavities and nothing is known about these GATA6+ large peritoneal macrophages (GLPMs) despite their ability to invade injured visceral organs by sensing danger signals. Here, we show that GLPMs invade growing metastases that breach the visceral mesothelium of the liver via the “find me signal”, ATP. Depleting GLPMs either by pharmacological or genetic tools, reduces metastases growth. Apoptotic bodies from tumor cells induces programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) upregulation on GLPMs which block CD8+ T cell function. Direct targeting of GLPMs by intraperitoneal but not intravenous administration of anti-PD-L1 reduces tumor growth. Thermal ablation of liver metastases recruits huge numbers of GLPMs and enables rapid regrowth of tumors. GLPMs contribute to metastatic growth and tumor recurrence.","GLPMs represent a population of fetal liver derived large peritoneal cavity Gata6+ macrophages, with the capacity to invade the tissues they surround. Here, in experimental colon cancer liver metastasis models, the authors show that GLPMs invade liver metastasis directly from the peritoneum, promoting liver metastases growth.",2022-07-29
1096,Neprilysins regulate muscle contraction and heart function via cleavage of SERCA-inhibitory micropeptides,"Muscle contraction depends on strictly controlled Ca2+ transients within myocytes. A major player maintaining these transients is the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, SERCA. Activity of SERCA is regulated by binding of micropeptides and impaired expression or function of these peptides results in cardiomyopathy. To date, it is not known how homeostasis or turnover of the micropeptides is regulated. Herein, we find that the Drosophila endopeptidase Neprilysin 4 hydrolyzes SERCA-inhibitory Sarcolamban peptides in membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby ensuring proper regulation of SERCA. Cleavage is necessary and sufficient to maintain homeostasis and function of the micropeptides. Analyses on human Neprilysin, sarcolipin, and ventricular cardiomyocytes indicates that the regulatory mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. By identifying a neprilysin as essential regulator of SERCA activity and Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiomyocytes, these data contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms that control muscle contraction and heart function in health and disease.","Muscle contraction depends on strictly controlled calcium transients within myocytes. Here, the authors show that the endopeptidase Neprilysin 4 represents an essential regulator of these transients and, consequently, of proper heart function.",2022-07-29
1097,Balanced gene dosage control rather than parental origin underpins genomic imprinting,"Mammalian parental imprinting represents an exquisite form of epigenetic control regulating the parent-specific monoallelic expression of genes in clusters. While imprinting perturbations are widely associated with developmental abnormalities, the intricate regional interplay between imprinted genes makes interpreting the contribution of gene dosage effects to phenotypes a challenging task. Using mouse models with distinct deletions in an intergenic region controlling imprinting across the Dlk1-Dio3 domain, we link changes in genetic and epigenetic states to allelic-expression and phenotypic outcome in vivo. This determined how hierarchical interactions between regulatory elements orchestrate robust parent-specific expression, with implications for non-imprinted gene regulation. Strikingly, flipping imprinting on the parental chromosomes by crossing genotypes of complete and partial intergenic element deletions rescues the lethality of each deletion on its own. Our work indicates that parental origin of an epigenetic state is irrelevant as long as appropriate balanced gene expression is established and maintained at imprinted loci.","Here the authors investigate whether for imprinted genes the parent-of-origin of the expressed allele or rather appropriate gene dosage is more important for normal development. Using the differentially methylated region of Dlk1-Dio3 gene involved in imprinting, they show that correct parent-of-origin imprinting pattern is secondary to balanced gene dosage.",2022-07-29
1098,Thermal control of the topological edge flow in nonlinear photonic lattices,"The chaotic evolution resulting from the interplay between topology and nonlinearity in photonic systems generally forbids the sustainability of optical currents. Here, we systematically explore the nonlinear evolution dynamics in topological photonic lattices within the framework of optical thermodynamics. By considering an archetypical two-dimensional Haldane photonic lattice, we discover several prethermal states beyond the topological phase transition point and a stable global equilibrium response, associated with a specific optical temperature and chemical potential. Along these lines, we provide a consistent thermodynamic methodology for both controlling and maximizing the unidirectional power flow in the topological edge states. This can be achieved by either employing cross-phase interactions between two subsystems or by exploiting self-heating effects in disordered or Floquet topological lattices. Our results indicate that photonic topological systems can in fact support robust photon transport processes even under the extreme complexity introduced by nonlinearity, an important feature for contemporary topological applications in photonics.",The nonlinear evolution dynamics in topological photonic lattices is systematically investigated within the framework of optical thermodynamics. This approach allows for the precise prediction of topological currents even under the extreme complexity introduced by nonlinearity.,2022-07-29
1099,An acquired phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate transport initiates T-cell deterioration and leukemogenesis,"Lipid remodeling is crucial for malignant cell transformation and tumorigenesis, but the precise molecular processes involved and direct evidences for these in vivo remain elusive. Here, we report that oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein 4 L (ORP4L) is expressed in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells but not normal T-cells. In ORP4L knock-in T-cells, ORP4L dimerizes with OSBP to control the shuttling of OSBP between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane (PM) as an exchanger of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P]/cholesterol. The PI(4)P arriving at the PM via this transport machinery replenishes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] biosynthesis, thus contributing to PI3K/AKT hyperactivation and T-cell deterioration in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of ORP4L and OSBP dimerization disables PI(4)P transport and T-cell leukemogenesis. In summary, we identify a non-vesicular lipid transport machinery between Golgi and PM maintaining the oncogenic signaling competence initiating T-cell deterioration and leukemogenesis.","The oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 4 (ORP4L) is expressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and is required for leukemogenesis. Here the authors show that ORP4L orchestrates the transport of the phospholipid PI(4)P from Golgi to the plasma membrane, contributing to PI3K/AKT hyperactivation and T-cell leukemogenesis.",2022-07-29
1100,"Large-area transfer of two-dimensional materials free of cracks, contamination and wrinkles via controllable conformal contact","The availability of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials on a wide range of substrates forms the basis for large-area applications, such as graphene integration with silicon-based technologies, which requires graphene on silicon with outperforming carrier mobilities. However, 2D materials were only produced on limited archetypal substrates by chemical vapor deposition approaches. Reliable after-growth transfer techniques, that do not produce cracks, contamination, and wrinkles, are critical for layering 2D materials onto arbitrary substrates. Here we show that, by incorporating oxhydryl groups-containing volatile molecules, the supporting films can be deformed under heat to achieve a controllable conformal contact, enabling the large-area transfer of 2D films without cracks, contamination, and wrinkles. The resulting conformity with enhanced adhesion facilitates the direct delamination of supporting films from graphene, providing ultraclean surfaces and carrier mobilities up to 1,420,000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 4 K.","Reliable transfer techniques are critical for the integration of 2D materials with arbitrary substrates. Here, the authors describe a method to transfer 4-inch and A4-sized defect-free graphene films onto rigid and flexible substrates with controllable conformal contact, leading to improved electrical properties and uniformity.",2022-07-29
1101,FLASHIda enables intelligent data acquisition for top–down proteomics to boost proteoform identification counts,"The detailed analysis and structural characterization of proteoforms by top-down proteomics (TDP) has gained a lot of interest in biomedical research. Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) of intact proteins is non-trivial due to the diversity and complexity of proteoforms. Dedicated acquisition methods thus have the potential to greatly improve TDP. Here, we present FLASHIda, an intelligent online data acquisition algorithm for TDP that ensures the real-time selection of high-quality precursors of diverse proteoforms. FLASHIda combines fast charge deconvolution algorithms and machine learning-based quality assessment for optimal precursor selection. In an analysis of E. coli lysate, FLASHIda increases the number of unique proteoform level identifications from 800 to 1500 or generates a near-identical number of identifications in one third of the instrument time when compared to standard DDA mode. Furthermore, FLASHIda enables sensitive mapping of post-translational modifications and detection of chemical adducts. As a software extension module to the instrument, FLASHIda can be readily adopted for TDP studies of complex samples to enhance proteoform identification rates.","Data acquisition suitable for top-down proteomics (TDP) has the potential to significantly improve proteoform analysis. Here, the authors present FLASHIda, an intelligent online data acquisition algorithm for TDP that nearly doubles the number of proteoform-level identifications in complex samples.",2022-07-29
1102,Tryptophan C-mannosylation is critical for Plasmodium falciparum transmission,"Tryptophan C-mannosylation stabilizes proteins bearing a thrombospondin repeat (TSR) domain in metazoans. Here we show that Plasmodium falciparum expresses a DPY19 tryptophan C-mannosyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum and that DPY19-deficiency abolishes C-glycosylation, destabilizes members of the TRAP adhesin family and inhibits transmission to mosquitoes. Imaging P. falciparum gametogenesis in its entirety in four dimensions using lattice light-sheet microscopy reveals defects in ΔDPY19 gametocyte egress and exflagellation. While egress is diminished, ΔDPY19 microgametes still fertilize macrogametes, forming ookinetes, but these are abrogated for mosquito infection. The gametogenesis defects correspond with destabilization of MTRAP, which we show is C-mannosylated in P. falciparum, and the ookinete defect is concordant with defective CTRP secretion on the ΔDPY19 background. Genetic complementation of DPY19 restores ookinete infectivity, sporozoite production and C-mannosylation activity. Therefore, tryptophan C-mannosylation by DPY19 ensures TSR protein quality control at two lifecycle stages for successful transmission of the human malaria parasite.","Here, Lopaticki et al. show that Plasmodium falciparum expresses a Dpy19 C-mannosyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum that glycosylates TSR domains. Functional characterization shows that PfDpy19 plays a critical role in transmission through mosquitoes as PfDpy19-deficiency abolishes C-glycosylation and destabilizes proteins relevant for gametogenesis and oocyst formation.",2022-07-29
1103,Defunctionalizing intracellular organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes with engineered phospholipase A/acyltransferases,"Organelles vitally achieve multifaceted functions to maintain cellular homeostasis. Genetic and pharmacological approaches to manipulate individual organelles are powerful in probing their physiological roles. However, many of them are either slow in action, limited to certain organelles, or rely on toxic agents. Here, we design a generalizable molecular tool utilizing phospholipase A/acyltransferases (PLAATs) for rapid defunctionalization of organelles via remodeling of the membrane phospholipids. In particular, we identify catalytically active PLAAT truncates with minimal unfavorable characteristics. Chemically-induced translocation of the optimized PLAAT to the mitochondria surface results in their rapid deformation in a phospholipase activity dependent manner, followed by loss of luminal proteins as well as dissipated membrane potential, thus invalidating the functionality. To demonstrate wide applicability, we then adapt the molecular tool in peroxisomes, and observe leakage of matrix-resident functional proteins. The technique is compatible with optogenetic control, viral delivery and operation in primary neuronal cultures. Due to such versatility, the PLAAT strategy should prove useful in studying organelle biology of diverse contexts.",Approaches for manipulating individual organelles are important for learning more about their functions. Here the authors report a tool utilising phospholipase A/acyltransferases (PLAATs) for rapid defunctionalisation of organelles through remodelling of the membrane phospholipids.,2022-07-29
1104,Development of quasi-solid-state anode-free high-energy lithium sulfide-based batteries,"Anode-free lithium batteries without lithium metal excess are a practical option to maximize the energy content beyond the conventional design of Li-ion and Li metal batteries. However, their performance and reliability are still limited by using low-capacity oxygen-releasing intercalation cathodes and flammable liquid electrolytes. Herein, we propose quasi-solid-state anode-free batteries containing lithium sulfide-based cathodes and non-flammable polymeric gel electrolytes. Such batteries exhibit an energy density of 1323 Wh L−1 at the pouch cell level. Moreover, the lithium sulfide-based anode-free cell chemistry endows intrinsic safety thanks to a lack of uncontrolled exothermic reactions of reactive oxygen and excess Li inventory. Furthermore, the non-flammable gel electrolyte, developed from MXene-doped fluorinated polymer, inhibits polysulfide shuttling, hinders Li dendrite formation and further secures cell safety. Finally, we demonstrate the improved cell safety against mechanical, electrical and thermal abuses.","The development of anode-free batteries requires investigations at the electrode and electrolyte levels. Here, the authors report a high-energy quasi-solid-state anode-free pouch cell with a Li2S-based cathode that demonstrates enhanced safety features.",2022-07-29
1105,Orbitofrontal cortex contributes to the comparison of values underlying economic choices,"Economic choices between goods entail the computation and comparison of subjective values. Previous studies examined neuronal activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of monkeys choosing between different types of juices. Three groups of neurons were identified: offer value cells encoding the value of individual offers, chosen juice cells encoding the identity of the chosen juice, and chosen value cells encoding the value of the chosen offer. The encoded variables capture both the input (offer value) and the output (chosen juice, chosen value) of the decision process, suggesting that values are compared within OFC. Recent work demonstrates that choices are causally linked to the activity of offer value cells. Conversely, the hypothesis that OFC contributes to value comparison has not been confirmed. Here we show that weak electrical stimulation of OFC specifically disrupts value comparison without altering offer values. This result implies that neuronal populations in OFC participate in value comparison.","Economic choices entail the comparison of offer values, but the neural underpinnings of this process are poorly understood. Here the authors show that weak electrical stimulation of the orbitofrontal cortex selectively disrupts value comparison without affecting offer values.",2022-07-29
1106,Proteotoxicity caused by perturbed protein complexes underlies hybrid incompatibility in yeast,"Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities represent a major driver of reproductive isolation between species. They are caused when interacting components encoded by alleles from different species cannot function properly when mixed. At incipient stages of speciation, complex incompatibilities involving multiple genetic loci with weak effects are frequently observed, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show perturbed proteostasis leading to compromised mitosis and meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae hybrid lines carrying one or two chromosomes from Saccharomyces bayanus var. uvarum. Levels of proteotoxicity are correlated with the number of protein complexes on replaced chromosomes. Proteomic approaches reveal that multi-protein complexes with subunits encoded by replaced chromosomes tend to be unstable. Furthermore, hybrid defects can be alleviated or aggravated, respectively, by up- or down-regulating the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation machinery, suggesting that destabilized complex subunits overburden the proteostasis machinery and compromise hybrid fitness. Our findings reveal the general role of impaired protein complex assembly in complex incompatibilities.","Hybrid incompatibility can be an important element of reproductive isolation and speciation. Using chromosome replacement lines of yeast, the authors show that perturbed proteostasis caused by destabilized hybrid protein complexes may represent a general mechanism of hybrid incompatibility.",2022-07-29
1107,Divergent synthesis of benzazepines and bridged polycycloalkanones via dearomative rearrangement,"The dearomative functionalization of aromatic compounds represents a fascinating but challenging transformation, as it typically needs to overcome a great kinetic barrier. Here, a catalyst-free dearomative rearrangement of o-nitrophenyl alkyne is successfully established by leveraging the remote oxygen transposition and a weak N-O bond acceleration. This reaction features high atom-, step- and redox-economy, which provides a divergent entry to a series of biologically important benzazepines and bridged polycycloalkanones. The reaction is proposed to proceed through a tandem oxygen transfer cyclization/(3 + 2) cycloaddition/(homo-)hetero-Claisen rearrangement reaction. The resulting polycyclic system is richly decorated with transformable functionalities, such as carbonyl, imine and diene, which enables diversity-oriented synthesis of alkaloid-like polycyclic framework.","The dearomative functionalization of aromatic compounds represents a challenging transformation, as it typically needs to overcome a great kinetic barrier. Here, the authors disclose a weak-bond-accelerated, catalyst-free dearomative [3,3]-rearrangement of o-nitrophenyl alkyne for the divergent synthesis of benzazepines and bridged polycycloalkanones via remote oxygen transposition.",2022-07-29
1108,A multimodal iPSC platform for cystic fibrosis drug testing,"Cystic fibrosis is a monogenic lung disease caused by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator anion channel, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The progress in elucidating the role of CFTR using established animal and cell-based models led to the recent discovery of effective modulators for most individuals with CF. However, a subset of individuals with CF do not respond to these modulators and there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we generate a panel of airway epithelial cells using induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with common or rare CFTR variants representative of three distinct classes of CFTR dysfunction. To measure CFTR function we adapt two established in vitro assays for use in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived airway cells. In both a 3-D spheroid assay using forskolin-induced swelling as well as planar cultures composed of polarized mucociliary airway epithelial cells, we detect genotype-specific differences in CFTR baseline function and response to CFTR modulators. These results demonstrate the potential of the human induced pluripotent stem cell platform as a research tool to study CF and in particular accelerate therapeutic development for CF caused by rare variants.","Hundreds of mutations in the gene CFTR lead to cystic fibrosis and represent a challenge to developing therapeutics. Here, authors demonstrate the ability of airway cells derived from human iPSCs to model genotype-specific CFTR function as well as pharmacologic rescue of disease causing mutations.",2022-07-29
1109,CDK9 activity switch associated with AFF1 and HEXIM1 controls differentiation initiation from epidermal progenitors,"Progenitors in epithelial tissues, such as human skin epidermis, continuously make fate decisions between self-renewal and differentiation. Here we show that the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) controls progenitor fate decisions by directly suppressing a group of “rapid response” genes, which feature high enrichment of paused Pol II in the progenitor state and robust Pol II elongation in differentiation. SEC’s repressive role is dependent on the AFF1 scaffold, but not AFF4. In the progenitor state, AFF1-SEC associates with the HEXIM1-containing inactive CDK9 to suppress these rapid-response genes. A key rapid-response SEC target is ATF3, which promotes the upregulation of differentiation-activating transcription factors (GRHL3, OVOL1, PRDM1, ZNF750) to advance terminal differentiation. SEC peptidomimetic inhibitors or PKC signaling activates CDK9 and rapidly induces these transcription factors within hours in keratinocytes. Thus, our data suggest that the activity switch of SEC-associated CDK9 underlies the initial processes bifurcating progenitor fates between self-renewal and differentiation.","Epidermal progenitors are poised for differentiation, which allows for continual balance of self-renewal and differentiation. Here they show that the Super Elongation Complex regulates this process through direct regulation of a set of rapid response genes that involves a CDK9 activity switch.",2022-07-29
1110,HSF1 phosphorylation establishes an active chromatin state via the TRRAP–TIP60 complex and promotes tumorigenesis,"Transcriptional regulation by RNA polymerase II is associated with changes in chromatin structure. Activated and promoter-bound heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) recruits transcriptional co-activators, including histone-modifying enzymes; however, the mechanisms underlying chromatin opening remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HSF1 recruits the TRRAP-TIP60 acetyltransferase complex in HSP72 promoter during heat shock in a manner dependent on phosphorylation of HSF1-S419. TRIM33, a bromodomain-containing ubiquitin ligase, is then recruited to the promoter by interactions with HSF1 and a TIP60-mediated acetylation mark, and cooperates with the related factor TRIM24 for mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B on K120. These changes in histone modifications are triggered by phosphorylation of HSF1-S419 via PLK1, and stabilize the HSF1-transcription complex in HSP72 promoter. Furthermore, HSF1-S419 phosphorylation is constitutively enhanced in and promotes proliferation of melanoma cells. Our results provide mechanisms for HSF1 phosphorylation-dependent establishment of an active chromatin status, which is important for tumorigenesis.","Here the authors show phosphorylation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) at S419 via the chromatin-bound kinase PLK1, promotes HSF1 recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and histone acetylation reader proteins TRIM33 and TRIM24, which actually also execute histone H2BK120 mono-ubiquitination at target genes. Furthermore, HSF1 phosphorylation has an impact on melanoma cell proliferation.",2022-07-29
1111,Transcription factor network analysis identifies REST/NRSF as an intrinsic regulator of CNS regeneration in mice,"The inability of neurons to regenerate long axons within the CNS is a major impediment to improving outcome after spinal cord injury, stroke, and other CNS insults. Recent advances have uncovered an intrinsic program that involves coordinate regulation by multiple transcription factors that can be manipulated to enhance growth in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we use a systems genomics approach to characterize regulatory relationships of regeneration-associated transcription factors, identifying RE1-Silencing Transcription Factor (REST; Neuron-Restrictive Silencer Factor, NRSF) as a predicted upstream suppressor of a pro-regenerative gene program associated with axon regeneration in the CNS. We validate our predictions using multiple paradigms, showing that mature mice bearing cell type-specific deletions of REST or expressing dominant-negative mutant REST show improved regeneration of the corticospinal tract and optic nerve after spinal cord injury and optic nerve crush, which is accompanied by upregulation of regeneration-associated genes in cortical motor neurons and retinal ganglion cells, respectively. These analyses identify a role for REST as an upstream suppressor of the intrinsic regenerative program in the CNS and demonstrate the utility of a systems biology approach involving integrative genomics and bio-informatics to prioritize hypotheses relevant to CNS repair.","Here the authors couple an integrative genomic analysis with substantial in vitro and in vivo experimental validation, identifying REST as a novel suppressor of a pro-regenerative gene program and CNS axon regeneration in mice.",2022-07-29
1112,Fatigue-free artificial ionic skin toughened by self-healable elastic nanomesh,"Robust ionic sensing materials that are both fatigue-resistant and self-healable like human skin are essential for soft electronics and robotics with extended service life. However, most existing self-healable artificial ionic skins produced on the basis of network reconfiguration suffer from a low fatigue threshold due to the easy fracture of low-energy amorphous polymer chains with susceptible crack propagation. Here we engineer a fatigue-free yet fully healable hybrid ionic skin toughened by a high-energy, self-healable elastic nanomesh, resembling the repairable nanofibrous interwoven structure of human skin. Such a design affords a superhigh fatigue threshold of 2950 J m−2 while maintaining skin-like compliance, stretchability, and strain-adaptive stiffening response. Moreover, nanofiber tension-induced moisture breathing of ionic matrix leads to a record-high strain-sensing gauge factor of 66.8, far exceeding previous intrinsically stretchable ionic conductors. This concept creates opportunities for designing durable ion-conducting materials that replicate the unparalleled combinatory properties of natural skins more precisely.","Developing robust skin-like sensing materials is essential for soft electronics and robotics with extended service life. Here, inspired by the repairable nanofibrous structure of human skin, the authors engineer a fatigue-resistant artificial ionic skin toughened by self-healable elastic nanomesh.",2022-07-29
1113,Three-dimensional printing of photonic colloidal glasses into objects with isotropic structural color,"Structural color is frequently exploited by living organisms for biological functions and has also been translated into synthetic materials as a more durable and less hazardous alternative to conventional pigments. Additive manufacturing approaches were recently exploited for the fabrication of exquisite photonic objects, but the angle-dependence observed limits a broader application of structural color in synthetic systems. Here, we propose a manufacturing platform for the 3D printing of complex-shaped objects that display isotropic structural color generated from photonic colloidal glasses. Structurally colored objects are printed from aqueous colloidal inks containing monodisperse silica particles, carbon black, and a gel-forming copolymer. Rheology and Small-Angle-X-Ray-Scattering measurements are performed to identify the processing conditions leading to printed objects with tunable structural colors. Multimaterial printing is eventually used to create complex-shaped objects with multiple structural colors using silica and carbon as abundant and sustainable building blocks.",There is a growing interest in mimicking structural color in natural systems aiming for sustainable and long-lasting color. Here the authors report a platform for three-dimensional printing assembly of colloidal particles of silica and carbon that have programmable structural color.,2022-07-29
1114,Photocatalytic dehydrogenative C-C coupling of acetonitrile to succinonitrile,"The coupling of acetonitrile into succinonitrile, an important terminal dinitrile for value-added nylon production, via a dehydrogenative route is highly attractive, as it combines the valuable chemical synthesis with the production of green hydrogen energy. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a highly selective light driven dehydrogenative coupling of acetonitrile molecules to synthesize succinonitrile using anatase TiO2 based photocatalysts in aqueous medium under mild conditions. Under optimized conditions, the formation rate of succinonitrile reaches 6.55 mmol/(gcat*h), with over 97.5% selectivity to target product. Mechanism studies reveal that water acts as cocatalyst in the reaction. The excited hole of anatase semiconductor oxidizes water forming hydroxyl radical, which subsequently assists the cleavage of sp3 C-H bond of acetonitrile to generate ·CH2CN radical for further C-C coupling. The synergy between TiO2 and Pt cocatalyst is important to enhance the succinonitrile selectivity and prevent undesirable over-oxidation and hydrolysis. This work offers an alternative route to prepare succinonitrile based on renewable energy under mild conditions and avoid the use of toxic reagents and stoichiometric oxidative radical initiators.","The coupling of acetonitrile into succinonitrile via a dehydrogenative route is highly attractive in terms of valuable chemical synthesis and green hydrogen energy production. Here, the authors report succinonitrile synthesis with high selectivity and rate via a light driven dehydrogenative coupling reaction of CH3CN over the anatase TiO2 supported Pt catalyst.",2022-07-28
1115,Protein secondary structure in spider silk nanofibrils,"Nanofibrils play a pivotal role in spider silk and are responsible for many of the impressive properties of this unique natural material. However, little is known about the internal structure of these protein fibrils. We carry out polarized Raman and polarized Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopies on native spider silk nanofibrils and determine the concentrations of six distinct protein secondary structures, including β-sheets, and two types of helical structures, for which we also determine orientation distributions. Our advancements in peak assignments are in full agreement with the published silk vibrational spectroscopy literature. We further corroborate our findings with X-ray diffraction and magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Based on the latter and on polypeptide Raman spectra, we assess the role of key amino acids in different secondary structures. For the recluse spider we develop a highly detailed structural model, featuring seven levels of structural hierarchy. The approaches we develop are directly applicable to other proteinaceous materials.","Secondary fibril structure is a key component of the mechanical properties of protein materials like silk, yet, limited information is known about the internal structure of these protein fibrils. Here, the authors report on the use of polarised Raman and FTIR spectroscopy to study silk materials and identify six distinct secondary structures.",2022-07-28
1116,Microbial biofilms for electricity generation from water evaporation and power to wearables,"Employing renewable materials for fabricating clean energy harvesting devices can further improve sustainability. Microorganisms can be mass produced with renewable feedstocks. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to engineer microbial biofilms as a cohesive, flexible material for long-term continuous electricity production from evaporating water. Single biofilm sheet (~40 µm thick) serving as the functional component in an electronic device continuously produces power density (~1 μW/cm2) higher than that achieved with thicker engineered materials. The energy output is comparable to that achieved with similar sized biofilms catalyzing current production in microbial fuel cells, without the need for an organic feedstock or maintaining cell viability. The biofilm can be sandwiched between a pair of mesh electrodes for scalable device integration and current production. The devices maintain the energy production in ionic solutions and can be used as skin-patch devices to harvest electricity from sweat and moisture on skin to continuously power wearable devices. Biofilms made from different microbial species show generic current production from water evaporation. These results suggest that we can harness the ubiquity of biofilms in nature as additional sources of biomaterial for evaporation-based electricity generation in diverse aqueous environments.","Though water evaporation-driven electricity generation is an attractive sustainable energy production strategy, existing electronic devices suffer from poor performance or is costly. Here, the authors report sustainable biofilms for efficient, low-cost evaporation-based electricity production",2022-07-28
1117,Single-droplet surface-enhanced Raman scattering decodes the molecular determinants of liquid-liquid phase separation,"Biomolecular condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) are involved in a myriad of critical cellular functions and debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. Elucidating the role of intrinsic disorder and conformational heterogeneity of intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) in these phase-separated membrane-less organelles is crucial to understanding the mechanism of formation and regulation of biomolecular condensates. Here we introduce a unique single-droplet surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) methodology that utilizes surface-engineered, plasmonic, metal nanoparticles to unveil the inner workings of mesoscopic liquid droplets of Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) in the absence and presence of RNA. These highly sensitive measurements offer unprecedented sensitivity to capture the crucial interactions, conformational heterogeneity, and structural distributions within the condensed phase in a droplet-by-droplet manner. Such an ultra-sensitive single-droplet vibrational methodology can serve as a potent tool to decipher the key molecular drivers of biological phase transitions of a wide range of biomolecular condensates involved in physiology and disease.",The authors introduce a unique single-droplet surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) methodology that illuminates a wealth of molecular information within the mesoscopic liquid condensed phase of Fused in Sarcoma in the absence and presence of RNA.,2022-07-28
1118,Confinement anisotropy drives polar organization of two DNA molecules interacting in a nanoscale cavity,"There is growing appreciation for the role phase transition based phenomena play in biological systems. In particular, self-avoiding polymer chains are predicted to undergo a unique confinement dependent demixing transition as the anisotropy of the confined space is increased. This phenomenon may be relevant for understanding how interactions between multiple dsDNA molecules can induce self-organized structure in prokaryotes. While recent in vivo experiments and Monte Carlo simulations have delivered essential insights into this phenomenon and its relation to bacteria, there are fundamental questions remaining concerning how segregated polymer states arise, the role of confinement anisotropy and the nature of the dynamics in the segregated states. To address these questions, we introduce an artificial nanofluidic model to quantify the interactions of multiple dsDNA molecules in cavities with controlled anisotropy. We find that two dsDNA molecules of equal size confined in an elliptical cavity will spontaneously demix and orient along the cavity poles as cavity eccentricity is increased; the two chains will then swap pole positions with a frequency that decreases with increasing cavity eccentricity. In addition, we explore a system consisting of a large dsDNA molecule and a plasmid molecule. We find that the plasmid is excluded from the larger molecule and will exhibit a preference for the ellipse poles, giving rise to a non-uniform spatial distribution in the cavity that may help explain the non-uniform plasmid distribution observed during in vivo imaging of high-copy number plasmids in bacteria.",A nanofluidic model system is used to explore how polymer interactions between large dsDNA molecules can give rise to self-organizing behavior in compartments with controlled anisotropy. The reported findings may help explain the observed non-uniform distribution of plasmids in E. coli.,2022-07-28
1119,Dynamics of competing SARS-CoV-2 variants during the Omicron epidemic in England,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been characterised by the regular emergence of genomic variants. With natural and vaccine-induced population immunity at high levels, evolutionary pressure favours variants better able to evade SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies. The Omicron variant (first detected in November 2021) exhibited a high degree of immune evasion, leading to increased infection rates worldwide. However, estimates of the magnitude of this Omicron wave have often relied on routine testing data, which are prone to several biases. Using data from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study, a series of cross-sectional surveys assessing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England, we estimated the dynamics of England’s Omicron wave (from 9 September 2021 to 1 March 2022). We estimate an initial peak in national Omicron prevalence of 6.89% (5.34%, 10.61%) during January 2022, followed by a resurgence in SARS-CoV-2 infections as the more transmissible Omicron sub-lineage, BA.2 replaced BA.1 and BA.1.1. Assuming the emergence of further distinct variants, intermittent epidemics of similar magnitudes may become the ‘new normal’.",This study presents data from the REACT-1 SARS-CoV-2 community sampling study in England from November 2021 to March 2022. They show that the Omicron variant peaked in January with a prevalence of ~7% and that the BA.2 sublineage had a 1.5x higher reproduction number compared to other Omicron sublineages.,2022-07-28

1121,A modular spring-loaded actuator for mechanical activation of membrane proteins,"How cells respond to mechanical forces by converting them into biological signals underlie crucial cellular processes. Our understanding of mechanotransduction has been hindered by technical barriers, including limitations in our ability to effectively apply low range piconewton forces to specific mechanoreceptors on cell membranes without laborious and repetitive trials. To overcome these challenges we introduce the Nano-winch, a robust, easily assembled, programmable DNA origami-based molecular actuator. The Nano-winch is designed to manipulate multiple mechanoreceptors in parallel by exerting fine-tuned, low- piconewton forces in autonomous and remotely activated modes via adjustable single- and double-stranded DNA linkages, respectively. Nano-winches in autonomous mode can land and operate on the cell surface. Targeting the device to integrin stimulated detectable downstream phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, an indication that Nano-winches can be applied to study cellular mechanical processes. Remote activation mode allowed finer extension control and greater force exertion. We united remotely activated Nano-winches with single-channel bilayer experiments to directly observe the opening of a channel by mechanical force in the force responsive gated channel protein, BtuB. This customizable origami provides an instrument-free approach that can be applied to control and explore a diversity of mechanotransduction circuits on living cells.","Studies on mechanotransduction are limited by our ability to apply low range forces to specific mechanoreceptors on cell membranes.

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are expensive to clean up once emitted. Innovative and synergistic strategies are urgently needed, yet process integration and cost-effectiveness remain challenging. An in-situ PFAS remediation system is developed to employ a plant-derived biomimetic nano-framework to achieve highly efficient adsorption and subsequent fungal biotransformation synergistically. The multiple component framework is presented as Renewable Artificial Plant for In-situ Microbial Environmental Remediation (RAPIMER). RAPIMER exhibits high adsorption capacity for the PFAS compounds and diverse adsorption capability toward co-contaminants. Subsequently, RAPIMER provides the substrates and contaminants for in situ bioremediation via fungus Irpex lacteus and promotes PFAS detoxification. RAPIMER arises from cheap lignocellulosic sources, enabling a broader impact on sustainability and a means for low-cost pollutant remediation.","Persistent organic pollutant (POP) remediation is important for protecting the environment and human health but can be expensive.

A key input for the Laplace equation is the curvature of space. Here we discuss and experimentally demonstrate that the spectral ordering of Laplacian eigenstates for hyperbolic (negatively curved) and flat two-dimensional spaces has a universally different structure. We use a lattice regularization of hyperbolic space in an electric-circuit network to measure the eigenstates of a ‘hyperbolic drum’, and in a time-resolved experiment we verify signal propagation along the curved geodesics. Our experiments showcase both a versatile platform to emulate hyperbolic lattices in tabletop experiments, and a set of methods to verify the effective hyperbolic metric in this and other platforms. The presented techniques can be utilized to explore novel aspects of both classical and quantum dynamics in negatively curved spaces, and to realise the emerging models of topological hyperbolic matter.","Spaces with negative curvature are difficult to realise and investigate experimentally, but they can be emulated with synthetic matter. Here, the authors show how to do this using an electric circuit network, and present a method to characterize and verify the hyperbolic nature of the implemented model.",2022-07-28
1124,Protein shape sampled by ion mobility mass spectrometry consistently improves protein structure prediction,"Ion mobility (IM) mass spectrometry provides structural information about protein shape and size in the form of an orientationally-averaged collision cross-section (CCSIM). While IM data have been used with various computational methods, they have not yet been utilized to predict monomeric protein structure from sequence. Here, we show that IM data can significantly improve protein structure determination using the modelling suite Rosetta. We develop the Rosetta Projection Approximation using Rough Circular Shapes (PARCS) algorithm that allows for fast and accurate prediction of CCSIM from structure. Following successful testing of the PARCS algorithm, we use an integrative modelling approach to utilize IM data for protein structure prediction. Additionally, we propose a confidence metric that identifies near native models in the absence of a known structure. The results of this study demonstrate the ability of IM data to consistently improve protein structure prediction.","Collision cross sections (CCS) from ion mobility mass spectrometry provide information about protein shape and size. Here, the authors develop an algorithm to predict CCS and integrate experimental ion mobility data into Rosetta-based molecular modelling to predict protein structures from sequence.",2022-07-28
1125,Fusion protein strategies for cryo-EM study of G protein-coupled receptors,"Single particle cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is used extensively to determine structures of activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in complex with G proteins or arrestins. However, applying it to GPCRs without signaling proteins remains challenging because most receptors lack structural features in their soluble domains to facilitate image alignment. In GPCR crystallography, inserting a fusion protein between transmembrane helices 5 and 6 is a highly successful strategy for crystallization. Although a similar strategy has the potential to broadly facilitate cryo-EM structure determination of GPCRs alone without signaling protein, the critical determinants that make this approach successful are not yet clear. Here, we address this shortcoming by exploring different fusion protein designs, which lead to structures of antagonist bound A2A adenosine receptor at 3.4 Å resolution and unliganded Smoothened at 3.7 Å resolution. The fusion strategies explored here are likely applicable to cryo-EM interrogation of other GPCRs and small integral membrane proteins.","Here, Zhang et al. explore fusion protein strategies to facilitate cryo-EM structural studies of GPCRs alone- without signal transducers- in ligand bound or unliganded form.",2022-07-28
1126,Metaplastic and energy-efficient biocompatible graphene artificial synaptic transistors for enhanced accuracy neuromorphic computing,"CMOS-based computing systems that employ the von Neumann architecture are relatively limited when it comes to parallel data storage and processing. In contrast, the human brain is a living computational signal processing unit that operates with extreme parallelism and energy efficiency. Although numerous neuromorphic electronic devices have emerged in the last decade, most of them are rigid or contain materials that are toxic to biological systems. In this work, we report on biocompatible bilayer graphene-based artificial synaptic transistors (BLAST) capable of mimicking synaptic behavior. The BLAST devices leverage a dry ion-selective membrane, enabling long-term potentiation, with ~50 aJ/µm2 switching energy efficiency, at least an order of magnitude lower than previous reports on two-dimensional material-based artificial synapses. The devices show unique metaplasticity, a useful feature for generalizable deep neural networks, and we demonstrate that metaplastic BLASTs outperform ideal linear synapses in classic image classification tasks. With switching energy well below the 1 fJ energy estimated per biological synapse, the proposed devices are powerful candidates for bio-interfaced online learning, bridging the gap between artificial and biological neural networks.","Designing biocompatible and flexible electronic devices for neuromrophic applications remains a challenge. Here, Kireev et al. propose graphene-based artificial synaptic transistors with low-energy switching, long-term potentiation, and metaplasticity for future bio-interfaced neural networks.",2022-07-28
1127,Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate controls autophagosome formation in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Autophagy is an intracellular degradation mechanism critical for plant acclimation to environmental stresses. Central to autophagy is the formation of specialized vesicles, the autophagosomes, which target and deliver cargo to the lytic vacuole. How autophagosomes form in plant cells remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover the importance of the lipid phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate in autophagy using pharmacological and genetical approaches. Combining biochemical and live-microscopy analyses, we show that PI4K activity is required for early stages of autophagosome formation. Further, our results show that the plasma membrane-localized PI4Kα1 is involved in autophagy and that a substantial portion of autophagy structures are found in proximity to the PI4P-enriched plasma membrane. Together, our study unravels critical insights into the molecular determinants of autophagy, proposing a model whereby the plasma membrane provides PI4P to support the proper assembly and expansion of the phagophore thus governing autophagosome formation in Arabidopsis.",Autophagosomes are specialized vesicles that target and deliver cargo to the lytic vacuole. Here the authors show that plasma-membrane derived lipid phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate supports the assembly and expansion of autophagosomes in Arabidopsis,2022-07-28
1128,Inverse altitude effect disputes the theoretical foundation of stable isotope paleoaltimetry,"Stable isotope paleoaltimetry that reconstructs paleoelevation requires stable isotope (δD or δ18O) values to follow the altitude effect. Some studies found that the δD or δ18O values of surface isotopic carriers in some regions increase with increasing altitude, which is defined as an “inverse altitude effect” (IAE). The IAE directly contradicts the basic theory of stable isotope paleoaltimetry. However, the causes of the IAE remain unclear. Here, we explore the mechanisms of the IAE from an atmospheric circulation perspective using δD in water vapor on a global scale. We find that two processes cause the IAE: (1) the supply of moisture with higher isotopic values from distant source regions, and (2) intense lateral mixing between the lower and mid-troposphere along the moisture transport pathway. Therefore, we caution that the influences of those two processes need careful consideration for different mountain uplift stages before using stable isotope palaeoaltimetry.",The “inverse altitude effect” (IEA) directly contradicts the basic theory of stable isotope paleoaltimetry. This study explores the causes of the IAE from an atmospheric circulation perspective using δD in water vapor on the global scale.,2022-07-28
1129,Topological digestion drives time-varying rheology of entangled DNA fluids,"Understanding and controlling the rheology of polymeric complex fluids that are pushed out-of-equilibrium is a fundamental problem in both industry and biology. For example, to package, repair, and replicate DNA, cells use enzymes to constantly manipulate DNA topology, length, and structure. Inspired by this feat, here we engineer and study DNA-based complex fluids that undergo enzymatically-driven topological and architectural alterations via restriction endonuclease (RE) reactions. We show that these systems display time-dependent rheological properties that depend on the concentrations and properties of the comprising DNA and REs. Through time-resolved microrheology experiments and Brownian Dynamics simulations, we show that conversion of supercoiled to linear DNA topology leads to a monotonic increase in viscosity. On the other hand, the viscosity of entangled linear DNA undergoing fragmentation displays a universal decrease that we rationalise using living polymer theory. Finally, to showcase the tunability of these behaviours, we design a DNA fluid that exhibits a time-dependent increase, followed by a temporally-gated decrease, of its viscosity. Our results present a class of polymeric fluids that leverage naturally occurring enzymes to drive diverse time-varying rheology by performing architectural alterations to the constituents.","Understanding and controlling the rheology of polymeric complex fluids is of fundamental importance in both industry and biology. Here, Michieletto et al. show how to achieve time-dependent rheology of DNA solutions via enzymatically-driven architectural alterations by restriction endonucleases.",2022-07-28
1130,A density-based enrichment measure for assessing colocalization in single-molecule localization microscopy data,"Dual-color single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) provides unprecedented possibilities for detailed studies of colocalization of different molecular species in a cell. However, the informational richness of the data is not fully exploited by current analysis tools that often reduce colocalization to a single value. Here, we describe a tool specifically designed for determination of co-localization in both 2D and 3D from SMLM data. The approach uses a function that describes the relative enrichment of one molecular species on the density distribution of a reference species. The function reframes the question of colocalization by providing a density-context relevant to multiple biological questions. Moreover, the function visualize enrichment (i.e. colocalization) directly in the images for easy interpretation. We demonstrate the approach’s functionality on both simulated data and cultured neurons, and compare it to current alternative measures. The method is available in a Python function for easy and parameter-free implementation.",Full information gained from single-molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) isn't exploited by current analysis tools. Here the authors report relative enrichment which uses a density-based colocalisation measure for both 2D and 3D SMLM data; they apply it to both simulated data and cultured neurons.,2022-07-28
1131,High-temperature flexible WSe2 photodetectors with ultrahigh photoresponsivity,"The development of high-temperature photodetectors can be beneficial for numerous applications, such as aerospace engineering, military defence and harsh-environments robotics. However, current high-temperature photodetectors are characterized by low photoresponsivity (<10 A/W) due to the poor optical sensitivity of commonly used heat-resistant materials. Here, we report the realization of h-BN-encapsulated graphite/WSe2 photodetectors which can endure temperatures up to 700 °C in air (1000 °C in vacuum) and exhibit unconventional negative photoconductivity (NPC) at high temperatures. Operated in NPC mode, the devices show a photoresponsivity up to 2.2 × 106 A/W, which is ~5 orders of magnitude higher than that of state-of-the-art high-temperature photodetectors. Furthermore, our devices demonstrate good flexibility, making it highly adaptive to various shaped surfaces. Our approach can be extended to other 2D materials and may stimulate further developments of 2D optoelectronic devices operating in harsh environments.","High-temperature photodetectors are desired for aerospace applications and harsh-environment robotics, but their responsivity is usually limited. Here, the authors report flexible hBN-encapsulated graphite/WSe2 photodetectors which can endure temperatures up to 700 °C in air with enhanced photoresponsivity.",2022-07-28
1132,Rates and drivers of aboveground carbon accumulation in global monoculture plantation forests,"Restoring forest cover is a key action for mitigating climate change. Although monoculture plantations dominate existing commitments to restore forest cover, we lack a synthetic view of how carbon accumulates in these systems. Here, we assemble a global database of 4756 field-plot measurements from monoculture plantations across all forested continents. With these data, we model carbon accumulation in aboveground live tree biomass and examine the biological, environmental, and human drivers that influence this growth. Our results identify four-fold variation in carbon accumulation rates across tree genera, plant functional types, and biomes, as well as the key mediators (e.g., genus of tree, endemism of species, prior land use) of variation in these rates. Our nonlinear growth models advance our understanding of carbon accumulation in forests relative to mean annual rates, particularly during the next few decades that are critical for mitigating climate change.","Tree planting is a promising yet controversial natural climate solution. Here the authors perform a global analysis of aboveground C accumulation in tree monocultures, identifying key predictors such as prior land use, taxonomic identity, and plant traits.",2022-07-28
1133,Aberrant androgen action in prostatic progenitor cells induces oncogenesis and tumor development through IGF1 and Wnt axes,"Androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways are essential for prostate tumorigenesis. However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the AR functioning as a tumor promoter in inducing prostatic oncogenesis still remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of prostatic Osr1 (odd skipped-related 1)-lineage cells functions as tumor progenitors in prostate tumorigenesis. Single cell transcriptomic analyses reveal that aberrant AR activation in these cells elevates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling pathways and initiates oncogenic transformation. Elevating IGF1 signaling further cumulates Wnt/β-catenin pathways in transformed cells to promote prostate tumor development. Correlations between altered androgen, IGF1, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling are also identified in human prostate cancer samples, uncovering a dynamic regulatory loop initiated by the AR through prostate cancer development. Co-inhibition of androgen and Wnt-signaling pathways significantly represses the growth of AR-positive tumor cells in both ex-vivo and in-vivo, implicating co-targeting therapeutic strategies for these pathways to treat advanced prostate cancer.",Activation of the androgen receptor (AR) through androgen binding is essential for prostate tumorigenesis. Here the authors show that AR activation in a subpopulation of prostatic progenitor cells can initiate prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia formation and promotes prostate cancer development through activation of IGF1 and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways.,2022-07-28
1134,A Transparent Electrode Based on Solution-Processed ZnO for Organic Optoelectronic Devices,"Achieving high-efficiency indium tin oxide (ITO)-free organic optoelectronic devices requires the development of high-conductivity and high-transparency materials for being used as the front electrode. Herein, sol-gel-grown zinc oxide (ZnO) films with high conductivity (460 S cm−1) and low optical absorption losses in both visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral regions are realized utilizing the persistent photoinduced doping effect. The origin of the increased conductivity after photo-doping is ascribed to selective trapping of photogenerated holes by oxygen vacancies at the surface of the ZnO film. Then, the conductivity of the sol-gel-grown ZnO is further increased by stacking the ZnO using a newly developed sequential deposition strategy. Finally, the stacked ZnO is used as the cathode to construct ITO-free organic solar cells, photodetectors, and light emitting diodes: The devices based on ZnO outperform those based on ITO, owing to the reduced surface recombination losses at the cathode/active layer interface, and the reduced parasitic absorption losses in the electrodes of the ZnO based devices.","A highly conductive and transparent electrode is essential to achieving a high efficiency in indium tin oxide-free optoelectronic devices. Here, the authors strategically prepare sol-gel-grown zinc oxide films based on photoinduced doping effect and demonstrate enhanced performance of devices.",2022-07-28
1135,De novo determination of mosquitocidal Cry11Aa and Cry11Ba structures from naturally-occurring nanocrystals,"Cry11Aa and Cry11Ba are the two most potent toxins produced by mosquitocidal Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis and jegathesan, respectively. The toxins naturally crystallize within the host; however, the crystals are too small for structure determination at synchrotron sources. Therefore, we applied serial femtosecond crystallography at X-ray free electron lasers to in vivo-grown nanocrystals of these toxins. The structure of Cry11Aa was determined de novo using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method, which in turn enabled the determination of the Cry11Ba structure by molecular replacement. The two structures reveal a new pattern for in vivo crystallization of Cry toxins, whereby each of their three domains packs with a symmetrically identical domain, and a cleavable crystal packing motif is located within the protoxin rather than at the termini. The diversity of in vivo crystallization patterns suggests explanations for their varied levels of toxicity and rational approaches to improve these toxins for mosquito control.","An environmentally safe means of mosquito control is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, which produces a cocktail of four naturally crystalline proteins exclusively toxic to mosquito. Here the authors report the atomic-resolution structures of Bti Cry11Aa and related Btj Cry11Ba solved de novo through Serial Femtosecond Crystallography on naturally-occurring nanocrystals.",2022-07-28
1136,Breaking the fundamental scattering limit with gain metasurfaces,"A long-held tenet in physics asserts that particles interacting with light suffer from a fundamental limit to their scattering cross section, referred to as the single-channel scattering limit. This notion, appearing in all one, two, and three dimensions, severely limits the interaction strength between all types of passive resonators and photonic environments and thus constrains a plethora of applications in bioimaging, sensing, and photovoltaics. Here, we propose a route to overcome this limit by exploiting gain media. We show that when an excited resonance is critically coupled to the desired scattering channel, an arbitrarily large scattering cross section can be achieved in principle. From a transient analysis, we explain the formation and relaxation of this phenomenon and compare it with the degeneracy-induced multi-channel superscattering, whose temporal behaviors have been usually overlooked. To experimentally test our predictions, we design a two-dimensional resonator encircled by gain metasurfaces incorporating negative- resistance components and demonstrate that the scattering cross section exceeds the single- channel limit by more than 40-fold. Our findings verify the possibility of stronger scattering beyond the fundamental scattering limit and herald a novel class of light-matter interactions enabled by gain metasurfaces.","Wave-matter interaction suffers from fundamental limit to scattering cross section, referred to as the single-channel scattering limit. Here, the authors break this limit by exploiting gain metasurfaces and reveal the transient formation and relaxation of this phenomenon.",2022-07-28
1137,A unique class of Zn2+-binding serine-based PBPs underlies cephalosporin resistance and sporogenesis in Clostridioides difficile,"Treatment with β-lactam antibiotics, particularly cephalosporins, is a major risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection. These broad-spectrum antibiotics irreversibly inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are serine-based enzymes that assemble the bacterial cell wall. However, C. difficile has four different PBPs (PBP1-3 and SpoVD) with various roles in growth and spore formation, and their specific links to β-lactam resistance in this pathogen are underexplored. Here, we show that PBP2 (known to be essential for vegetative growth) is the primary bactericidal target for β-lactams in C. difficile. PBP2 is insensitive to cephalosporin inhibition, and this appears to be the main basis for cephalosporin resistance in this organism. We determine crystal structures of C. difficile PBP2, alone and in complex with β-lactams, revealing unique features including ligand-induced conformational changes and an active site Zn2+-binding motif that influences β-lactam binding and protein stability. The Zn2+-binding motif is also present in C. difficile PBP3 and SpoVD (which are known to be essential for sporulation), as well as in other bacterial taxa including species living in extreme environments and the human gut. We speculate that this thiol-containing motif and its cognate Zn2+ might function as a redox sensor to regulate cell wall synthesis for survival in adverse or anaerobic environments.","Antibiotics of the β-lactam class inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by targeting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Here, Sacco et al. study the four PBPs present in the pathogen C. difficile, revealing unique structural features and shedding light on the mechanisms underlying β-lactam resistance in this organism.",2022-07-28
1138,PACAP-PAC1R modulates fear extinction via the ventromedial hypothalamus,"Exposure to traumatic stress can lead to fear dysregulation, which has been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous work showed that a polymorphism in the PACAP-PAC1R (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide) system is associated with PTSD risk in women, and PACAP (ADCYAP1)-PAC1R (ADCYAP1R1) are highly expressed in the hypothalamus. Here, we show that female mice subjected to acute stress immobilization (IMO) have fear extinction impairments related to Adcyap1 and Adcyap1r1 mRNA upregulation in the hypothalamus, PACAP-c-Fos downregulation in the Medial Amygdala (MeA), and PACAP-FosB/ΔFosB upregulation in the Ventromedial Hypothalamus dorsomedial part (VMHdm). DREADD-mediated inhibition of MeA neurons projecting to the VMHdm during IMO rescues both PACAP upregulation in VMHdm and the fear extinction impairment. We also found that women with the risk genotype of ADCYAP1R1 rs2267735 polymorphism have impaired fear extinction.",The PACAP-PAC1R neuropeptide system regulates neuroendocrine stress responses.

1139,Pressure-induced monotonic enhancement of Tc to over 30 K in superconducting Pr0.82Sr0.18NiO2 thin films,"The successful synthesis of superconducting infinite-layer nickelate thin films with the highest Tc ≈ 15 K has ignited great enthusiasm for this material class as potential analogs of the high-Tc cuprates. Pursuing a higher Tc is always an imperative task in studying a new superconducting material system. Here we report high-quality Pr0.82Sr0.18NiO2 thin films with Tconset ≈ 17 K synthesized by carefully tuning the amount of CaH2 in the topotactic chemical reduction and the effect of pressure on its superconducting properties by measuring electrical resistivity under various pressures in a cubic anvil cell apparatus. We find that the onset temperature of the superconductivity, Tconset, can be enhanced monotonically from ~17 K at ambient pressure to ~31 K at 12.1 GPa without showing signatures of saturation upon increasing pressure. This encouraging result indicates that the Tc of infinite-layer nickelates superconductors still has room to go higher and it can be further boosted by applying higher pressures or strain engineering in the heterostructure films.","Despite much recent effort, the highest reported Tc of the infinite-layer nickelates remains lower than 15 K. Here, the authors apply pressure to Pr0.82Sr0.18NiO2 thin films and observe a monotonic increase of Tc to 31 K at 12.1 GPa, an increase that does not level off with increasing pressure.",2022-07-28
1140,Copper-catalyzed Z-selective synthesis of acrylamides and polyacrylamides via alkylidene ketenimines,"It remains very important to discover and study new fundamental intermediates consisting of carbon and nitrogen as the abundant elements of organic molecules. The unique alkylidene ketenimine could be formed in situ under mild conditions by an unexpected copper-catalyzed three-component reaction of alkyne, azide and water involving a successive cycloaddition, N2 extrusion and carbene-assisted rearrangement. Only Z-α,β-unsaturated amides instead of E-α,β-unsaturated amides or triazoles were acquired from alkylidene ketenimines with excellent selectivities and stereospecificities. In addition, a series of “approximate” alternating copolymers (poly (triazole-alt-Z-acrylamides)) with high Mns and yields were efficiently afforded by multicomponent polymerization through a very simple operation basing on this multicomponent reaction.","Alkylidene ketenimines are rarely reported, but synthetically useful, reactive intermediates.

1141,"Notch, RORC and IL-23 signals cooperate to promote multi-lineage human innate lymphoid cell differentiation","Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) include cytotoxic natural killer cells and distinct groups of cytokine-producing innate helper cells which participate in immune defense and promote tissue homeostasis. Circulating human ILC precursors (ILCP) able to generate all canonical ILC subsets via multi-potent or uni-potent intermediates according to our previous work. Here we show potential cooperative roles for the Notch and IL-23 signaling pathways for human ILC differentiation from blood ILCP using single cell cloning analyses and validate these findings in patient samples with rare genetic deficiencies in IL12RB1 and RORC. Mechanistically, Notch signaling promotes upregulation of the transcription factor RORC, enabling acquisition of Group 1 (IFN-γ) and Group 3 (IL-17A, IL-22) effector functions in multi-potent and uni-potent ILCP. Interfering with RORC or signaling through its target IL-23R compromises ILC3 effector functions but also generally suppresses ILC production from multi-potent ILCP. Our results identify a Notch->RORC- > IL-23R pathway which operates during human ILC differentiation. These observations may help guide protocols to expand functional ILC subsets in vitro with an aim towards novel ILC therapies for human disease.","Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are effector cells that rapidly respond to immune evading stimuli, and despite their functional diversity arise from common precursors.

1142,Structures of Atm1 provide insight into [2Fe-2S] cluster export from mitochondria,"In eukaryotes, iron-sulfur clusters are essential cofactors for numerous physiological processes, but these clusters are primarily biosynthesized in mitochondria. Previous studies suggest mitochondrial ABCB7-type exporters are involved in maturation of cytosolic iron-sulfur proteins. However, the molecular mechanism for how the ABCB7-type exporters participate in this process remains elusive. Here, we report a series of cryo-electron microscopy structures of a eukaryotic homolog of human ABCB7, CtAtm1, determined at average resolutions ranging from 2.8 to 3.2 Å, complemented by functional characterization and molecular docking in silico. We propose that CtAtm1 accepts delivery from glutathione-complexed iron-sulfur clusters. A partially occluded state links cargo-binding to residues at the mitochondrial matrix interface that line a positively charged cavity, while the binding region becomes internalized and is partially divided in an early occluded state. Collectively, our findings substantially increase the understanding of the transport mechanism of eukaryotic ABCB7-type proteins.","Mitochondrial Atm1 proteins play important roles in the maturation of certain cytosolic proteins.

1143,Targeting transcription in heart failure via CDK7/12/13 inhibition,"Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is associated with high mortality, highlighting an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. As stress-activated cardiac signaling cascades converge on the nucleus to drive maladaptive gene programs, interdicting pathological transcription is a conceptually attractive approach for HFrEF therapy. Here, we demonstrate that CDK7/12/13 are critical regulators of transcription activation in the heart that can be pharmacologically inhibited to improve HFrEF. CDK7/12/13 inhibition using the first-in-class inhibitor THZ1 or RNAi blocks stress-induced transcription and pathologic hypertrophy in cultured rodent cardiomyocytes. THZ1 potently attenuates adverse cardiac remodeling and HFrEF pathogenesis in mice and blocks cardinal features of disease in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. THZ1 suppresses Pol II enrichment at stress-transactivated cardiac genes and inhibits a specific pathologic gene program in the failing mouse heart. These data identify CDK7/12/13 as druggable regulators of cardiac gene transactivation during disease-related stress, suggesting that HFrEF features a critical dependency on transcription that can be therapeutically exploited.","In this study, Hsu et al. show that inhibition of CDK7/12/13 attenuates maladaptive transcriptional activation in cultured cardiomyocytes and a mouse model of heart failure, suggesting that targeting the transcription machinery might be a therapeutic approach to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.",2022-07-27
1144,Lactational delivery of Triclosan promotes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in newborn mice,"Here we show that Triclosan (TCS), a high-volume antimicrobial additive that has been detected in human breastmilk, can be efficiently transferred by lactation to newborn mice, causing significant fatty liver (FL) during the suckling period. These findings are relevant since pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is escalating in the United States, with a limited mechanistic understanding. Lactational delivery stimulated hepatosteatosis, triglyceride accumulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, signs of inflammation, and liver fibrosis. De novo lipogenesis (DNL) induced by lactational TCS exposure is shown to be mediated in a PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-PPARα cascade. The administration of obeticholic acid (OCA), a potent FXR agonist, as well as activation of intestinal mucosal-regenerative gp130 signaling, led to reduced liver ATF4 expression, PPARα signaling, and DNL when neonates were exposed to TCS. It is yet to be investigated but mother to child transmission of TCS or similar toxicants may underlie the recent increases in pediatric NAFLD.",Triclosan is an antimicrobial additive in consumer products that has been detected in human breast milk.

1145,A reconfigurable and magnetically responsive assembly for dynamic solar steam generation,"Interfacial solar vapor generation is a promising technique to efficiently get fresh water from seawater or effluent. However, for the traditional static evaporation models, further performance improvement has encountered bottlenecks due to the lack of dynamic management and self-regulation on the evolving water movement and phase change in the evaporation process. Here, a reconfigurable and magnetically responsive evaporator with conic arrays is developed through the controllable and reversible assembly of graphene wrapped Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Different from the traditional structure-rigid evaporation architecture, the deformable and dynamic assemblies could reconfigure themselves both at macroscopic and microscopic scales in response to the variable magnetic field. Thus, the internal water transportation and external vapor diffusion are greatly promoted simultaneously, leading to a 23% higher evaporation rate than that of static counterparts. Further, well-designed hierarchical assembly and dynamic evaporation system can boost the evaporation rate to a record high level of 5.9 kg m−2 h−1. This proof-of-concept work demonstrates a new direction for development of high performance water evaporation system with the ability of dynamic reconfiguration and reassembly.","Despite a promising water harvesting approach solar steam generation low efficiency remains a challenging obstacle.

We find that 50% of global trade in value terms is maritime, with low-income countries and small islands being 1.5 and 2.0 times more reliant on their ports compared to the global average. The five largest ports globally handle goods that embody >1.4% of global output, while 40 ports add >10% of domestic output of the economies they serve, predominantly small islands. We identify critical cross-border infrastructure dependencies for some landlocked and island countries that rely on specific ports outside their jurisdiction. Our results pave the way for developing new strategies to enhance the resilience and sustainability of port infrastructure and maritime trade.","A new study presents a new global modeling framework to explore the links between ports, maritime transport and global supply-chains, and identifies critical links and dependencies between 1300 ports and the economies that depend on them.",2022-07-27

The ∆3678 virus replicates about 7,500-fold lower than wild-type SARS-CoV-2 on primary human airway cultures, but restores its replication on interferon-deficient Vero-E6 cells that are approved for vaccine production. The ∆3678 virus is highly attenuated in both hamster and K18-hACE2 mouse models. A single-dose immunization of the ∆3678 virus protects hamsters from wild-type virus challenge and transmission. Among the deleted ORFs in the ∆3678 virus, ORF3a accounts for the most attenuation through antagonizing STAT1 phosphorylation during type-I interferon signaling. We also developed an mNeonGreen reporter ∆3678 virus for high-throughput neutralization and antiviral testing. Altogether, the results suggest that ∆3678 SARS-CoV-2 may serve as a live-attenuated vaccine candidate and a research tool for potential biosafety level-2 use.","A live-attenuated COVID vaccine could enrich the current vaccine portfolio.

1148,"Body size, shape and ecology in tetrapods","Body size and shape play fundamental roles in organismal function and it is expected that animals may possess body proportions that are well-suited to their ecological niche. Tetrapods exhibit a diverse array of body shapes, but to date this diversity in body proportions and its relationship to ecology have not been systematically quantified. Using whole-body skeletal models of 410 extinct and extant tetrapods, we show that allometric relationships vary across individual body segments thereby yielding changes in overall body shape as size increases. However, we also find statistical support for quadratic relationships indicative of differential scaling in small-medium versus large animals. Comparisons of locomotor and dietary groups highlight key differences in body proportions that may mechanistically underlie occupation of major ecological niches. Our results emphasise the pivotal role of body proportions in the broad-scale ecological diversity of tetrapods.","Here, the authors examine how body size, shape, and segment proportions correspond to ecology in models of 410 tetrapods. They find variable allometric relationships, differential scaling in small and large animals, and body proportions as a potential niche occupation mechanism.",2022-07-27
1149,Structural network alterations in focal and generalized epilepsy assessed in a worldwide ENIGMA study follow axes of epilepsy risk gene expression,"Epilepsy is associated with genetic risk factors and cortico-subcortical network alterations, but associations between neurobiological mechanisms and macroscale connectomics remain unclear. This multisite ENIGMA-Epilepsy study examined whole-brain structural covariance networks in patients with epilepsy and related findings to postmortem epilepsy risk gene expression patterns. Brain network analysis included 578 adults with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), 288 adults with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), and 1328 healthy controls from 18 centres worldwide. Graph theoretical analysis of structural covariance networks revealed increased clustering and path length in orbitofrontal and temporal regions in TLE, suggesting a shift towards network regularization. Conversely, people with IGE showed decreased clustering and path length in fronto-temporo-parietal cortices, indicating a random network configuration. Syndrome-specific topological alterations reflected expression patterns of risk genes for hippocampal sclerosis in TLE and for generalized epilepsy in IGE. These imaging-transcriptomic signatures could potentially guide diagnosis or tailor therapeutic approaches to specific epilepsy syndromes.","Epilepsy is a brain network disorder with associated genetic risk factors. Here, the authors show that spatial patterns of transcriptomic vulnerability co-vary with structural brain network alterations in focal and generalized epilepsy.",2022-07-27
1150,Genome-wide association study identifies Sjögren’s risk loci with functional implications in immune and glandular cells,"Sjögren’s disease is a complex autoimmune disease with twelve established susceptibility loci. This genome-wide association study (GWAS) identifies ten novel genome-wide significant (GWS) regions in Sjögren’s cases of European ancestry: CD247, NAB1, PTTG1-MIR146A, PRDM1-ATG5, TNFAIP3, XKR6, MAPT-CRHR1, RPTOR-CHMP6-BAIAP6, TYK2, SYNGR1. Polygenic risk scores yield predictability (AUROC = 0.71) and relative risk of 12.08. Interrogation of bioinformatics databases refine the associations, define local regulatory networks of GWS SNPs from the 95% credible set, and expand the implicated gene list to >40. Many GWS SNPs are eQTLs for genes within topologically associated domains in immune cells and/or eQTLs in the main target tissue, salivary glands.","The genetic architecture underlying Sjögren’s syndrome is not fully understood. Here, the authors perform a genome-wide association study to identify 10 new genetic risk regions, implicating genes involved in immune and salivary gland function.",2022-07-27
1151,Maternal and perinatal obesity induce bronchial obstruction and pulmonary hypertension via IL-6-FoxO1-axis in later life,"Obesity is a pre-disposing condition for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Accumulating evidence suggests that metabolic influences during development can determine chronic lung diseases (CLD). We demonstrate that maternal obesity causes early metabolic disorder in the offspring. Here, interleukin-6 induced bronchial and microvascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) hyperproliferation and increased airway and pulmonary vascular resistance. The key anti-proliferative transcription factor FoxO1 was inactivated via nuclear exclusion. These findings were confirmed using primary SMC treated with interleukin-6 and pharmacological FoxO1 inhibition as well as genetic FoxO1 ablation and constitutive activation. In vivo, we reproduced the structural and functional alterations in offspring of obese dams via the SMC-specific ablation of FoxO1. The reconstitution of FoxO1 using IL-6-deficient mice and pharmacological treatment did not protect against metabolic disorder but prevented SMC hyperproliferation. In human observational studies, childhood obesity was associated with reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio Z-score (used as proxy for lung function) and asthma. We conclude that the interleukin-6-FoxO1 pathway in SMC is a molecular mechanism by which perinatal obesity programs the bronchial and vascular structure and function, thereby driving CLD development. Thus, FoxO1 reconstitution provides a potential therapeutic option for preventing this metabolic programming of CLD.","This study shows that maternal and perinatal obesity cause bronchial and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation through an IL-6-FoxO1 axis, and favor thereby the emergence of bronchial obstruction and pulmonary hypertension later in life.",2022-07-27
1152,Dietary protein increases T-cell-independent sIgA production through changes in gut microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles,"Secretory IgA is a key mucosal component ensuring host-microbiota mutualism. Here we use nutritional geometry modelling in mice fed 10 different macronutrient-defined, isocaloric diets, and identify dietary protein as the major driver of secretory IgA production. Protein-driven secretory IgA induction is not mediated by T-cell-dependent pathways or changes in gut microbiota composition. Instead, the microbiota of high protein fed mice produces significantly higher quantities of extracellular vesicles, compared to those of mice fed high-carbohydrate or high-fat diets. These extracellular vesicles activate Toll-like receptor 4 to increase the epithelial expression of IgA-inducing cytokine, APRIL, B cell chemokine, CCL28, and the IgA transporter, PIGR. We show that succinate, produced in high concentrations by microbiota of high protein fed animals, increases generation of reactive oxygen species by bacteria, which in turn promotes extracellular vesicles production. Here we establish a link between dietary macronutrient composition, gut microbial extracellular vesicles release and host secretory IgA response.","Secretory IgA plays vital roles interfacing between the host immune system and the resident microbiota at the mucosal surface. Here the authors explore the effect of dietary protein on the production of secretory IgA, driven by the production of extracellular vesicles by the intestinal microbiota.",2022-07-27
1153,Actin nano-architecture of phagocytic podosomes,"Podosomes are actin-enriched adhesion structures important for multiple cellular processes, including migration, bone remodeling, and phagocytosis. Here, we characterize the structure and organization of phagocytic podosomes using interferometric photoactivated localization microscopy, a super-resolution microscopy technique capable of 15–20 nm resolution, together with structured illumination microscopy and localization-based super-resolution microscopy. Phagocytic podosomes are observed during frustrated phagocytosis, a model in which cells attempt to engulf micropatterned IgG antibodies. For circular patterns, this results in regular arrays of podosomes with well-defined geometry. Using persistent homology, we develop a pipeline for semi-automatic identification and measurement of podosome features. These studies reveal an hourglass shape of the podosome actin core, a protruding knob at the bottom of the core, and two actin networks extending from the core. Additionally, the distributions of paxillin, talin, myosin II, α-actinin, cortactin, and microtubules relative to actin are characterized.","Podosomes are actin structures important in multiple cell functions. Here, the authors use iPALM microscopy to reveal an “hourglass” shape of the podosome actin core, a protruding “knob” at the bottom of the core, and two actin networks extending from it.",2022-07-27
1154,ProtGPT2 is a deep unsupervised language model for protein design,"Protein design aims to build novel proteins customized for specific purposes, thereby holding the potential to tackle many environmental and biomedical problems. Recent progress in Transformer-based architectures has enabled the implementation of language models capable of generating text with human-like capabilities. Here, motivated by this success, we describe ProtGPT2, a language model trained on the protein space that generates de novo protein sequences following the principles of natural ones. The generated proteins display natural amino acid propensities, while disorder predictions indicate that 88% of ProtGPT2-generated proteins are globular, in line with natural sequences. Sensitive sequence searches in protein databases show that ProtGPT2 sequences are distantly related to natural ones, and similarity networks further demonstrate that ProtGPT2 is sampling unexplored regions of protein space. AlphaFold prediction of ProtGPT2-sequences yields well-folded non-idealized structures with embodiments and large loops and reveals topologies not captured in current structure databases. ProtGPT2 generates sequences in a matter of seconds and is freely available.","Protein design aims to build novel proteins customized for specific purposes, thereby holding the potential to tackle many environmental and biomedical problems. Here the authors apply some of the latest advances in natural language processing, generative Transformers, to train ProtGPT2, a language model that explores unseen regions of the protein space while designing proteins with nature-like properties.",2022-07-27
1155,Bayesian tomography of high-dimensional on-chip biphoton frequency combs with randomized measurements,"Owing in large part to the advent of integrated biphoton frequency combs, recent years have witnessed increased attention to quantum information processing in the frequency domain for its inherent high dimensionality and entanglement compatible with fiber-optic networks. Quantum state tomography of such states, however, has required complex and precise engineering of active frequency mixing operations, which are difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we propose a solution that employs a pulse shaper and electro-optic phase modulator to perform random operations instead of mixing in a prescribed manner. We successfully verify the entanglement and reconstruct the full density matrix of biphoton frequency combs generated from an on-chip Si3N4 microring resonator in up to an 8 × 8-dimensional two-qudit Hilbert space, the highest dimension to date for frequency bins. More generally, our employed Bayesian statistical model can be tailored to a variety of quantum systems with restricted measurement capabilities, forming an opportunistic tomographic framework that utilizes all available data in an optimal way.","Full tomography of biphoton frequency comb states requires frequency mixing operations which are hard to scale. Here, the authors propose and demonstrate a protocol exploiting advanced Bayesian statistical methods and randomized measurements coming from complex mode mixing in electro-optic phase modulators.",2022-07-27
1156,Thermodynamics-guided alloy and process design for additive manufacturing,"In conventional processing, metals go through multiple manufacturing steps including casting, plastic deformation, and heat treatment to achieve the desired property. In additive manufacturing (AM) the same target must be reached in one fabrication process, involving solidification and cyclic remelting. The thermodynamic and kinetic differences between the solid and liquid phases lead to constitutional undercooling, local variations in the solidification interval, and unexpected precipitation of secondary phases. These features may cause many undesired defects, one of which is the so-called hot cracking. The response of the thermodynamic and kinetic nature of these phenomena to high cooling rates provides access to the knowledge-based and tailored design of alloys for AM. Here, we illustrate such an approach by solving the hot cracking problem, using the commercially important IN738LC superalloy as a model material. The same approach could also be applied to adapt other hot-cracking susceptible alloy systems for AM.","Production defects prevent many industrially important materials from being adopted by metal additive manufacturing. Here, the authors propose a universal thermodynamics-guided alloy design approach to assist the discovery of crack-free materials.",2022-07-27
1157,Differential neutralization and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 variants by antibodies elicited by COVID-19 mRNA vaccines,"The evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the emergence of new variant lineages that have exacerbated the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of those variants were designated as variants of concern/interest (VOC/VOI) by national or international authorities based on many factors including their potential impact on vaccine-mediated protection from disease. To ascertain and rank the risk of VOCs and VOIs, we analyze the ability of 14 variants (614G, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron) to escape from mRNA vaccine-induced antibodies. The variants show differential reductions in neutralization and replication by post-vaccination sera. Although the Omicron variant (BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2) shows the most escape from neutralization, sera collected after a third dose of vaccine (booster sera) retain moderate neutralizing activity against that variant. Therefore, vaccination remains an effective strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants raise concerns on immune evasion. Here, the authors evaluate the neutralization efficiency of COVID-19 mRNA vaccinee sera against representative viruses of 13 WHO-designated SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern/interest.",2022-07-27
1158,Decoding kinase-adverse event associations for small molecule kinase inhibitors,"Small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) are being approved at a fast pace under expedited programs for anticancer treatment. In this study, we construct a multi-domain dataset from a total of 4638 patients in the registrational trials of 16 FDA-approved SMKIs and employ a machine-learning model to examine the relationships between kinase targets and adverse events (AEs). Internal and external (datasets from two independent SMKIs) validations have been conducted to verify the usefulness of the established model. We systematically evaluate the potential associations between 442 kinases with 2145 AEs and made publicly accessible an interactive web application “Identification of Kinase-Specific Signal” (https://gongj.shinyapps.io/ml4ki). The developed model (1) provides a platform for experimentalists to identify and verify undiscovered KI-AE pairs, (2) serves as a precision-medicine tool to mitigate individual patient safety risks by forecasting clinical safety signals and (3) can function as a modern drug development tool to screen and compare SMKI target therapies from the safety perspective.","Small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) are being approved at a fast pace under expedited programs for anticancer treatment.

1159,Decoherence of V\({}_{{{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}}}^{-}\) spin defects in monoisotopic hexagonal boron nitride,"Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising quantum systems for the design of flexible two-dimensional quantum sensing platforms. Here we rely on hBN crystals isotopically enriched with either 10B or 11B to investigate the isotope-dependent properties of a spin defect featuring a broadband photoluminescence signal in the near infrared. By analyzing the hyperfine structure of the spin defect while changing the boron isotope, we first confirm that it corresponds to the negatively charged boron-vacancy center (\({{{{{{{{\rm{V}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}}}^{-}\)). We then show that its spin coherence properties are slightly improved in 10B-enriched samples. This is supported by numerical simulations employing cluster correlation expansion methods, which reveal the importance of the hyperfine Fermi contact term for calculating the coherence time of point defects in hBN. Using cross-relaxation spectroscopy, we finally identify dark electron spin impurities as an additional source of decoherence. This work provides new insights into the properties of \({{{{{{{{\rm{V}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}}}^{-}\) spin defects, which are valuable for the future development of hBN-based quantum sensing foils.","Recently, coherent control of spin defects in hBN has been realized, enabling future applications in quantum sensing technologies.

1160,Rare loss of function variants in the hepatokine gene INHBE protect from abdominal obesity,"Identifying genetic variants associated with lower waist-to-hip ratio can reveal new therapeutic targets for abdominal obesity. We use exome sequences from 362,679 individuals to identify genes associated with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), a surrogate for abdominal fat that is causally linked to type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. Predicted loss of function (pLOF) variants in INHBE associate with lower WHRadjBMI and this association replicates in data from AMP-T2D-GENES. INHBE encodes a secreted protein, the hepatokine activin E. In vitro characterization of the most common INHBE pLOF variant in our study, indicates an in-frame deletion resulting in a 90% reduction in secreted protein levels. We detect associations with lower WHRadjBMI for variants in ACVR1C, encoding an activin receptor, further highlighting the involvement of activins in regulating fat distribution. These findings highlight activin E as a potential therapeutic target for abdominal obesity, a phenotype linked to cardiometabolic disease.","Abdominal fat has been shown to increase cardiometabolic disease risk. In this study, the authors report that loss-of-function variants in the gene INHBE associate with lower BMI-adjusted waist-to-hip ratio, a surrogate measure of abdominal fat.",2022-07-27
1161,Overload wave-memory induces amnesia of a self-propelled particle,"Information storage is a key element of autonomous, out-of-equilibrium dynamics, especially for biological and synthetic active matter. In synthetic active matter however, the implementation of internal memory in self-propelled systems is often absent, limiting our understanding of memory-driven dynamics. Recently, a system comprised of a droplet generating its guiding wavefield appeared as a prime candidate for such investigations. Indeed, the wavefield, propelling the droplet, encodes information about the droplet trajectory and the amount of information can be controlled by a single scalar experimental parameter. In this work, we show numerically and experimentally that the accumulation of information in the wavefield induces the loss of time correlations, where the dynamics can then be described by a memory-less process. We rationalize the resulting statistical behavior by defining an effective temperature for the particle dynamics where the wavefield acts as a thermostat of large dimensions, and by evidencing a minimization principle of the generated wavefield.","Memory and information storage play an important role in biological systems, however challenging to implement in synthetic active matter. The authors show that the wave field, propelling the particle, acts as a memory repository, and an excess of memory leads to a memory-less particle dynamics.",2022-07-27
1162,Sustainable oxygen evolution electrocatalysis in aqueous 1 M H2SO4 with earth abundant nanostructured Co3O4,"Earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) able to work in acidic working conditions are elusive. While many first-row transition metal oxides are competitive in alkaline media, most of them just dissolve or become inactive at high proton concentrations where hydrogen evolution is preferred. Only noble-metal catalysts, such as IrO2, are fast and stable enough in acidic media. Herein, we report the excellent activity and long-term stability of Co3O4-based anodes in 1 M H2SO4 (pH 0.1) when processed in a partially hydrophobic carbon-based protecting matrix. These Co3O4@C composites reliably drive O2 evolution a 10 mA cm–2 current density for >40 h without appearance of performance fatigue, successfully passing benchmarking protocols without incorporating noble metals. Our strategy opens an alternative venue towards fast, energy efficient acid-media water oxidation electrodes.","While water electrolysis offers a renewable way to produce hydrogen, there are few Earth-abundant, acid-stable water oxidation catalysts.

1163,Real-time precision opto-control of chemical processes in live cells,"Precision control of molecular activities and chemical reactions in live cells is a long-sought capability by life scientists. No existing technology can probe molecular targets in cells and simultaneously control the activities of only these targets at high spatial precision. We develop a real-time precision opto-control (RPOC) technology that detects a chemical-specific optical response from molecular targets during laser scanning and uses the optical signal to couple a separate laser to only interact with these molecules without affecting other sample locations. We demonstrate precision control of molecular states of a photochromic molecule in different regions of the cells. We also synthesize a photoswitchable compound and use it with RPOC to achieve site-specific inhibition of microtubule polymerization and control of organelle dynamics in live cells. RPOC can automatically detect and control biomolecular activities and chemical processes in dynamic living samples with submicron spatial accuracy, fast response time, and high chemical specificity.","There is a need to control molecular activities at high spatial precision.

1164,The Cryo-EM structures of two amphibian antimicrobial cross-β amyloid fibrils,"The amyloid-antimicrobial link hypothesis is based on antimicrobial properties found in human amyloids involved in neurodegenerative and systemic diseases, along with amyloidal structural properties found in antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Supporting this hypothesis, we here determined the fibril structure of two AMPs from amphibians, uperin 3.5 and aurein 3.3, by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), revealing amyloid cross-β fibrils of mated β-sheets at atomic resolution. Uperin 3.5 formed a 3-blade symmetrical propeller of nine peptides per fibril layer including tight β-sheet interfaces. This cross-β cryo-EM structure complements the cross-α fibril conformation previously determined by crystallography, substantiating a secondary structure switch mechanism of uperin 3.5. The aurein 3.3 arrangement consisted of six peptides per fibril layer, all showing kinked β-sheets allowing a rounded compactness of the fibril. The kinked β-sheets are similar to LARKS (Low-complexity, Amyloid-like, Reversible, Kinked Segments) found in human functional amyloids.",In this work the authors provide high-resolution structural support for the amyloid-antimicrobial link via functional amyloids displaying propeller-like and kinked cross-β fibrils.,2022-07-27
1165,Cohesin couples transcriptional bursting probabilities of inducible enhancers and promoters,"Innate immune responses rely on inducible gene expression programmes which, in contrast to steady-state transcription, are highly dependent on cohesin. Here we address transcriptional parameters underlying this cohesin-dependence by single-molecule RNA-FISH and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that inducible innate immune genes are regulated predominantly by an increase in the probability of active transcription, and that probabilities of enhancer and promoter transcription are coordinated. Cohesin has no major impact on the fraction of transcribed inducible enhancers, or the number of mature mRNAs produced per transcribing cell. Cohesin is, however, required for coupling the probabilities of enhancer and promoter transcription. Enhancer-promoter coupling may not be explained by spatial proximity alone, and at the model locus Il12b can be disrupted by selective inhibition of the cohesinopathy-associated BET bromodomain BD2. Our data identify discrete steps in enhancer-mediated inducible gene expression that differ in cohesin-dependence, and suggest that cohesin and BD2 may act on shared pathways.","Here the authors show inducible genes and enhancers are regulated mainly by transcriptional burst frequency and that this is coordinated in single cells and individual alleles. Cohesin, which is important for inducible gene expression, is largely dispensable for regulating enhancer burst frequencies; however, it is required for coupling burst frequencies of inducible enhancers and promoters.",2022-07-27
1166,UV photonic integrated circuits for far-field structured illumination autofluorescence microscopy,"Ultra-violet (UV) light has still a limited scope in optical microscopy despite its potential advantages over visible light in terms of optical resolution and of interaction with a wide variety of biological molecules. The main challenge is to control in a robust, compact and cost-effective way UV light beams at the level of a single optical spatial mode and concomitantly to minimize the light propagation loss. To tackle this challenge, we present here photonic integrated circuits made of aluminum oxide thin layers that are compatible with both UV light and high-volume manufacturing. These photonic circuits designed at a wavelength of 360 nm enable super-resolved structured illumination microscopy with conventional wide-field microscopes and without modifying the usual protocol for handling the object to be imaged. As a biological application, we show that our UV photonic chips enable to image the autofluorescence of yeast cells and reveal features unresolved with standard wide-field microscopy.","Here, the authors develop a UV-compatible photonic integrated circuit for structured illumination microscopy on a conventional wide-field microscope. Operating at a wavelength of 360 nm, they generate switchable far-field fringe patterns, and demonstrate autofluorescence imaging of yeast cells.",2022-07-27
1167,Dirac-source diode with sub-unity ideality factor,"An increase in power consumption necessitates a low-power circuit technology to extend Moore’s law. Low-power transistors, such as tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs), negative-capacitance field-effect transistors (NC-FETs), and Dirac-source field-effect transistors (DS-FETs), have been realised to break the thermionic limit of the subthreshold swing (SS). However, a low-power rectifier, able to overcome the thermionic limit of an ideality factor (η) of 1 at room temperature, has not been proposed yet. In this study, we have realised a DS diode based on graphene/MoS2/graphite van der Waals heterostructures, which exhibits a steep-slope characteristic curve, by exploiting the linear density of states (DOSs) of graphene. For the developed DS diode, we obtained η < 1 for more than four decades of drain current (ηave_4dec < 1) with a minimum value of 0.8, and a rectifying ratio exceeding 108. The realisation of a DS diode represents an additional step towards the development of low-power electronic circuits.","While different types of low-power transistors have been investigated, low voltage rectifiers able to overcome the thermionic limit have not been proposed yet.

1168,Molecular mechanism of toxin neutralization in the HipBST toxin-antitoxin system of Legionella pneumophila,"Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous genetic modules in bacteria and archaea. Here, we perform structural and biochemical characterization of the Legionella pneumophila effector Lpg2370, demonstrating that it is a Ser/Thr kinase. Together with two upstream genes, lpg2370 constitutes the tripartite HipBST TA. Notably, the toxin Lpg2370 (HipTLp) and the antitoxin Lpg2369 (HipSLp) correspond to the C-terminus and N-terminus of HipA from HipBA TA, respectively. By determining crystal structures of autophosphorylated HipTLp, its complex with AMP-PNP, and the structure of HipTLp-HipSLp complex, we identify residues in HipTLp critical for ATP binding and those contributing to its interactions with HipSLp. Structural analysis reveals that HipSLp binding induces a loop-to-helix shift in the P-loop of HipTLp, leading to the blockage of ATP binding and inhibition of the kinase activity. These findings establish the L. pneumophila effector Lpg2370 as the HipBST TA toxin and elucidate the molecular basis for HipT neutralization in HipBST TA.","Here, the authors demonstrate that the Legionella pneumophila T4SS effector protein Lpg2370 is a Ser/Thr kinase and a toxin of a tripartite HipBST toxin-antitoxin (TA) system.

1169,Nonvolatile ferroelectric domain wall memory integrated on silicon,"Ferroelectric domain wall memories have been proposed as a promising candidate for nonvolatile memories, given their intriguing advantages including low energy consumption and high-density integration. Perovskite oxides possess superior ferroelectric prosperities but perovskite-based domain wall memory integrated on silicon has rarely been reported due to the technical challenges in the sample preparation. Here, we demonstrate a domain wall memory prototype utilizing freestanding BaTiO3 membranes transferred onto silicon. While as-grown BaTiO3 films on (001) SrTiO3 substrate are purely c-axis polarized, we find they exhibit distinct in-plane multidomain structures after released from the substrate and integrated onto silicon due to the collective effects from depolarizing field and strain relaxation. Based on the strong in-plane ferroelectricity, conductive domain walls with reading currents up to nanoampere are observed and can be both created and erased artificially, highlighting the great potential of the integration of perovskite oxides with silicon for ferroelectric domain wall memories.","Integrating ferroelectric perovskite oxides on Si is highly desired for electronic applications but challenging.

1170,Paeniclostridium sordellii hemorrhagic toxin targets TMPRSS2 to induce colonic epithelial lesions,"Hemorrhagic toxin (TcsH) is an important exotoxin produced by Paeniclostridium sordellii, but the exact role of TcsH in the pathogenesis remains unclear, partly due to the lack of knowledge of host receptor(s). Here, we carried out two genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens parallelly with TcsH and identified cell surface fucosylation and TMPRSS2 as host factors contributing to the binding and entry of TcsH. Genetic deletion of either fucosylation biosynthesis enzymes or TMPRSS2 in the cells confers resistance to TcsH intoxication. Interestingly, TMPRSS2 and fucosylated glycans can mediate the binding/entry of TcsH independently, thus serving as redundant receptors. Both TMPRSS2 and fucosylation recognize TcsH through its CROPs domain. By using Tmprss2‒/‒ mice, we show that Tmprss2 is important for TcsH-induced systematic toxicity and colonic epithelial lesions. These findings reveal the importance of TMPRSS2 and surface fucosylation in TcsH actions and further provide insights into host recognition mechanisms for large clostridial toxins.","Paeniclostridium sordellii is an opportunistic pathogen that can occur and be fatal in women undergoing abortion or childbirth.

1171,Tracing the origin of lithium in Li-ion batteries using lithium isotopes,"Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIB) play a key role in the energy transition towards clean energy, powering electric vehicles, storing energy on renewable grids, and helping to cut emissions from transportation and energy sectors. Lithium (Li) demand is estimated to increase considerably in the near future, due to the growing need for clean-energy technologies. The corollary is that consumer expectations will also grow in terms of guarantees on the origin of Li and the efforts made to reduce the environmental and social impact potentially associated with its extraction. Today, the LIB-industry supply chain is very complex, making it difficult for end users to ensure that Li comes from environmentally and responsible sources. Using an innovative geochemical approach based on the analysis of Li isotopes of raw and processed materials, we show that Li isotope ‘fingerprints’ are a useful tool for determining the origin of lithium in LIB. This sets the stage for a new method ensuring the certification of Li in LIB.",Rechargeable Li-ion batteries play a key role in the energy transition towards clean energy.

1172,Transcriptomic and proteomic retinal pigment epithelium signatures of age-related macular degeneration,"There are currently no treatments for geographic atrophy, the advanced form of age-related macular degeneration. Hence, innovative studies are needed to model this condition and prevent or delay its progression. Induced pluripotent stem cells generated from patients with geographic atrophy and healthy individuals were differentiated to retinal pigment epithelium. Integrating transcriptional profiles of 127,659 retinal pigment epithelium cells generated from 43 individuals with geographic atrophy and 36 controls with genotype data, we identify 445 expression quantitative trait loci in cis that are asssociated with disease status and specific to retinal pigment epithelium subpopulations. Transcriptomics and proteomics approaches identify molecular pathways significantly upregulated in geographic atrophy, including in mitochondrial functions, metabolic pathways and extracellular cellular matrix reorganization. Five significant protein quantitative trait loci that regulate protein expression in the retinal pigment epithelium and in geographic atrophy are identified - two of which share variants with cis- expression quantitative trait loci, including proteins involved in mitochondrial biology and neurodegeneration. Investigation of mitochondrial metabolism confirms mitochondrial dysfunction as a core constitutive difference of the retinal pigment epithelium from patients with geographic atrophy. This study uncovers important differences in retinal pigment epithelium homeostasis associated with geographic atrophy.","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss, and there is no approved treatment for AMD with geographic atrophy.

1173,Structural and mechanistic insights into the cleavage of clustered O-glycan patches-containing glycoproteins by mucinases of the human gut,"Mucinases of human gut bacteria cleave peptide bonds in mucins strictly depending on the presence of neighboring O-glycans. The Akkermansia muciniphila AM0627 mucinase cleaves specifically in between contiguous (bis) O-glycans of defined truncated structures, suggesting that this enzyme may recognize clustered O-glycan patches. Here, we report the structure and molecular mechanism of AM0627 in complex with a glycopeptide containing a bis-T (Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr) O-glycan, revealing that AM0627 recognizes both the sugar moieties and the peptide sequence. AM0627 exhibits preference for bis-T over bis-Tn (GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr) O-glycopeptide substrates, with the first GalNAc residue being essential for cleavage. AM0627 follows a mechanism relying on a nucleophilic water molecule and a catalytic base Glu residue. Structural comparison among mucinases identifies a conserved Tyr engaged in sugar-π interactions in both AM0627 and the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron BT4244 mucinase as responsible for the common activity of these two mucinases with bis-T/Tn substrates. Our work illustrates how mucinases through tremendous flexibility adapt to the diversity in distribution and patterns of O-glycans on mucins.","AM0627 is a bis-O-glycan mucinase that might work in the final steps of mucus degradation, thereby providing a carbon and nitrogen source for Akkermansia muciniphila. Here, the authors provide molecular insights into AM0627 function from X-ray crystallography and computer simulations.",2022-07-26
1174,An automated 13.5 hour system for scalable diagnosis and acute management guidance for genetic diseases,"While many genetic diseases have effective treatments, they frequently progress rapidly to severe morbidity or mortality if those treatments are not implemented immediately. Since front-line physicians frequently lack familiarity with these diseases, timely molecular diagnosis may not improve outcomes. Herein we describe Genome-to-Treatment, an automated, virtual system for genetic disease diagnosis and acute management guidance. Diagnosis is achieved in 13.5 h by expedited whole genome sequencing, with superior analytic performance for structural and copy number variants. An expert panel adjudicated the indications, contraindications, efficacy, and evidence-of-efficacy of 9911 drug, device, dietary, and surgical interventions for 563 severe, childhood, genetic diseases. The 421 (75%) diseases and 1527 (15%) effective interventions retained are integrated with 13 genetic disease information resources and appended to diagnostic reports (https://gtrx.radygenomiclab.com). This system provided correct diagnoses in four retrospectively and two prospectively tested infants. The Genome-to-Treatment system facilitates optimal outcomes in children with rapidly progressive genetic diseases.","Rapid diagnosis and implementation of treatments is crucial in many genetic conditions. Here the authors describe Genome-to-Treatment, a virtual disease management system that can achieve a rapid diagnosis by expedited whole genome sequencing in 13.5 hours and provide guidance to clinicians for possible therapies.",2022-07-26
1175,Reduction of primary graft dysfunction using cytokine adsorption during organ preservation and after lung transplantation,"Despite improvements, lung transplantation remains hampered by both a scarcity of donor organs and by mortality following primary graft dysfunction (PGD). Since acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) limits donor lungs utilization, we investigated cytokine adsorption as a means of treating ARDS donor lungs. We induced mild to moderate ARDS using lipopolysaccharide in 16 donor pigs. Lungs were then treated with or without cytokine adsorption during ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) and/or post-transplantation using extracorporeal hemoperfusion. The treatment significantly decreased cytokine levels during EVLP and decreased levels of immune cells post-transplantation. Histology demonstrated fewer signs of lung injury across both treatment periods and the incidence of PGD was significantly reduced among treated animals. Overall, cytokine adsorption was able to restore lung function and reduce PGD in lung transplantation. We suggest this treatment will increase the availability of donor lungs and increase the tolerability of donor lungs in the recipient.","Lung transplantation is hindered by the scarcity of organs and by mortality following primary graft dysfunction. Here, the authors show that cytokine absorption can be used in donor lungs during ex vivo lung perfusion and post-transplant, and leads to restored lung function and reduced primary graft dysfunction in animal models.",2022-07-26
1176,T cell receptor β-chain-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T cells against T cell malignancies,"The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in treating B cell malignancies comes at the price of eradicating normal B cells. Even though T cell malignancies are aggressive and treatment options are limited, similar strategies for T cell malignancies are constrained by the severe immune suppression arising from bystander T cell aplasia. Here, we show the selective killing of malignant T cells without affecting normal T cell-mediated immune responses in vitro and in a mouse model of disseminated leukemia. Further, we develop a CAR construct that carries the single chain variable fragment of a subtype-specific antibody against the variable TCR β-chain region. We demonstrate that these anti-Vβ8 CAR-T cells are able to recognize and kill all Vβ8+ malignant T cells that arise from clonal expansion while sparing malignant or healthy Vβ8− T cells, allowing sufficient T cell-mediated cellular immunity. In summary, we present a proof of concept for a selective CAR-T cell therapy to eradicate T cell malignancies while maintaining functional adaptive immunity, which opens the possibility for clinical development.","Healthy T cells are polyclonal, while malignant T cells are developing via clonal expansion. Here authors show that T cell tumours could be eradicated by chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting the T cell receptor (TCR) β-chain that is specific to malignant T cells, while healthy T cells using diverse TCR β-chains are spared.",2022-07-26
1177,Win-win opportunities combining high yields with high multi-taxa biodiversity in tropical agroforestry,"Resolving ecological-economic trade-offs between biodiversity and yields is a key challenge when addressing the biodiversity crisis in tropical agricultural landscapes. Here, we focused on the relation between seven different taxa (trees, herbaceous plants, birds, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and ants) and yields in vanilla agroforests in Madagascar. Agroforests established in forests supported overall 23% fewer species and 47% fewer endemic species than old-growth forests, and 14% fewer endemic species than forest fragments. In contrast, agroforests established on fallows had overall 12% more species and 38% more endemic species than fallows. While yields increased with vanilla vine density and length, non-yield related variables largely determined biodiversity. Nonetheless, trade-offs existed between yields and butterflies as well as  reptiles. Vanilla yields were generally unrelated to richness of trees, herbaceous plants, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and ants, opening up possibilities for conservation outside of protected areas and restoring degraded land to benefit farmers and biodiversity alike.","Resolving ecological-economic trade-offs is a challenge in agriculture. Here, Wurz et al. find that in Malagasy vanilla agroforests, vanilla yield is generally not related to tree, herbaceous plant, bird, amphibian, reptile and ant biodiversity, creating opportunities for conservation outside protected areas.",2022-07-26
1178,Plastic pollution fosters more microbial growth in lakes than natural organic matter,"Plastic debris widely pollutes freshwaters. Abiotic and biotic degradation of plastics releases carbon-based substrates that are available for heterotrophic growth, but little is known about how these novel organic compounds influence microbial metabolism. Here we found leachate from plastic shopping bags was chemically distinct and more bioavailable than natural organic matter from 29 Scandinavian lakes. Consequently, plastic leachate increased bacterial biomass acquisition by 2.29-times when added at an environmentally-relevant concentration to lake surface waters. These results were not solely attributable to the amount of dissolved organic carbon provided by the leachate. Bacterial growth was 1.72-times more efficient with plastic leachate because the added carbon was more accessible than natural organic matter. These effects varied with both the availability of alternate, especially labile, carbon sources and bacterial diversity. Together, our results suggest that plastic pollution may stimulate aquatic food webs and highlight where pollution mitigation strategies could be most effective.",Ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry revealed that plastic bags leach labile compounds. Bioassays performed in Scandinavian lakes indicated that these compounds are incorporated into biomass faster and more efficiently than natural organic matter.,2022-07-26
1179,Engineered bioorthogonal POLY-PROTAC nanoparticles for tumour-specific protein degradation and precise cancer therapy,"PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) has been exploited to degrade putative protein targets. However, the antitumor performance of PROTACs is impaired by their insufficient tumour distribution. Herein, we present de novo designed polymeric PROTAC (POLY-PROTAC) nanotherapeutics for tumour-specific protein degradation. The POLY-PROTACs are engineered by covalently grafting small molecular PROTACs onto the backbone of an amphiphilic diblock copolymer via the disulfide bonds. The POLY-PROTACs self-assemble into micellar nanoparticles and sequentially respond to extracellular matrix metalloproteinase-2, intracellular acidic and reductive tumour microenvironment. The POLY-PROTAC NPs are further functionalized with azide groups for bioorthogonal click reaction-amplified PROTAC delivery to the tumour tissue. For proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that tumour-specific BRD4 degradation with the bioorthogonal POLY-PROTAC nanoplatform combine with photodynamic therapy efficiently regress tumour xenografts in a mouse model of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer. This study suggests the potential of the POLY-PROTACs for precise protein degradation and PROTAC-based cancer therapy.","Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have emerged as promising cancer therapy agents but have suffered from systemic toxicity issues. Here, the authors report on the creation of polymeric PROTAC nanoparticles for tumour targeting delivery and demonstrate protein degradation in vivo, in combination with photodynamic therapy.",2022-07-26
1180,Shared mechanisms across the major psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases,"Several common psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases share epidemiologic risk; however, whether they share pathophysiology is unclear and is the focus of our investigation. Using 25 GWAS results and LD score regression, we find eight significant genetic correlations between psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. We integrate the GWAS results with human brain transcriptomes (n = 888) and proteomes (n = 722) to identify cis- and trans- transcripts and proteins that are consistent with a pleiotropic or causal role in each disease, referred to as causal proteins for brevity. Within each disease group, we find many distinct and shared causal proteins. Remarkably, 30% (13 of 42) of the neurodegenerative disease causal proteins are shared with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we find 2.6-fold more protein-protein interactions among the psychiatric and neurodegenerative causal proteins than expected by chance. Together, our findings suggest these psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases have shared genetic and molecular pathophysiology, which has important ramifications for early treatment and therapeutic development.","Studying the shared genetic etiology of disease can help improve diagnosis and treatment. Here, the authors find evidence for shared genetic and molecular pathophysiology between several common psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases using results of 25 GWAS and large-scale human brain transcriptomic and proteomic sequencing.",2022-07-26
1181,Cryo-EM structures of Na+-pumping NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae,"The Na+-pumping NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) couples electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone with Na+-pumping, generating an electrochemical Na+ gradient that is essential for energy-consuming reactions in bacteria. Since Na+-NQR is exclusively found in prokaryotes, it is a promising target for highly selective antibiotics. However, the molecular mechanism of inhibition is not well-understood for lack of the atomic structural information about an inhibitor-bound state. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of Na+-NQR from Vibrio cholerae with or without a bound inhibitor at 2.5- to 3.1-Å resolution. The structures reveal the arrangement of all six redox cofactors including a herein identified 2Fe-2S cluster located between the NqrD and NqrE subunits. A large part of the hydrophilic NqrF is barely visible in the density map, suggesting a high degree of flexibility. This flexibility may be responsible to reducing the long distance between the 2Fe-2S centers in NqrF and NqrD/E. Two different types of specific inhibitors bind to the N-terminal region of NqrB, which is disordered in the absence of inhibitors. The present study provides a foundation for understanding the function of Na+-NQR and the binding manner of specific inhibitors.","The Na+-pumping NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) is a unique respiratory enzyme found in many pathogenic bacteria. Here, the authors present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of Na+-NQR from V. cholerae with or without a bound inhibitor.",2022-07-26
1182,NGC1818 unveils the origin of the extended main-sequence turn-off in young Magellanic Clouds clusters,"The origin of young star clusters represents a major challenge for modern stellar astrophysics. While stellar rotation partially explains the colour spread observed along main-sequence turn-offs, i.e. where stars leave the main-sequence after the exhaustion of hydrogen in their core, and the multiple main sequences in the colour-magnitude diagrams of stellar systems younger than approximately 2 Gyr, it appears that an age difference may still be required to fulfill the observational constraints. Here we introduce an alternative approach that exploits the main-sequence turn-on, i.e. the point alongside the colour-magnitude diagram where pre-main-sequence stars join the main-sequence, to disentangle between the effects of stellar rotation and age to assess the presence, or lack thereof, of prolonged star formation in the approximately 40-Myr-old cluster NGC1818. Our results provide evidence for a fast star formation, confined within 8 Myr, thus excluding age differences as responsible for the extended main-sequence turn-offs, and leading the way to alternative observational perspectives in the exploration of stellar populations in young clusters.","The nature of young star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds is debated. Here, the authors show an alternative approach that exploits data to exclude the presence of age differences greater than a few million years among cluster stars in a very young cluster.",2022-07-26
1183,Global genomic analyses of wheat powdery mildew reveal association of pathogen spread with historical human migration and trade,"The fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici causes wheat powdery mildew disease. Here, we study its spread and evolution by analyzing a global sample of 172 mildew genomes. Our analyses show that B.g. tritici emerged in the Fertile Crescent during wheat domestication. After it spread throughout Eurasia, colonization brought it to America, where it hybridized with unknown grass mildew species. Recent trade brought USA strains to Japan, and European strains to China. In both places, they hybridized with local ancestral strains. Thus, although mildew spreads by wind regionally, our results indicate that humans drove its global spread throughout history and that mildew rapidly evolved through hybridization.","The fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici causes wheat powdery mildew disease.

1184,Aggregative trans-eQTL analysis detects trait-specific target gene sets in whole blood,"Large scale genetic association studies have identified many trait-associated variants and understanding the role of these variants in the downstream regulation of gene-expressions can uncover important mediating biological mechanisms. Here we propose ARCHIE, a summary statistic based sparse canonical correlation analysis method to identify sets of gene-expressions trans-regulated by sets of known trait-related genetic variants. Simulation studies show that compared to standard methods, ARCHIE is better suited to identify “core”-like genes through which effects of many other genes may be mediated and can capture disease-specific patterns of genetic associations. By applying ARCHIE to publicly available summary statistics from the eQTLGen consortium, we identify gene sets which have significant evidence of trans-association with groups of known genetic variants across 29 complex traits. Around half (50.7%) of the selected genes do not have any strong trans-associations and are not detected by standard methods. We provide further evidence for causal basis of the target genes through a series of follow-up analyses. These results show ARCHIE is a powerful tool for identifying sets of genes whose trans-regulation may be related to specific complex traits.","Large-scale genetic association studies have identified many trait-associated variants that influence gene expression.

1185,Targeting de novo lipogenesis and the Lands cycle induces ferroptosis in KRAS-mutant lung cancer,"Mutant KRAS (KM), the most common oncogene in lung cancer (LC), regulates fatty acid (FA) metabolism. However, the role of FA in LC tumorigenesis is still not sufficiently characterized. Here, we show that KMLC has a specific lipid profile, with high triacylglycerides and phosphatidylcholines (PC). We demonstrate that FASN, the rate-limiting enzyme in FA synthesis, while being dispensable in EGFR-mutant or wild-type KRAS LC, is required for the viability of KMLC cells. Integrating lipidomic, transcriptomic and functional analyses, we demonstrate that FASN provides saturated and monounsaturated FA to the Lands cycle, the process remodeling oxidized phospholipids, such as PC. Accordingly, blocking either FASN or the Lands cycle in KMLC, promotes ferroptosis, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)- and iron-dependent cell death, characterized by the intracellular accumulation of oxidation-prone PC. Our work indicates that KM dictates a dependency on newly synthesized FA to escape ferroptosis, establishing a targetable vulnerability in KMLC.","Mutant KRAS (KM) is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer and reported to promote lipid metabolism. Here, the authors show that fatty acid synthesis, which provides lipids to repair oxidized phospholipids through the FASN-Lands cycle axis, is a specific vulnerability for KM lung cancer.",2022-07-26
1186,K-point longitudinal acoustic phonons are responsible for ultrafast intervalley scattering in monolayer MoSe2,"In transition metal dichalcogenides, valley depolarization through intervalley carrier scattering by zone-edge phonons is often unavoidable. Although valley depolarization processes related to various acoustic phonons have been suggested, their optical verification is still vague due to nearly degenerate phonon frequencies on acoustic phonon branches at zone-edge momentums. Here we report an unambiguous phonon momentum determination of the longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons at the K point, which are responsible for the ultrafast valley depolarization in monolayer MoSe2. Using sub-10-fs-resolution pump-probe spectroscopy, we observed coherent phonons signals at both even and odd-orders of zone-edge LA mode involved in intervalley carrier scattering process. Our phonon-symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations reveal that only the LA phonon at the K point, as opposed to the M point, can produce experimental odd-order LA phonon signals from its nonlinear optical modulation. This work will provide momentum-resolved descriptions of phonon-carrier intervalley scattering processes in valleytronic materials.","Valley depolarization processes in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides have been linked to acoustic phonons, but optical verification is ambiguous, due to the nearly degenerate acoustic phonon frequencies at the zone-edge. Here, the authors determine the phonon momentum of the longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons at the K point as responsible for the ultrafast valley depolarization in monolayer MoSe2.",2022-07-25
1187,Tailoring thermal insulation architectures from additive manufacturing,"Tailoring thermal transport by structural parameters could result in mechanically fragile and brittle networks. An indispensable goal is to design hierarchical architecture materials that combine thermal and mechanical properties in a continuous and cohesive network. A promising strategy to create such a hierarchical network targets additive manufacturing of hybrid porous voxels at nanoscale. Here we describe the convergence of agile additive manufacturing of porous hybrid voxels to tailor hierarchically and mechanically tunable objects. In one strategy, the uniformly distributed porous silica voxels, which form the basis for the control of thermal transport, are non-covalently interfaced with polymeric networks, yielding hierarchic super-elastic architectures with thermal insulation properties. Another additive strategy for achieving mechanical strength involves the versatile orthogonal surface hybridization of porous silica voxels retains its low thermal conductivity of 19.1 mW m−1 K−1, flexible compressive recovery strain (85%), and tailored mechanical strength from 71.6 kPa to 1.5 MPa. The printed lightweight high-fidelity objects promise thermal aging mitigation for lithium-ion batteries, providing a thermal management pathway using 3D printed silica objects.","Nanoscale porous building blocks hold great promise for a range of thermal management technologies but often porous nanoparticle assemblies are intrinsically brittle. Here, the authors report 3D printing of porous silica voxels with polymeric additives to enable the coupling between additive manufacturing and hierarchical assembly for superior machinability and structural controllability.",2022-07-25
1188,Warming and redistribution of nitrogen inputs drive an increase in terrestrial nitrous oxide emission factor,"Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs cause major negative environmental impacts, including emissions of the important greenhouse gas N2O. Despite their importance, shifts in terrestrial N loss pathways driven by global change are highly uncertain. Here we present a coupled soil-atmosphere isotope model (IsoTONE) to quantify terrestrial N losses and N2O emission factors from 1850-2020. We find that N inputs from atmospheric deposition caused 51% of anthropogenic N2O emissions from soils in 2020. The mean effective global emission factor for N2O was 4.3 ± 0.3% in 2020 (weighted by N inputs), much higher than the surface area-weighted mean (1.1 ± 0.1%). Climate change and spatial redistribution of fertilisation N inputs have driven an increase in global emission factor over the past century, which accounts for 18% of the anthropogenic soil flux in 2020. Predicted increases in fertilisation in emerging economies will accelerate N2O-driven climate warming in coming decades, unless targeted mitigation measures are introduced.","Soil nitrogen isotopic composition is used to drive the IsoTONE model, which is constrained with measurements of tropospheric nitrous oxide isotopic composition. The model results reveal causes of rising mean global nitrous oxide emission factor.",2022-07-25
1189,Lead federated neuromorphic learning for wireless edge artificial intelligence,"In order to realize the full potential of wireless edge artificial intelligence (AI), very large and diverse datasets will often be required for energy-demanding model training on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper proposes a lead federated neuromorphic learning (LFNL) technique, which is a decentralized energy-efficient brain-inspired computing method based on spiking neural networks. The proposed technique will enable edge devices to exploit brain-like biophysiological structure to collaboratively train a global model while helping preserve privacy. Experimental results show that, under the situation of uneven dataset distribution among edge devices, LFNL achieves a comparable recognition accuracy to existing edge AI techniques, while substantially reducing data traffic by >3.5× and computational latency by >2.0×. Furthermore, LFNL significantly reduces energy consumption by >4.5× compared to standard federated learning with a slight accuracy loss up to 1.5%. Therefore, the proposed LFNL can facilitate the development of brain-inspired computing and edge AI.",Designing energy-efficient computing solution for the implementation of AI algorithms in edge devices remains a challenge.

1190,Regulated degradation of HMG CoA reductase requires conformational changes in sterol-sensing domain,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis and target of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs. Accumulation of sterols in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes accelerates degradation of HMGCR, slowing the synthesis of cholesterol. Degradation of HMGCR is inhibited by its binding to UBIAD1 (UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1). This inhibition contributes to statin-induced accumulation of HMGCR, which limits their cholesterol-lowering effects. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the HMGCR-UBIAD1 complex, which is maintained by interactions between transmembrane helix (TM) 7 of HMGCR and TMs 2–4 of UBIAD1. Disrupting this interface by mutagenesis prevents complex formation, enhancing HMGCR degradation. TMs 2–6 of HMGCR contain a 170-amino acid sterol sensing domain (SSD), which exists in two conformations—one of which is essential for degradation. Thus, our data supports a model that rearrangement of the TMs in the SSD permits recruitment of proteins that initate HMGCR degradation, a key reaction in the regulatory system that governs cholesterol synthesis.",HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) is regulated by UBIAD1 and Insigs and initializes cholesterol synthesis. Here authors show that the sterol sensing domain of HMGCR undergoes conformational changes to regulate its degradation via binding its protein modulators.,2022-07-25
1191,Active multiband varifocal metalenses based on orbital angular momentum division multiplexing,"Metalenses as miniature flat lenses exhibit a substantial potential in replacing traditional optical component. Although the metalenses have been intensively explored, their functions are limited by poor active ability, narrow operating band and small depth of field (DOF). Here, we show a dielectric metalens consisting of TiO2 nanofins array with ultrahigh aspect ratio to realize active multiband varifocal function. Regulating the orbital angular momentum (OAM) by the phase assignment covering the 2π range, its focal lengths can be switched from 5 mm to 35 mm. This active optical multiplexing uses the physical properties of OAM channels to selectively address and decode the vortex beams. The multiband capability and large DOFs with conversion efficiency of 49% for this metalens are validated for both 532 nm and 633 nm, and the incidence wavelength can further change the focal lengths. This non-mechanical tunable metalens demonstrates the possibility of active varifocal metalenses.","A dielectric metalens consisting of ultrahigh aspect ratio TiO2 nanofins array is demonstrated to realize active multiband varifocal functionality.

1192,Light-activated mitochondrial fission through optogenetic control of mitochondria-lysosome contacts,"Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles whose fragmentation by fission is critical to their functional integrity and cellular homeostasis. Here, we develop a method via optogenetic control of mitochondria–lysosome contacts (MLCs) to induce mitochondrial fission with spatiotemporal accuracy. MLCs can be achieved by blue-light-induced association of mitochondria and lysosomes through various photoactivatable dimerizers. Real-time optogenetic induction of mitochondrial fission is tracked in living cells to measure the fission rate. The optogenetic method partially restores the mitochondrial functions of SLC25A46−/− cells, which display defects in mitochondrial fission and hyperfused mitochondria. The optogenetic MLCs system thus provides a platform for studying mitochondrial fission and treating mitochondrial diseases.",Existing methods can lack spatiotemporal accuracy to manipulate dynamic mitochondrial behaviour in live cells. Here the authors report an optogenetic method to control mitochondria-lysosome contacts and induce mitochondrial fission; they use photoactivatable dimerizers including CRY2/CIB and SspB/iLID.,2022-07-25
1193,Dysfunctional ERG signaling drives pulmonary vascular aging and persistent fibrosis,"Vascular dysfunction is a hallmark of chronic diseases in elderly. The contribution of the vasculature to lung repair and fibrosis is not fully understood. Here, we performed an epigenetic and transcriptional analysis of lung endothelial cells (ECs) from young and aged mice during the resolution or progression of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We identified the transcription factor ETS-related gene (ERG) as putative orchestrator of lung capillary homeostasis and repair, and whose function is dysregulated in aging. ERG dysregulation is associated with reduced chromatin accessibility and maladaptive transcriptional responses to injury. Loss of endothelial ERG enhances paracrine fibroblast activation in vitro, and impairs lung fibrosis resolution in young mice in vivo. scRNA-seq of ERG deficient mouse lungs reveales transcriptional and fibrogenic abnormalities resembling those associated with aging and human lung fibrosis, including reduced number of general capillary (gCap) ECs. Our findings demonstrate that lung endothelial chromatin remodeling deteriorates with aging leading to abnormal transcription, vascular dysrepair, and persistent fibrosis following injury.","Vascular dysfunction is associated with ageing and chronic diseases, but its role in lung repair and fibrosis is unclear. Here, the authors show that the endothelial transcription factor ERG is a mediator of vascular repair whose function declines in aged lungs resulting in sustained fibrosis",2022-07-25
1194,Pancreatic tumor eradication via selective Pin1 inhibition in cancer-associated fibroblasts and T lymphocytes engagement,"Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) support tumors via multiple mechanisms, including maintaining the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and limiting infiltration of immune cells. The prolyl isomerase Pin1, whose overexpression in CAFs has not been fully profiled yet, plays critical roles in tumor initiation and progression. To decipher effects of selective Pin1 inhibition in CAFs on pancreatic cancer, here we formulate a DNA-barcoded micellular system (DMS) encapsulating the Pin1 inhibitor AG17724. DMS functionalized with CAF-targeting anti-FAP-α antibodies (antiCAFs-DMS) can selectively inhibit Pin1 in CAFs, leading to efficacious but transient tumor growth inhibition. We further integrate DNA aptamers (AptT), which can engage CD8+ T lymphocytes, to obtain a bispecific antiCAFs-DMS-AptT system. AntiCAFs-DMS-AptT inhibits tumor growth in subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer models.","Pharmacological inhibition of the prolyl isomerase PIN1, highly expressed in cancer cells and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF), has been proposed for cancer therapy.

1195,Length-dependent motions of SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting RNA pseudoknot and alternative conformations suggest avenues for frameshifting suppression,"The SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting element (FSE), a highly conserved mRNA region required for correct translation of viral polyproteins, defines an excellent therapeutic target against Covid-19. As discovered by our prior graph-theory analysis with SHAPE experiments, the FSE adopts a heterogeneous, length-dependent conformational landscape consisting of an assumed 3-stem H-type pseudoknot (graph motif 3_6), and two alternative motifs (3_3 and 3_5). Here, for the first time, we build and simulate, by microsecond molecular dynamics, 30 models for all three motifs plus motif-stabilizing mutants at different lengths. Our 3_6 pseudoknot systems, which agree with experimental structures, reveal interconvertible L and linear conformations likely related to ribosomal pausing and frameshifting. The 3_6 mutant inhibits this transformation and could hamper frameshifting. Our 3_3 systems exhibit length-dependent stem interactions that point to a potential transition pathway connecting the three motifs during ribosomal elongation. Together, our observations provide new insights into frameshifting mechanisms and anti-viral strategies.","Modeling the SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting RNA element (FSE), a drug target against Covid-19, the authors analyze the dynamics of three FSE conformations at different lengths to propose a conformational transition pathway and describe anti-viral strategies.",2022-07-25
1196,Noise correlations in neural ensemble activity limit the accuracy of hippocampal spatial representations,"Neurons in the CA1 area of the mouse hippocampus encode the position of the animal in an environment. However, given the variability in individual neurons responses, the accuracy of this code is still poorly understood. It was proposed that downstream areas could achieve high spatial accuracy by integrating the activity of thousands of neurons, but theoretical studies point to shared fluctuations in the firing rate as a potential limitation. Using high-throughput calcium imaging in freely moving mice, we demonstrated the limiting factors in the accuracy of the CA1 spatial code. We found that noise correlations in the hippocampus bound the estimation error of spatial coding to ~10 cm (the size of a mouse). Maximal accuracy was obtained using approximately [300–1400] neurons, depending on the animal. These findings reveal intrinsic limits in the brain’s representations of space and suggest that single neurons downstream of the hippocampus can extract maximal spatial information from several hundred inputs.","CA1 neurons encode an animal's position within the environment. Here the authors identified in hippocampal neuronal activity a detrimental type of noise that limits accuracy of spatial position, relative to body size.",2022-07-25
1197,Structure and assembly of cargo Rubisco in two native α-carboxysomes,"Carboxysomes are a family of bacterial microcompartments in cyanobacteria and chemoautotrophs. They encapsulate Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and carbonic anhydrase catalyzing carbon fixation inside a proteinaceous shell. How Rubisco complexes pack within the carboxysomes is unknown. Using cryo-electron tomography, we determine the distinct 3D organization of Rubisco inside two distant α-carboxysomes from a marine α-cyanobacterium Cyanobium sp. PCC 7001 where Rubiscos are organized in three concentric layers, and from a chemoautotrophic bacterium Halothiobacillus neapolitanus where they form intertwining spirals. We further resolve the structures of native Rubisco as well as its higher-order assembly at near-atomic resolutions by subtomogram averaging. The structures surprisingly reveal that the authentic intrinsically disordered linker protein CsoS2 interacts with Rubiscos in native carboxysomes but functions distinctively in the two α-carboxysomes. In contrast to the uniform Rubisco-CsoS2 association in the Cyanobium α-carboxysome, CsoS2 binds only to the Rubiscos close to the shell in the Halo α-carboxysome. Our findings provide critical knowledge of the assembly principles of α-carboxysomes, which may aid in the rational design and repurposing of carboxysome structures for new functions.","Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments encapsulating Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase for carbon fixation. Here, authors determine the organization of Rubisco and its interaction with the linker protein CsoS2 within two distant α-carboxysomes.",2022-07-25
1198,Sunlight-driven nitrate loss records Antarctic surface mass balance,"Standard proxies for reconstructing surface mass balance (SMB) in Antarctic ice cores are often inaccurate or coarsely resolved when applied to more complicated environments away from dome summits. Here, we propose an alternative SMB proxy based on photolytic fractionation of nitrogen isotopes in nitrate observed at 114 sites throughout East Antarctica. Applying this proxy approach to nitrate in a shallow core drilled at a moderate SMB site (Aurora Basin North), we reconstruct 700 years of SMB changes that agree well with changes estimated from ice core density and upstream surface topography. For the under-sampled transition zones between dome summits and the coast, we show that this proxy can provide past and present SMB values that reflect the immediate local environment and are derived independently from existing techniques.",Snow accumulation rates in Antarctica can now be reconstructed from nitrate isotopes in snow and ice. This independent technique offers scientists a new tool for studying how Antarctic climate changed in the past and how it may change in the future.,2022-07-25
1199,DNA nicks induce mutational signatures associated with BRCA1 deficiency,"Analysis of human cancer genome sequences has revealed specific mutational signatures associated with BRCA1-deficient tumors, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that one-ended DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) converted from CRISPR/Cas9-induced nicks by DNA replication, not two-ended DSBs, cause more characteristic chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in Brca1-deficient cells than in wild-type cells. BRCA1 is required for efficient homologous recombination of these nick-converted DSBs and suppresses bias towards long tract gene conversion and tandem duplication (TD) mediated by two-round strand invasion in a replication strand asymmetry. However, aberrant repair of these nick-converted one-ended DSBs, not that of two-ended DSBs in Brca1-deficient cells, generates mutational signatures such as small indels with microhomology (MH) at the junctions, translocations and small MH-mediated TDs, resembling those in BRCA1-deficient tumors. These results suggest a major contribution of DNA nicks to mutational signatures associated with BRCA1 deficiency in cancer and the underlying mechanisms.","It remains unclear how BRCA1-associated mutational sigantures are generated in cancer. Here, the authors develop nCas9-based approaches to uncover that aberrant repair of one-ended DSBs converted from DNA nicks by replication, not that of two-ended DSBs, induces such mutational signatures.",2022-07-25
1200,Therapeutic targeting of ATR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma,"Despite advances in multi-modal treatment approaches, clinical outcomes of patients suffering from PAX3-FOXO1 fusion oncogene-expressing alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) remain dismal. Here we show that PAX3-FOXO1-expressing ARMS cells are sensitive to pharmacological ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein (ATR) inhibition. Expression of PAX3-FOXO1 in muscle progenitor cells is not only sufficient to increase sensitivity to ATR inhibition, but PAX3-FOXO1-expressing rhabdomyosarcoma cells also exhibit increased sensitivity to structurally diverse inhibitors of ATR. Mechanistically, ATR inhibition leads to replication stress exacerbation, decreased BRCA1 phosphorylation and reduced homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair pathway activity. Consequently, ATR inhibitor treatment increases sensitivity of ARMS cells to PARP1 inhibition in vitro, and combined treatment with ATR and PARP1 inhibitors induces complete regression of primary patient-derived ARMS xenografts in vivo. Lastly, a genome-wide CRISPR activation screen (CRISPRa) in combination with transcriptional analyses of ATR inhibitor resistant ARMS cells identifies the RAS-MAPK pathway and its targets, the FOS gene family, as inducers of resistance to ATR inhibition. Our findings provide a rationale for upcoming biomarker-driven clinical trials of ATR inhibitors in patients suffering from ARMS.",Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is a clinically challenging disease due to the lack of druggable targets. Here the authors show preclinical evidence for ATR inhibitors as a therapeutic option for alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.,2022-07-25
1201,Revisiting stress-corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement in 7xxx-Al alloys at the near-atomic-scale,"The high-strength 7xxx series aluminium alloys can fulfil the need for light, high strength materials necessary to reduce carbon-emissions, and are extensively used in aerospace for weight reduction purposes. However, as all major high-strength materials, these alloys can be sensitive to stress-corrosion cracking (SCC) through anodic dissolution and hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Here, we study at the near-atomic-scale the intra- and inter-granular microstructure ahead and in the wake of a propagating SCC crack. Moving away from model alloys and non-industry standard tests, we perform a double cantilever beam (DCB) crack growth test on an engineering 7xxx Al-alloy. H is found segregated to planar arrays of dislocations and to grain boundaries that we can associate to the combined effects of hydrogen-enhanced localised plasticity (HELP) and hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) mechanisms. We report on a Mg-rich amorphous hydroxide on the corroded crack surface and evidence of Mg-related diffusional processes leading to dissolution of the strengthening η-phase precipitates ahead of the crack.","High-strength Al alloys are sensitive to stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement that limit their applications. Here the authors examine them at near-atomic scale using advanced microscopy and reveal hydrogen at dislocations and grain boundaries, and subsequent microstructural changes.",2022-07-25
1202,The RalGAPα1–RalA signal module protects cardiac function through regulating calcium homeostasis,"Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase SERCA2 mediates calcium re-uptake from the cytosol into sarcoplasmic reticulum, and its dysfunction is a hallmark of heart failure. Multiple factors have been identified to modulate SERCA2 activity, however, its regulation is still not fully understood. Here we identify a Ral-GTPase activating protein RalGAPα1 as a critical regulator of SERCA2 in cardiomyocytes through its downstream target RalA. RalGAPα1 is induced by pressure overload, and its deficiency causes cardiac dysfunction and exacerbates pressure overload-induced heart failure. Mechanistically, RalGAPα1 regulates SERCA2 through direct interaction and its target RalA. Deletion of RalGAPα1 decreases SERCA2 activity and prolongs calcium re-uptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum. GDP-bound RalA, but not GTP-bound RalA, binds to SERCA2 and activates the pump for sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium re-uptake. Overexpression of a GDP-bound RalAS28N mutant in the heart preserves cardiac function in a mouse model of heart failure. Our findings have therapeutic implications for treatment of heart failure.","Here the authors show that a RalGAPα1-RalA signal nexus regulates calcium homeostasis in cardiomyocytes via the calcium pump SERCA2a, which plays a protective role to maintain cardiac function under pressure overload conditions.",2022-07-25
1203,Decrease in air-sea CO2 fluxes caused by persistent marine heatwaves,"Regional processes play a key role in the global carbon budget. Major ocean CO2 uptake at mid-latitudes counteracts CO2 release in the tropics, which is modulated by episodes of marine heatwaves. Yet, we lack essential knowledge on persistent marine heatwaves, and their effect on the CO2 sensitive areas. Here we show, using a 1985–2017 joint analysis of reconstructions, ocean reanalysis and in situ and satellite data, that persistent marine heatwaves occur in major CO2 uptake and release areas. Average air-sea CO2 flux density changes from persistent marine heatwaves are strongest in the Pacific Ocean with a 40 ± 9% reduction in CO2 release in the tropics linked to ENSO, and a reduction in CO2 uptake of 29 ± 11% in the North Pacific over the study period. These results provide new insights into the interplay of extreme variability and a critical regulating ocean ecosystem service, and pave the way for future investigations on its evolution under climate change.","Ocean CO2 uptake at mid-latitudes counteracts CO2 release in the tropics, but we know little about the effects of marine heatwaves that modulate this process. Here, the authors use joint analysis of satellite measurements, in situ observation, reconstructions derived from machine learning algorithms, numerical model of the global ocean, and find that areas where PMHWs most frequently occur coincide with the regions that are the most critical for the oceanic carbon cycle.",2022-07-25
1204,Extreme purifying selection against point mutations in the human genome,"Large-scale genome sequencing has enabled the measurement of strong purifying selection in protein-coding genes. Here we describe a new method, called ExtRaINSIGHT, for measuring such selection in noncoding as well as coding regions of the human genome. ExtRaINSIGHT estimates the prevalence of “ultraselection” by the fractional depletion of rare single-nucleotide variants, after controlling for variation in mutation rates. Applying ExtRaINSIGHT to 71,702 whole genome sequences from gnomAD v3, we find abundant ultraselection in evolutionarily ancient miRNAs and neuronal protein-coding genes, as well as at splice sites. By contrast, we find much less ultraselection in other noncoding RNAs and transcription factor binding sites, and only modest levels in ultraconserved elements. We estimate that ~0.4–0.7% of the human genome is ultraselected, implying ~ 0.26–0.51 strongly deleterious mutations per generation. Overall, our study sheds new light on the genome-wide distribution of fitness effects by combining deep sequencing data and classical theory from population genetics.","Previous work has investigated selection in the coding genome, but it is not as well characterized in the non-coding genome. By analyzing rare variants in 70k genome sequences from gnomAD, the authors detect very strong purifying selection (""ultraselection”) across the human genome, finding it in some microRNAs and coding sequences but generally rare in regulatory sequences.",2022-07-25
1205,Phenylalanine impairs insulin signaling and inhibits glucose uptake through modification of IRβ,"Whether amino acids act on cellular insulin signaling remains unclear, given that increased circulating amino acid levels are associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we report that phenylalanine modifies insulin receptor beta (IRβ) and inactivates insulin signaling and glucose uptake. Mice fed phenylalanine-rich chow or phenylalanine-producing aspartame or overexpressing human phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (hFARS) develop insulin resistance and T2D symptoms. Mechanistically, FARS phenylalanylate lysine 1057/1079 of IRβ (F-K1057/1079), inactivating IRβ and preventing insulin from promoting glucose uptake by cells. SIRT1 reverse F-K1057/1079 and counteract the insulin-inactivating effects of hFARS and phenylalanine. F-K1057/1079 and SIRT1 levels in white blood cells from T2D patients are positively and negatively correlated with T2D onset, respectively. Blocking F-K1057/1079 with phenylalaninol sensitizes insulin signaling and relieves T2D symptoms in hFARS-transgenic and db/db mice. These findings shed light on the activation of insulin signaling and T2D progression through inhibition of phenylalanylation.","Whether amino acids act on cellular insulin signaling remains unclear. Here, the authors find that phenylalanine modifies insulin receptor beta (IRβ) and inactivates insulin signaling and glucose uptake and positively correlated with T2D onset.",2022-07-25
1206,Carbodefluorination of fluoroalkyl ketones via a carbene-initiated rearrangement strategy,"The C–F bond cleavage and C–C bond formation (i.e., carbodefluorination) of readily accessible (per)fluoroalkyl groups constitutes an atom-economical and efficient route to partially fluorinated compounds. However, the selective mono-carbodefluorination of trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups remains a challenge, due to the notorious inertness of C–F bond and the risk of over-defluorination arising from C–F bond strength decrease as the defluorination proceeds. Herein, we report a carbene-initiated rearrangement strategy for the carbodefluorination of fluoroalkyl ketones with β,γ-unsaturated alcohols to provide skeletally and functionally diverse α-mono- and α,α-difluoro-γ,δ-unsaturated ketones. The reaction starts with the formation of silver carbenes from fluoroalkyl N-triftosylhydrazones, followed by nucleophilic attack of a β,γ-unsaturated alcohol to form key silver-coordinated oxonium ylide intermediates, which triggers selective C–F bond cleavage by HF elimination and C–C bond formation through Claisen rearrangement of in situ generated difluorovinyl ether. The origin of chemoselectivity and the reaction mechanism are determined by experimental and DFT calculations. Collectively, this strategy by an intramolecular cascade process offers significant advances over existing stepwise strategies in terms of selectivity, efficiency, functional group tolerance, etc.",The selective functionalization of trifluoromethyl groups is challenging due to the inertness of the C–F bonds. Here the authors report a method for the carbodefluorination of C–F bonds of fluoroalkyl ketones via a carbene-initiated rearrangement strategy.,2022-07-25
1207,Maternal SMCHD1 regulates Hox gene expression and patterning in the mouse embryo,"Parents transmit genetic and epigenetic information to their offspring. Maternal effect genes regulate the offspring epigenome to ensure normal development. Here we report that the epigenetic regulator SMCHD1 has a maternal effect on Hox gene expression and skeletal patterning. Maternal SMCHD1, present in the oocyte and preimplantation embryo, prevents precocious activation of Hox genes post-implantation. Without maternal SMCHD1, highly penetrant posterior homeotic transformations occur in the embryo. Hox genes are decorated with Polycomb marks H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 from the oocyte throughout early embryonic development; however, loss of maternal SMCHD1 does not deplete these marks. Therefore, we propose maternal SMCHD1 acts downstream of Polycomb marks to establish a chromatin state necessary for persistent epigenetic silencing and appropriate Hox gene expression later in the developing embryo. This is a striking role for maternal SMCHD1 in long-lived epigenetic effects impacting offspring phenotype.","Parents transmit both genetic and epigenetic information to their offspring, with maternal effect genes being critical regulators of the offspring epigenome. Here they show that maternally deposited SMCHD1 has long-lasting effects on Hox gene expression and vertebral patterning during post-implantation development.",2022-07-25
1208,KSTAR: An algorithm to predict patient-specific kinase activities from phosphoproteomic data,"Kinase inhibitors as targeted therapies have played an important role in improving cancer outcomes. However, there are still considerable challenges, such as resistance, non-response, patient stratification, polypharmacology, and identifying combination therapy where understanding a tumor kinase activity profile could be transformative. Here, we develop a graph- and statistics-based algorithm, called KSTAR, to convert phosphoproteomic measurements of cells and tissues into a kinase activity score that is generalizable and useful for clinical pipelines, requiring no quantification of the phosphorylation sites. In this work, we demonstrate that KSTAR reliably captures expected kinase activity differences across different tissues and stimulation contexts, allows for the direct comparison of samples from independent experiments, and is robust across a wide range of dataset sizes. Finally, we apply KSTAR to clinical breast cancer phosphoproteomic data and find that there is potential for kinase activity inference from KSTAR to complement the current clinical diagnosis of HER2 status in breast cancer patients.","Kinases are important drug targets, but predicting their activities from phosphoproteomics data remains challenging. While many existing prediction tools rely on phosphosite-specific quantitative data, Crowl et al. develop a kinase activity prediction algorithm that requires no phosphosite quantification.",2022-07-25
1209,Limited influence of irrigation on pre-monsoon heat stress in the Indo-Gangetic Plain,"Hot extremes are anticipated to be more frequent and more intense under climate change, making the Indo-Gangetic Plain of India, with a 400 million population, vulnerable to heat stress. Recent studies suggest that irrigation has significant cooling and moistening effects over this region. While large-scale irrigation is prevalent in the Indo-Gangetic Plain during the two major cropping seasons, Kharif (Jun-Sep) and Rabi (Nov-Feb), hot extremes are reported in the pre-monsoon months (Apr-May) when irrigation activities are minimal. Here, using observed irrigation data and regional climate model simulations, we show that irrigation effects on heat stress during pre-monsoon are 4.9 times overestimated with model-simulated irrigation as prescribed in previous studies. We find that irrigation increases relative humidity by only 2.5%, indicating that irrigation is a non-crucial factor enhancing the moist heat stress. On the other hand, we detect causal effects of aerosol abundance on the daytime land surface temperature. Our study highlights the need to consider actual irrigation data in testing model-driven hypotheses related to the land-atmosphere feedback driven by human water management.","Pre-monsoon irrigation over the Indo-Gangetic Plain is often misrepresented in model-driven hypothesis. Using actual census-based data and realistic model simulations, the authors show that irrigation has limited role in enhancing heat stress in the region.",2022-07-25
1210,Integrin α3β1 promotes vessel formation of glioblastoma-associated endothelial cells through calcium-mediated macropinocytosis and lysosomal exocytosis,"Therapeutic targeting of angiogenesis in glioblastoma has yielded mixed outcomes. Investigation of tumor-associated angiogenesis has focused on the factors that stimulate the sprouting, migration, and hyperproliferation of the endothelial cells. However, little is known regarding the processes underlying the formation of the tumor-associated vessels. To address this issue, we investigated vessel formation in CD31+ cells isolated from human glioblastoma tumors. The results indicate that overexpression of integrin α3β1 plays a central role in the promotion of tube formation in the tumor-associated endothelial cells in glioblastoma. Blocking α3β1 function reduced sprout and tube formation in the tumor-associated endothelial cells and vessel density in organotypic cultures of glioblastoma. The data further suggest a mechanistic model in which integrin α3β1-promoted calcium influx stimulates macropinocytosis and directed maturation of the macropinosomes in a manner that promotes lysosomal exocytosis during nascent lumen formation. Altogether, our data indicate that integrin α3β1 may be a therapeutic target on the glioblastoma vasculature.",Tumour-associated angiogenesis facilitates the growth of tumours. Here the authors show that integrin α3β1 promotes blood vessel formation in glioblastoma through calcium-mediated macropinocytosis and lysosomal exocytosis.,2022-07-25
1211,Single-cell transcriptome atlas of the human corpus cavernosum,"The corpus cavernosum is the most important structure for penile erection, and its dysfunction causes many physiological and psychological problems. However, its cellular heterogeneity and signalling networks at the molecular level are poorly understood because of limited access to samples. Here, we profile 64,993 human cavernosal single-cell transcriptomes from three males with normal erection and five organic erectile dysfunction patients. Cell communication analysis reveals that cavernosal fibroblasts are central to the paracrine signalling network and regulate microenvironmental homeostasis. Combining with immunohistochemical staining, we reveal the cellular heterogeneity and describe a detailed spatial distribution map for each fibroblast, smooth muscle and endothelial subcluster in the corpus cavernosum. Furthermore, comparative analysis and related functional experiments identify candidate regulatory signalling pathways in the pathological process. Our study provides an insight into the human corpus cavernosum microenvironment and a reference for potential erectile dysfunction therapies.","The corpus cavernosum is the most important structure for penile erection, and its dysfunction causes physiological and psychological problems. Here the authors perform single-cell RNA-sequencing on corpus cavernosum samples from males with normal erection and erectile dysfunction patients, providing insights into this pathology.",2022-07-25
1212,A facile way to construct sensor array library via supramolecular chemistry for discriminating complex systems,"Differential sensing, which discriminates analytes via pattern recognition by sensor arrays, plays an important role in our understanding of many chemical and biological systems. However, it remains challenging to develop new methods to build a sensor unit library without incurring a high workload of synthesis. Herein, we propose a supramolecular approach to construct a sensor unit library by taking full advantage of recognition and assembly. Ten sensor arrays are developed by replacing the building block combinations, adjusting the ratio between system components, and changing the environment. Using proteins as model analytes, we examine the discriminative abilities of these supramolecular sensor arrays. Then the practical applicability for discriminating complex analytes is further demonstrated using honey as an example. This sensor array construction strategy is simple, tunable, and capable of developing many sensor units with as few syntheses as possible.","The development of sensor unit libraries that require minimal synthetic effort is challenging. Here, the authors report the preparation of sensor array libraries based on a supramolecular approach that relies on the recognition and assembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles.",2022-07-25
1213,"Spatial tomography of light resolved in time, spectrum, and polarisation","Measuring polarisation, spectrum, temporal dynamics, and spatial complex amplitude of optical beams is essential to studying phenomena in laser dynamics, telecommunications and nonlinear optics. Current characterisation techniques apply in limited contexts. Non-interferometric methods struggle to distinguish spatial phase, while phase-sensitive approaches necessitate either an auxiliary reference source or a self-reference, neither of which is universally available. Deciphering complex wavefronts of multiple co-propagating incoherent fields remains particularly challenging. We harness principles of spatial state tomography to circumvent these limitations and measure a complete description of an unknown beam as a set of spectrally, temporally, and polarisation resolved spatial state density matrices. Each density matrix slice resolves the spatial complex amplitude of multiple mutually incoherent fields, which over several slices reveals the spectral or temporal evolution of these fields even when fields spectrally or temporally overlap. We demonstrate these features by characterising the spatiotemporal and spatiospectral output of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser.","The work harnesses principles of spatial state tomography to fully characterise an optical beam in space, time, spectrum, and polarisation. Analysis of the output of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser illustrates the technique’s capabilities.",2022-07-25
1214,Lymphatic-preserving treatment sequencing with immune checkpoint inhibition unleashes cDC1-dependent antitumor immunity in HNSCC,"Despite the promise of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI), therapeutic responses remain limited. This raises the possibility that standard of care treatments delivered in concert may compromise the tumor response. To address this, we employ tobacco-signature head and neck squamous cell carcinoma murine models in which we map tumor-draining lymphatics and develop models for regional lymphablation with surgery or radiation. We find that lymphablation eliminates the tumor ICI response, worsening overall survival and repolarizing the tumor- and peripheral-immune compartments. Mechanistically, within tumor-draining lymphatics, we observe an upregulation of conventional type I dendritic cells and type I interferon signaling and show that both are necessary for the ICI response and lost with lymphablation. Ultimately, we provide a mechanistic understanding of how standard oncologic therapies targeting regional lymphatics impact the tumor response to immune-oncology therapy in order to define rational, lymphatic-preserving treatment sequences that mobilize systemic antitumor immunity, achieve optimal tumor responses, control regional metastatic disease, and confer durable antitumor immunity.","Response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remain low. Here the authors show that ablative treatment of tumor-draining regional lymphatics, a standard of care approach in patients, impairs the tumor response to ICI in preclinical HNSCC models.",2022-07-25
1215,The architecture of kinesin-3 KLP-6 reveals a multilevel-lockdown mechanism for autoinhibition,"Autoinhibition of kinesin-3 ensures the proper spatiotemporal control of the motor activity for intracellular transport, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we determine the full-length structure of kinesin-3 KLP-6 in a compact self-folded state. Unexpectedly, all the internal coiled-coil segments and domains in KLP-6 cooperate to successively lock down the neck and motor domains. The first coiled-coil segment is melted into several short helices that work with the motor domain to restrain the entire neck domain. The second coiled-coil segment associates with its neighboring FHA and MBS domains and integrates with the tail MATH domain to form a supramodule that synergistically wraps around the motor domain to trap the nucleotide and hinder the microtubule binding. This multilevel-lockdown mechanism for autoinhibition could be applicable to other kinesin-3 motors.","Autoinhibition ensures the proper spatiotemporal control of the kinesin-3 motor activity. Here, the authors present the full-length structure of kinesin-3 KLP-6 in an autoinhibited state and observe that all the internal domains entwine around the motor domain via a multilevel-lockdown mechanism.",2022-07-25
1216,Multi-step screening of DNA/lipid nanoparticles and co-delivery with siRNA to enhance and prolong gene expression,"Lipid nanoparticles hold great potential as an effective non-viral vector for nucleic acid-based gene therapy. Plasmid DNA delivery can result in extended transgene expression compared to mRNA-based technologies, yet there is a lack of systematic investigation into lipid nanoparticle compositions for plasmid DNA delivery. Here, we report a multi-step screening platform to identify optimized plasmid DNA lipid nanoparticles for liver-targeted transgene expression. To achieve this, we analyze the role of different helper lipids and component ratios in plasmid DNA lipid nanoparticle-mediated gene delivery in vitro and in vivo. Compared to mRNA LNPs and in vivo-jetPEI/DNA nanoparticles, the identified plasmid DNA lipid nanoparticles successfully deliver transgenes and mediate prolonged expression in the liver following intravenous administration in mice. By addressing different physiological barriers in a stepwise manner, this screening platform can efficiently down select effective lipid nanoparticle candidates from a lipid nanoparticle library of over 1000 formulations. In addition, we substantially extend the duration of plasmid DNA nanoparticle-mediated transgene expression using a DNA/siRNA co-delivery approach that targets transcription factors regulating inflammatory response pathways. This lipid nanoparticle-based co-delivery strategy further highlights the unique advantages of an extended transgene expression profile using plasmid DNA delivery and offers new opportunities for DNA-based gene medicine applications.","Plasmid DNA offers extended transgene expression duration compared to mRNA technologies. Here, using a multi-step screening platform, the authors report the best performing nanoparticle formulations for liver-targeted plasmid DNA expression in vivo.",2022-07-25
1217,Structural basis of human TREX1 DNA degradation and autoimmune disease,"TREX1 is a cytosolic DNA nuclease essential for regulation of cGAS-STING immune signaling. Existing structures of mouse TREX1 establish a mechanism of DNA degradation and provide a key model to explain autoimmune disease, but these structures incompletely explain human disease-associated mutations and have limited ability to guide development of small-molecule therapeutics. Here we determine crystal structures of human TREX1 in apo and DNA-bound conformations that provide high-resolution detail of all human-specific features. A 1.25 Å structure of human TREX1 establishes a complete model of solvation of the exonuclease active site and a 2.2 Å structure of the human TREX1–DNA complex enables identification of specific substitutions involved in DNA recognition. We map each TREX1 mutation associated with autoimmune disease and establish distinct categories of substitutions predicted to impact enzymatic function, protein stability, and interaction with cGAS-DNA liquid droplets. Our results explain how human-specific substitutions regulate TREX1 function and provide a foundation for structure-guided design of TREX1 therapeutics.","TREX1 is a cytosolic DNA nuclease and the genetic mutations of it are linked to autoimmune diseases.

1218,Competing electronic states emerging on polar surfaces,"Excess charge on polar surfaces of ionic compounds is commonly described by the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) model, a homogeneous distribution of charge, spatially-confined in a few atomic layers. Here, by combining scanning probe microscopy with density functional theory calculations, we show that excess charge on the polar TaO2 termination of KTaO3(001) forms more complex electronic states with different degrees of spatial and electronic localization: charge density waves (CDW) coexist with strongly-localized electron polarons and bipolarons. These surface electronic reconstructions, originating from the combined action of electron-lattice interaction and electronic correlation, are energetically more favorable than the 2DEG solution. They exhibit distinct spectroscopy signals and impact on the surface properties, as manifested by a local suppression of ferroelectric distortions.","Defect-free surfaces with excess charge are typically described as a homogeneous 2D electron gas. Here, in contrast, the authors find that the KTaO3(001) surface hosts a charge density wave coexisting with a pattern of electron polarons, highly localized states of excess electrons bound to a lattice distortion.",2022-07-25
1219,Postmitotic differentiation of human monocytes requires cohesin-structured chromatin,"Cohesin is a major structural component of mammalian genomes and is required to maintain loop structures. While acute depletion in short-term culture models suggests a limited importance of cohesin for steady-state transcriptional circuits, long-term studies are hampered by essential functions of cohesin during replication. Here, we study genome architecture in a postmitotic differentiation setting, the differentiation of human blood monocytes (MO). We profile and compare epigenetic, transcriptome and 3D conformation landscapes during MO differentiation (either into dendritic cells or macrophages) across the genome and detect numerous architectural changes, ranging from higher level compartments down to chromatin loops. Changes in loop structures correlate with cohesin-binding, as well as epigenetic and transcriptional changes during differentiation. Functional studies show that the siRNA-mediated depletion of cohesin (and to a lesser extent also CTCF) markedly disturbs loop structures and dysregulates genes and enhancers that are primarily regulated during normal MO differentiation. In addition, gene activation programs in cohesin-depleted MO-derived macrophages are disturbed. Our findings implicate an essential function of cohesin in controlling long-term, differentiation- and activation-associated gene expression programs.",How chromatin structure and gene accessibility changes during monocyte differentiation is not clearly defined. Here the authors characterize the chromatin changes during macrophage or dendritic cell maturation from monocytes and the dependence of this upon cohesin and CTCF.,2022-07-25
1220,Cell landscape of larval and adult Xenopus laevis at single-cell resolution,"The rapid development of high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing technology offers a good opportunity to dissect cell heterogeneity of animals. A large number of organism-wide single-cell atlases have been constructed for vertebrates such as Homo sapiens, Macaca fascicularis, Mus musculus and Danio rerio. However, an intermediate taxon that links mammals to vertebrates of more ancient origin is still lacking. Here, we construct the first Xenopus cell landscape to date, including larval and adult organs. Common cell lineage-specific transcription factors have been identified in vertebrates, including fish, amphibians and mammals. The comparison of larval and adult erythrocytes identifies stage-specific hemoglobin subtypes, as well as a common type of cluster containing both larval and adult hemoglobin, mainly at NF59. In addition, cell lineages originating from all three layers exhibits both antigen processing and presentation during metamorphosis, indicating a common regulatory mechanism during metamorphosis. Overall, our study provides a large-scale resource for research on Xenopus metamorphosis and adult organs.","Single-cell RNA sequencing technology offers a unique opportunity to dissect cell heterogeneity of animals.

1221,An analysis of 45 large-scale wastewater sites in England to estimate SARS-CoV-2 community prevalence,"Accurate surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic can be weakened by under-reporting of cases, particularly due to asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections, resulting in bias. Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can be used to infer infection prevalence, but uncertainty in sensitivity and considerable variability has meant that accurate measurement remains elusive. Here, we use data from 45 sewage sites in England, covering 31% of the population, and estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence to within 1.1% of estimates from representative prevalence surveys (with 95% confidence). Using machine learning and phenomenological models, we show that differences between sampled sites, particularly the wastewater flow rate, influence prevalence estimation and require careful interpretation. We find that SARS-CoV-2 signals in wastewater appear 4–5 days earlier in comparison to clinical testing data but are coincident with prevalence surveys suggesting that wastewater surveillance can be a leading indicator for symptomatic viral infections. Surveillance for viruses in wastewater complements and strengthens clinical surveillance, with significant implications for public health.","Wastewater surveillance could provide a means of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 prevalence that does not rely on testing individuals. Here, the authors report results from England’s national wastewater surveillance program, use it to estimate prevalence, and compare estimates with those from population-based prevalence surveys.",2022-07-25
1222,Frequency spectra and the color of cellular noise,"The invention of the Fourier integral in the 19th century laid the foundation for modern spectral analysis methods. This integral decomposes a temporal signal into its frequency components, providing deep insights into its generating process. While this idea has precipitated several scientific and technological advances, its impact has been fairly limited in cell biology, largely due to the difficulties in connecting the underlying noisy intracellular networks to the frequency content of observed single-cell trajectories. Here we develop a spectral theory and computational methodologies tailored specifically to the computation and analysis of frequency spectra of noisy intracellular networks. Specifically, we develop a method to compute the frequency spectrum for general nonlinear networks, and for linear networks we present a decomposition that expresses the frequency spectrum in terms of its sources. Several examples are presented to illustrate how our results provide frequency-based methods for the design and analysis of noisy intracellular networks.",The invention of the Fourier integral in the 19th century laid the foundation for modern spectral analysis methods.

1223,Dielectric catastrophe at the Wigner-Mott transition in a moiré superlattice,"The bandwidth-tuned Wigner-Mott transition is an interaction-driven phase transition from a generalized Wigner crystal to a Fermi liquid. Because the transition is generally accompanied by both magnetic and charge-order instabilities, it remains unclear if a continuous Wigner-Mott transition exists. Here, we demonstrate bandwidth-tuned metal-insulator transitions at fixed fractional fillings of a MoSe2/WS2 moiré superlattice. The bandwidth is controlled by an out-of-plane electric field. The dielectric response is probed optically with the 2s exciton in a remote WSe2 sensor layer. The exciton spectral weight is negligible for the metallic state with a large negative dielectric constant. It continuously vanishes when the transition is approached from the insulating side, corresponding to a diverging dielectric constant or a ‘dielectric catastrophe’ driven by the critical charge dynamics near the transition. Our results support the scenario of continuous Wigner-Mott transitions in two-dimensional triangular lattices and stimulate future explorations of exotic quantum phases in their vicinities.","The Wigner-Mott insulator is driven by extended Coulomb repulsion, rather than the on-site Coulomb repulsion of the Mott insulator. Here, the authors observe a continuous bandwidth-tuned transition between a metal and a Wigner-Mott insulator in a MoSe2/WS2 moiré superlattice at fractional lattice filling.",2022-07-25
1224,Supercurrent diode effect and magnetochiral anisotropy in few-layer NbSe2,"Nonreciprocal transport refers to charge transfer processes that are sensitive to the bias polarity. Until recently, nonreciprocal transport was studied only in dissipative systems, where the nonreciprocal quantity is the resistance. Recent experiments have, however, demonstrated nonreciprocal supercurrent leading to the observation of a supercurrent diode effect in Rashba superconductors. Here we report on a supercurrent diode effect in NbSe2 constrictions obtained by patterning NbSe2 flakes with both even and odd layer number. The observed rectification is a consequence of the valley-Zeeman spin-orbit interaction. We demonstrate a rectification efficiency as large as 60%, considerably larger than the efficiency of devices based on Rashba superconductors. In agreement with recent theory for superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, we show that the effect is driven by the out-of-plane component of the magnetic field. Remarkably, we find that the effect becomes field-asymmetric in the presence of an additional in-plane field component transverse to the current direction. Supercurrent diodes offer a further degree of freedom in designing superconducting quantum electronics with the high degree of integrability offered by van der Waals materials.","The supercurrent diode effect was recently observed in a Nb/V/Ta superlattice thin film with Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. Here, the authors observe this effect in few-layer NbSe2 crystals driven by valley-Zeeman-type spin-orbit coupling and find that the effect is proportional to out-of-plane magnetic field.",2022-07-23
1225,A phylogenetically-restricted essential cell cycle progression factor in the human pathogen Candida albicans,"Chromosomal instability caused by cell division errors is associated with antifungal drug resistance in fungal pathogens. Here, we identify potential mechanisms underlying such instability by conducting an overexpression screen monitoring chromosomal stability in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Analysis of ~1000 genes uncovers six chromosomal stability (CSA) genes, five of which are related to cell division genes of other organisms. The sixth gene, CSA6, appears to be present only in species belonging to the CUG-Ser clade, which includes C. albicans and other human fungal pathogens. The protein encoded by CSA6 localizes to the spindle pole bodies, is required for exit from mitosis, and induces a checkpoint-dependent metaphase arrest upon overexpression. Thus, Csa6 is an essential cell cycle progression factor that is restricted to the CUG-Ser fungal clade, and could therefore be explored as a potential antifungal target.","Chromosomal instability caused by cell division errors is associated with antifungal drug resistance in fungal pathogens. Here, Jaitly et al. identify several genes involved in chromosomal stability in Candida albicans, including a phylogenetically restricted gene encoding an essential cell-cycle progression factor.",2022-07-23
1226,Extensive co-binding and rapid redistribution of NANOG and GATA6 during emergence of divergent lineages,"Fate-determining transcription factors (TFs) can promote lineage-restricted transcriptional programs from common progenitor states. The inner cell mass (ICM) of mouse blastocysts co-expresses the TFs NANOG and GATA6, which drive the bifurcation of the ICM into either the epiblast (Epi) or the primitive endoderm (PrE), respectively. Here, we induce GATA6 in embryonic stem cells–that also express NANOG–to characterize how a state of co-expression of opposing TFs resolves into divergent lineages. Surprisingly, we find that GATA6 and NANOG co-bind at the vast majority of Epi and PrE enhancers, a phenomenon we also observe in blastocysts. The co-bound state is followed by eviction and repression of Epi TFs, and quick remodeling of chromatin and enhancer-promoter contacts thus establishing the PrE lineage while repressing the Epi fate. We propose that co-binding of GATA6 and NANOG at shared enhancers maintains ICM plasticity and promotes the rapid establishment of Epi- and PrE-specific transcriptional programs.",The authors show that the transcription factors NANOG and GATA6 co-bind the same enhancers in common progenitors before divergent epiblast and primitive endoderm lineages emerge. This may help maintain plasticity at early stages and facilitate bifurcation into distinct lineages,2022-07-23
1227,Development of a nanoparticle-based immunotherapy targeting PD-L1 and PLK1 for lung cancer treatment,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-L1 and PD-1 have improved survival in a subset of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, only a minority of NSCLC patients respond to ICIs, highlighting the need for superior immunotherapy. Herein, we report on a nanoparticle-based immunotherapy termed ARAC (Antigen Release Agent and Checkpoint Inhibitor) designed to enhance the efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitor. ARAC is a nanoparticle co-delivering PLK1 inhibitor (volasertib) and PD-L1 antibody. PLK1 is a key mitotic kinase that is overexpressed in various cancers including NSCLC and drives cancer growth. Inhibition of PLK1 selectively kills cancer cells and upregulates PD-L1 expression in surviving cancer cells thereby providing opportunity for ARAC targeted delivery in a feedforward manner. ARAC reduces effective doses of volasertib and PD-L1 antibody by 5-fold in a metastatic lung tumor model (LLC-JSP) and the effect is mainly mediated by CD8+ T cells. ARAC also shows efficacy in another lung tumor model (KLN-205), which does not respond to CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitor combination. This study highlights a rational combination strategy to augment existing therapies by utilizing our nanoparticle platform that can load multiple cargo types at once.","Only a minority of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here the authors design a nanosystem for the co-delivery of a PLK1 inhibitor and PD-L1 antibody, showing anti-tumor immune responses in preclinical lung cancer models.",2022-07-23
1228,Stress-testing the resilience of the Austrian healthcare system using agent-based simulation,"Patients do not access physicians at random but rather via naturally emerging networks of patient flows between them. As mass quarantines, absences due to sickness, or other shocks thin out these networks, the system might be pushed to a tipping point where it loses its ability to deliver care. Here, we propose a data-driven framework to quantify regional resilience to such shocks via an agent-based model. For each region and medical specialty we construct patient-sharing networks and stress-test these by removing physicians. This allows us to measure regional resilience indicators describing how many physicians can be removed before patients will not be treated anymore. Our model could therefore enable health authorities to rapidly identify bottlenecks in access to care. Here, we show that regions and medical specialties differ substantially in their resilience and that these systemic differences can be related to indicators for individual physicians by quantifying their risk and benefit to the system.","As mass quarantines, absences due to sickness, or other shocks thin out patient-physician networks, the system might be pushed to a tipping point where it loses its ability to deliver care. Here, the authors propose a data-driven framework to quantify regional resilience to such shocks via an agent-based model.",2022-07-23
1229,Mechanochemistry-driven engineering of 0D/3D heterostructure for designing highly luminescent Cs–Pb–Br perovskites,"Embedding metal-halide perovskite particles within an insulating host matrix has proven to be an effective strategy for revealing the outstanding luminescence properties of perovskites as an emerging class of light emitters. Particularly, unexpected bright green emission observed in a nominally pure zero-dimensional cesium–lead–bromide perovskite (Cs4PbBr6) has triggered intensive research in better understanding the serendipitous incorporation of emissive guest species within the Cs4PbBr6 host. However, a limited controllability over such heterostructural configurations in conventional solution-based synthesis methods has limited the degree of freedom in designing synthesis routes for accessing different structural and compositional configurations of these host–guest species. In this study, we provide means of enhancing the luminescence properties in the nominal Cs4PbBr6 powder through a guided heterostructural configuration engineering enabled by solid-state mechanochemical synthesis. Realized by an in-depth study on time-dependent evaluation of optical and structural properties during the synthesis of Cs4PbBr6, our target-designed synthesis protocol to promote the endotaxial formation of Cs4PbBr6/CsPbBr3 heterostructures provides key insights for understanding and designing kinetics-guided syntheses of highly luminescent perovskite emitters for light-emitting applications.","While emission and stability of metal–halide perovskites can be enhanced through heterostructural encapsulation, a controlled synthesis route to such structures is not trivial to realize. Here, the authors design a mechanochemistry-driven protocol for synthesizing highly luminescent CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 heterostructures.",2022-07-23
1230,Natural variation of DROT1 confers drought adaptation in upland rice,"Upland rice is a distinct ecotype that grows in aerobic environments and tolerates drought stress. However, the genetic basis of its drought resistance is unclear. Here, using an integrative approach combining a genome-wide association study with analyses of introgression lines and transcriptomic profiles, we identify a gene, DROUGHT1 (DROT1), encoding a COBRA-like protein that confers drought resistance in rice. DROT1 is specifically expressed in vascular bundles and is directly repressed by ERF3 and activated by ERF71, both drought-responsive transcription factors. DROT1 improves drought resistance by adjusting cell wall structure by increasing cellulose content and maintaining cellulose crystallinity. A C-to-T single-nucleotide variation in the promoter increases DROT1 expression and drought resistance in upland rice. The potential elite haplotype of DROT1 in upland rice could originate in wild rice (O. rufipogon) and may be beneficial for breeding upland rice varieties.","Genetic basis of the drought tolerance of upland rice is unclear. Here, the authors report the cloning of a COBRA-like protein encoding gene DROT1 and reveal that it is repressed by ERF3 and activated by ERF71 to help control the balance between growth and drought tolerance in upland rice.",2022-07-23
1231,Landscape of somatic alterations in large-scale solid tumors from an Asian population,"Extending the benefits of tumor molecular profiling for all cancer patients requires a comprehensive analysis of tumor genomes across distinct patient populations worldwide. In this study, we perform deep next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) from tumor tissues and matched blood specimens from over 10,000 patients in China by using a 450-gene comprehensive assay, developed and implemented under international clinical regulations. We perform a comprehensive comparison of somatically altered genes, the distribution of tumor mutational burden (TMB), gene fusion patterns, and the spectrum of various somatic alterations between Chinese and American patient populations. Here, we show 64% of cancers from Chinese patients in this study have clinically actionable genomic alterations, which may affect clinical decisions related to targeted therapy or immunotherapy. These findings describe the similarities and differences between tumors from Chinese and American patients, providing valuable information for personalized medicine.","Understanding the mutation landscape of cancer may enable the development of more targeted therapies. Here, the authors sequence a panel of genes in a large Asian cohort and compare to American cohorts and find 64% of the Asian patients have actionable mutations.",2022-07-23
1232,Multiple anthropogenic pressures eliminate the effects of soil microbial diversity on ecosystem functions in experimental microcosms,"Biodiversity is crucial for the provision of ecosystem functions. However, ecosystems are now exposed to a rapidly growing number of anthropogenic pressures, and it remains unknown whether biodiversity can still promote ecosystem functions under multifaceted pressures. Here we investigated the effects of soil microbial diversity on soil functions and properties when faced with an increasing number of simultaneous global change factors in experimental microcosms. Higher soil microbial diversity had a positive effect on soil functions and properties when no or few (i.e., 1–4) global change factors were applied, but this positive effect was eliminated by the co-occurrence of numerous global change factors. This was attributable to the reduction of soil fungal abundance and the relative abundance of an ecological cluster of coexisting soil bacterial and fungal taxa. Our study indicates that reducing the number of anthropogenic pressures should be a goal in ecosystem management, in addition to biodiversity conservation.","It is unclear whether the positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning are maintained under multifaceted anthropogenic disturbance. In this experiment, the authors show that multiple simultaneous stressors can negate the positive effect of microbial diversity on soil functions.",2022-07-23
1233,Discovering the drivers of clonal hematopoiesis,"Mutations in genes that confer a selective advantage to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) drive clonal hematopoiesis (CH). While some CH drivers have been identified, the compendium of all genes able to drive CH upon mutations in HSCs remains incomplete. Exploiting signals of positive selection in blood somatic mutations may be an effective way to identify CH driver genes, analogously to cancer. Using the tumor sample in blood/tumor pairs as reference, we identify blood somatic mutations across more than 12,000 donors from two large cancer genomics cohorts. The application of IntOGen, a driver discovery pipeline, to both cohorts, and more than 24,000 targeted sequenced samples yields a list of close to 70 genes with signals of positive selection in CH, available at http://www.intogen.org/ch. This approach recovers known CH genes, and discovers other candidates.","Identifying the genetic drivers of clonal haematopoiesis (CH) has been challenging due to their low frequencies and a lack of adequate tools. Here, the authors use a reverse calling to detect blood somatic mutations and the IntOGen pipeline to identify CH drivers in large cancer genomics data sets based on signals of positive selection.",2022-07-23
1234,A proteolytically activated antimicrobial toxin encoded on a mobile plasmid of Bacteroidales induces a protective response,"Phocaeicola vulgatus is one of the most abundant and ubiquitous bacterial species of the human gut microbiota, yet a comprehensive analysis of antibacterial toxin production by members of this species has not been reported. Here, we identify and characterize a previously undescribed antibacterial protein. This toxin, designated BcpT, is encoded on a small mobile plasmid that is largely confined to strains of the closely related species Phocaeicola vulgatus and Phocaeicola dorei. BcpT is unusual in that it requires cleavage at two distinct sites for activation, and we identify bacterial proteases that perform this activation. We further identify BcpT’s receptor as the Lipid A-core glycan, allowing BcpT to target species of other Bacteroidales families. Exposure of cells to BcpT induces a response involving an unusual sigma/anti-sigma factor pair that is likely triggered by cell envelope stress, resulting in the expression of genes that partially protect cells from multiple antimicrobial toxins.","The bacterium Phocaeicola vulgatus is commonly found in the human gut. Here, the authors show that the microorganism produces an antibacterial toxin that targets the LPS core glycan of closely related species and induces a response that partially protects cells from multiple antimicrobial toxins.",2022-07-23
1235,Rep15 interacts with several Rab GTPases and has a distinct fold for a Rab effector,"In their GTP-bound (active) form, Rab proteins interact with effector proteins that control downstream signaling. One such Rab15 effector is Rep15, which is known to have a role in receptor recycling from the endocytic recycling compartment but otherwise remains poorly characterized. Here, we report the characterization of the Rep15:Rab15 interaction and identification of Rab3 paralogs and Rab34 as Rep15 interacting partners from a yeast two-hybrid assay. Biochemical validation of the interactions is presented and crystal structures of the Rep15:Rab3B and Rep15:Rab3C complexes provide additional mechanistic insight. We find that Rep15 adopts a globular structure that is distinct from other reported Rab15, Rab3 and Rab34 effectors. Structure-based mutagenesis experiments explain the Rep15:Rab interaction specificity. Rep15 depletion in U138MG glioblastoma cells impairs cell proliferation, cell migration and receptor recycling, underscoring the need for further clarification of the role of Rep15 in cancer.","Rep15 is an effector that interacts with the GTPase Rab15. Here, the authors show that Rep15 also interacts with Rab3 paralogs and Rab34, present crystal structures of Rep15:Rab complexes and find that Rep15 depletion in glioblastoma cells decreases proliferation and mobility.",2022-07-23
1236,Imaging topological and correlated insulating states in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene,"Flat bands in Van der Waals heterostructure provide an ideal platform for unveiling emergent quantum electronic phases. One celebrated example is twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene, in which the effects of electronic correlation have been observed. Here, we report the observation via scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy of correlated insulating states in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene, leading to the formation of an electron crystal phase. At integer fillings, the strong Coulomb interaction redistributes flat-band electrons within one moiré unit cell, producing an insulating state with vanishing density of states at the Fermi level. Moreover, our approach enables the direct visualization of an ordered lattice of topological torus-shaped states, generated by the interaction between the electron crystal and the non-trivial band topology of twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene. Our results illustrate an efficient strategy for entwining topological physics with strong electron correlation in twisted van der Waals structures.","Twisted van der Waals structures represent a versatile platform to investigate topological and correlated electronic states. Here, the authors report the visualization of an electron crystal phase in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene via scanning tunnelling microscopy, studying the coupling between strong electron correlation and nontrivial band topology.",2022-07-22
1237,Personalized bacteriophage therapy to treat pandrug-resistant spinal Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection,"Bone and joint infections (BJI) are one of the most difficult-to-treat bacterial infection, especially in the era of antimicrobial resistance. Lytic bacteriophages (phages for short) are natural viruses that can selectively target and kill bacteria. They are considered to have a high therapeutic potential for the treatment of severe bacterial infections and especially BJI, as they also target biofilms. Here we report on the management of a patient with a pandrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa spinal abscess who was treated with surgery and a personalized combination of phage therapy that was added to antibiotics. As the infecting P. aeruginosa strain was resistant to the phages developed by private companies that were contacted, we set up a unique European academic collaboration to find, produce and administer a personalized phage cocktail to the patient in due time. After two surgeries, despite bacterial persistence with expression of small colony variants, the patient healed with local and intravenous injections of purified phages as adjuvant therapy.","Here, the authors describe a patient with a pandrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa spinal abscess successfully treated with a personalized combination of phage therapy and antibiotics.",2022-07-22
1238,Highly selective single and multiple deuteration of unactivated C(sp3)-H bonds,"Selective deuteration of unactivated C(sp3)-H bonds is a highly attractive but challenging subject of research in pharmaceutical chemistry, material science and synthetic chemistry. Reported herein is a practical, highly selective and economical efficient hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange of unactivated C(sp3)-H bonds by synergistic photocatalysis and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis. With the easily prepared PMP-substituted amides as nitrogen-centered radical precursors, a wide range of structurally diverse amides can undergo predictable radical H/D exchange smoothly with inexpensive D2O as the sole deuterium source, giving rise to the distal tertiary, secondary and primary C(sp3)-H bonds selectively deuterated products in yields of up to 99% and excellent D-incorporations. In addition to precise monodeuteration, this strategy can also achieve multideuteration of the substrates contain more than one remote C(sp3)-H bond, which opens a method to address multi-functionalization of distal unactivated C(sp3)–H bonds.","Deuteration of unactivated C(sp3)̵̵̵̵̵̵̵̵–H bonds is a simple route to deuterated compounds, of use in pharmaceutical chemistry, material science, and synthetic chemistry.

1239,Emergency triage of brain computed tomography via anomaly detection with a deep generative model,"Triage is essential for the early diagnosis and reporting of neurologic emergencies. Herein, we report the development of an anomaly detection algorithm (ADA) with a deep generative model trained on brain computed tomography (CT) images of healthy individuals that reprioritizes radiology worklists and provides lesion attention maps for brain CT images with critical findings. In the internal and external validation datasets, the ADA achieved area under the curve values (95% confidence interval) of 0.85 (0.81–0.89) and 0.87 (0.85–0.89), respectively, for detecting emergency cases. In a clinical simulation test of an emergency cohort, the median wait time was significantly shorter post-ADA triage than pre-ADA triage by 294 s (422.5 s [interquartile range, IQR 299] to 70.5 s [IQR 168]), and the median radiology report turnaround time was significantly faster post-ADA triage than pre-ADA triage by 297.5 s (445.0 s [IQR 298] to 88.5 s [IQR 179]) (all p < 0.001).","Triage is essential for the early diagnosis and reporting of emergency patients in the emergency department.

1240,Myasthenia gravis-specific aberrant neuromuscular gene expression by medullary thymic epithelial cells in thymoma,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neurological disease caused by autoantibodies against neuromuscular-associated proteins. While MG frequently develops in thymoma patients, the etiologic factors for MG are not well understood. Here, by constructing a comprehensive atlas of thymoma using bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identify ectopic expression of neuromuscular molecules in MG-type thymoma. These molecules are found within a distinct subpopulation of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which we name neuromuscular mTECs (nmTECs). MG-thymoma also exhibits microenvironments dedicated to autoantibody production, including ectopic germinal center formation, T follicular helper cell accumulation, and type 2 conventional dendritic cell migration. Cell–cell interaction analysis also predicts the interaction between nmTECs and T/B cells via CXCL12-CXCR4. The enrichment of nmTECs presenting neuromuscular molecules within MG-thymoma is further confirmed immunohistochemically and by cellular composition estimation from the MG-thymoma transcriptome. Altogether, this study suggests that nmTECs have a significant function in MG pathogenesis via ectopic expression of neuromuscular molecules.",Myasthenia Gravis and thymoma are frequently associated with patients suffering from both diseases. Here the authors perform single cell sequencing of thymoma and find that there are autoimmune antigens such as neuromuscular proteins expressed aberrantly in neuromuscular mTECs in patients with both diseases.,2022-07-22
1241,A critical role of the mechanosensor PIEZO1 in glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells,"Glucose-induced insulin secretion depends on β-cell electrical activity. Inhibition of ATP-regulated potassium (KATP) channels is a key event in this process. However, KATP channel closure alone is not sufficient to induce β-cell electrical activity; activation of a depolarizing membrane current is also required. Here we examine the role of the mechanosensor ion channel PIEZO1 in this process. Yoda1, a specific PIEZO1 agonist, activates a small membrane current and thereby triggers β-cell electrical activity with resultant stimulation of Ca2+-influx and insulin secretion. Conversely, the PIEZO1 antagonist GsMTx4 reduces glucose-induced Ca2+-signaling, electrical activity and insulin secretion. Yet, PIEZO1 expression is elevated in islets from human donors with type-2 diabetes (T2D) and a rodent T2D model (db/db mouse), in which insulin secretion is reduced. This paradox is resolved by our finding that PIEZO1 translocates from the plasmalemma into the nucleus (where it cannot influence the membrane potential of the β-cell) under experimental conditions emulating T2D (high glucose culture). β-cell-specific Piezo1-knockout mice show impaired glucose tolerance in vivo and reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion, β-cell electrical activity and Ca2+ elevation in vitro. These results implicate mechanotransduction and activation of PIEZO1, via intracellular accumulation of glucose metabolites, as an important physiological regulator of insulin secretion.","Insulin secretion depends on action potential firing in pancreatic islet beta-cells, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, the authors show that activation of the mechanosensor ion channel PIEZO1 plays a central role in beta-cell electrical activity and insulin release.",2022-07-22
1242,Modulating the strong metal-support interaction of single-atom catalysts via vicinal structure decoration,"Metal-support interaction predominately determines the electronic structure of metal atoms in single-atom catalysts (SACs), largely affecting their catalytic performance. However, directly tuning the metal-support interaction in oxide supported SACs remains challenging. Here, we report a new strategy to subtly regulate the strong covalent metal-support interaction (CMSI) of Pt/CoFe2O4 SACs by a simple water soaking treatment. Detailed studies reveal that the CMSI is weakened by the bonding of H+, generated from water dissociation, onto the interface of Pt-O-Fe, resulting in reduced charge transfer from metal to support and leading to an increase of C-H bond activation in CH4 combustion by more than 50 folds. This strategy is general and can be extended to other CMSI-existed metal-supported catalysts, providing a powerful tool to modulating the catalytic performance of SACs.","A simple water soaking treatment significantly weakened the strong covalent metal-support interaction between the atomically dispersed Pt and CoFe2O4, which leads to an enhanced activity towards methane combustions by 55 times. This work highlights the critical role of altering the coordination structure of single-atom active sites and provides a new strategy to modulate metal-support interaction regulation.",2022-07-22
1243,Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV promotes imiquimod-induced psoriatic inflammation via macrophages and keratinocytes in mice,"CaMK4 has an important function in autoimmune diseases, and the contribution of CaMK4 in psoriasis remains obscure. Here, we show that CaMK4 expression is significantly increased in psoriatic lesional skin from psoriasis patients compared to healthy human skin as well as inflamed skin from an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model of psoriasis compared to healthy mouse skin. Camk4-deficient (Camk4−/−) mice treated with IMQ exhibit reduced severity of psoriasis compared to wild-type (WT) mice. There are more macrophages and fewer IL-17A+γδ TCR+ cells in the skin of IMQ-treated Camk4−/− mice compared to IMQ-treated WT mice. CaMK4 inhibits IL-10 production by macrophages, thus allowing excessive psoriatic inflammation. Deletion of Camk4 in macrophages alleviates IMQ-induced psoriatic inflammation in mice. In keratinocytes, CaMK4 inhibits apoptosis as well as promotes cell proliferation and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as S100A8 and CAMP. Taken together, these data indicate that CaMK4 regulates IMQ-induced psoriasis by sustaining inflammation and provides a potential target for psoriasis treatment.",Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4) has been shown to be involved in autoimmunity but it is not clear how it functions in psoriasis. Here the authors show that CaMK4 is increased in psoriasis and promotes inflammatory responses in mouse models of psoriasis mediated through macrophages and keratinocytes.,2022-07-22
1244,Construction of the axolotl cell landscape using combinatorial hybridization sequencing at single-cell resolution,"The Mexican axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is a well-established tetrapod model for regeneration and developmental studies. Remarkably, neotenic axolotls may undergo metamorphosis, a process that triggers many dramatic changes in diverse organs, accompanied by gradually decline of their regeneration capacity and lifespan. However, the molecular regulation and cellular changes in neotenic and metamorphosed axolotls are still poorly investigated. Here, we develop a single-cell sequencing method based on combinatorial hybridization to generate a tissue-based transcriptomic landscape of the neotenic and metamorphosed axolotls. We perform gene expression profiling of over 1 million single cells across 19 tissues to construct the first adult axolotl cell landscape. Comparison of single-cell transcriptomes between the tissues of neotenic and metamorphosed axolotls reveal the heterogeneity of non-immune parenchymal cells in different tissues and established their regulatory network. Furthermore, we describe dynamic gene expression patterns during limb development in neotenic axolotls. This system-level single-cell analysis of molecular characteristics in neotenic and metamorphosed axolotls, serves as a resource to explore the molecular identity of the axolotl and facilitates better understanding of metamorphosis.","The Mexican axolotl is a well-established tetrapod model for regeneration and development.

1245,Structure of DNMT3B homo-oligomer reveals vulnerability to impairment by ICF mutations,"DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B plays an essential role in establishment of DNA methylation during embryogenesis. Mutations of DNMT3B are associated with human diseases, notably the immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome. How ICF mutations affect DNMT3B activity is not fully understood. Here we report the homo-oligomeric structure of DNMT3B methyltransferase domain, providing insight into DNMT3B-mediated DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells where the functional regulator DNMT3L is dispensable. The interplay between one of the oligomer interfaces (FF interface) and the catalytic loop renders DNMT3B homo-oligomer a conformation and activity distinct from the DNMT3B-DNMT3L heterotetramer, and a greater vulnerability to certain ICF mutations. Biochemical and cellular analyses further reveal that the ICF mutations of FF interface impair the DNA binding and heterochromatin targeting of DNMT3B, leading to reduced DNA methylation in cells. Together, this study provides a mechanistic understanding of DNMT3B-mediated DNA methylation and its dysregulation in disease.","In mammals, de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B is essential for establishing DNA methylation patterns during embryonic development. Here the authors provide a structure-function characterization of homo-oligomeric DNMT3B, revealing the molecular basis for its vulnerability to ICF mutations.",2022-07-22
1246,A multi-omic dissection of super-enhancer driven oncogenic gene expression programs in ovarian cancer,"The human genome contains regulatory elements, such as enhancers, that are often rewired by cancer cells for the activation of genes that promote tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy. This is especially true for cancers that have little or no known driver mutations within protein coding genes, such as ovarian cancer. Herein, we utilize an integrated set of genomic and epigenomic datasets to identify clinically relevant super-enhancers that are preferentially amplified in ovarian cancer patients. We systematically probe the top 86 super-enhancers, using CRISPR-interference and CRISPR-deletion assays coupled to RNA-sequencing, to nominate two salient super-enhancers that drive proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Utilizing Hi-C, we construct chromatin interaction maps that enable the annotation of direct target genes for these super-enhancers and confirm their activity specifically within the cancer cell compartment of human tumors using single-cell genomics data. Together, our multi-omic approach examines a number of fundamental questions about how regulatory information encoded into super-enhancers drives gene expression networks that underlie the biology of ovarian cancer.","Super-enhancers and their associated transcription factor networks have been shown to influence ovarian cancer biology. Here, based on an integrated set of genomic and epigenomic datasets, the authors identify clinically relevant super-enhancers amplified in ovarian cancer patients and functionally validate their activity.",2022-07-22
1247,Ultrastrong and multifunctional aerogels with hyperconnective network of composite polymeric nanofibers,"Three-dimensional (3D) microfibrillar network represents an important structural design for various natural tissues and synthetic aerogels. Despite extensive efforts, achieving high mechanical properties for synthetic 3D microfibrillar networks remains challenging. Here, we report ultrastrong polymeric aerogels involving self-assembled 3D networks of aramid nanofiber composites. The interactions between the nanoscale constituents lead to assembled networks with high nodal connectivity and strong crosslinking between fibrils. As revealed by theoretical simulations of 3D networks, these features at fibrillar joints may lead to an enhancement of macroscopic mechanical properties by orders of magnitude even with a constant level of solid content. Indeed, the polymeric aerogels achieved both high specific tensile modulus of ~625.3 MPa cm3 g−1 and fracture energy of ~4700 J m−2, which are advantageous for diverse structural applications. Furthermore, their simple processing techniques allow fabrication into various functional devices, such as wearable electronics, thermal stealth, and filtration membranes. The mechanistic insights and manufacturability provided by these robust microfibrillar aerogels may create further opportunities for materials design and technological innovation.","Three-dimensional (3D) microfibrillar network represents an important structural design for various natural tissues and synthetic aerogels but achieving high mechanical properties for synthetic 3D microfibrillar networks remains challenging.

1248,Neurocomputational mechanisms of confidence in self and others,"Computing confidence in one’s own and others’ decisions is critical for social success. While there has been substantial progress in our understanding of confidence estimates about oneself, little is known about how people form confidence estimates about others. Here, we address this question by asking participants undergoing fMRI to place bets on perceptual decisions made by themselves or one of three other players of varying ability. We show that participants compute confidence in another player’s decisions by combining distinct estimates of player ability and decision difficulty – allowing them to predict that a good player may get a difficult decision wrong and that a bad player may get an easy decision right. We find that this computation is associated with an interaction between brain systems implicated in decision-making (LIP) and theory of mind (TPJ and dmPFC). These results reveal an interplay between self- and other-related processes during a social confidence computation.",Estimating confidence in the decision making ability of others is important for cooperative behaviour.

1249,Nanoscale regulation of Ca2+ dependent phase transitions and real-time dynamics of SAP97/hDLG,"Synapse associated protein-97/Human Disk Large (SAP97/hDLG) is a conserved, alternatively spliced, modular, scaffolding protein critical in regulating the molecular organization of cell-cell junctions in vertebrates. We confirm that the molecular determinants of first order phase transition of SAP97/hDLG is controlled by morpho-functional changes in its nanoscale organization. Furthermore, the nanoscale molecular signatures of these signalling islands and phase transitions are altered in response to changes in cytosolic Ca2+. Additionally, exchange kinetics of alternatively spliced isoforms of the intrinsically disordered region in SAP97/hDLG C-terminus shows differential sensitivities to Ca2+ bound Calmodulin, affirming that the molecular signatures of local phase transitions of SAP97/hDLG depends on their nanoscale heterogeneity and compositionality of isoforms.","SAP97/hDLG is a ubiquitous, alternatively spliced, and conserved modular scaffolding protein involved in the organization cell junctions and excitatory synapses. Here, authors confirm that SAP97/hDLG condenses in to nanosized molecular domains in both heterologous cells and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Authors demonstrate that in vivo and in vitro condensation, molecular signatures of nanoscale condensates and exchange kinetics of SAP97/hDLG is modulated by the local availability of alternatively spliced isoforms. Additionally, SAP97/hDLG isoforms exhibits a differential sensitivity to Ca2+ bound Calmodulin, resulting in altered properties of nanocondensates and their real-time regulation",2022-07-22
1250,A temperature-regulated circuit for feeding behavior,"Both rodents and primates have evolved to orchestrate food intake to maintain thermal homeostasis in coping with ambient temperature challenges. However, the mechanisms underlying temperature-coordinated feeding behavior are rarely reported. Here we find that a non-canonical feeding center, the anteroventral and periventricular portions of medial preoptic area (apMPOA) respond to altered dietary states in mice. Two neighboring but distinct neuronal populations in apMPOA mediate feeding behavior by receiving anatomical inputs from external and dorsal subnuclei of lateral parabrachial nucleus. While both populations are glutamatergic, the arcuate nucleus-projecting neurons in apMPOA can sense low temperature and promote food intake. The other type, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH)-projecting neurons in apMPOA are primarily sensitive to high temperature and suppress food intake. Caspase ablation or chemogenetic inhibition of the apMPOA→PVH pathway can eliminate the temperature dependence of feeding. Further projection-specific RNA sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization identify that the two neuronal populations are molecularly marked by galanin receptor and apelin receptor. These findings reveal unrecognized cell populations and circuits of apMPOA that orchestrates feeding behavior against thermal challenges.","Feeding behavior is modulated by ambient temperature, as lower temperatures increase the necessity for energy intake and vice versa. Here the authors identify neuronal pathways that control feeding in a temperature-dependent manner.",2022-07-22
1251,Bipolar charge collecting structure enables overall water splitting on ferroelectric photocatalysts,"Ferroelectrics are considered excellent photocatalytic candidates for solar fuel production because of the unidirectional charge separation and above-gap photovoltage. Nevertheless, the performance of ferroelectric photocatalysts is often moderate. A few studies showed that these types of photocatalysts could achieve overall water splitting. This paper proposes an approach to fabricating interfacial charge-collecting nanostructures on positive and negative domains of ferroelectric, enabling water splitting in ferroelectric photocatalysts. The present study observes efficient accumulations of photogenerated electrons and holes within their thermalization length (~50 nm) around Au nanoparticles located in the positive and negative domains of a BaTiO3 single crystal. Photocatalytic overall water splitting is observed on a ferroelectric BaTiO3 single crystal after assembling oxidation and reduction cocatalysts on the positively and negatively charged Au nanoparticles, respectively. The fabrication of bipolar charge-collecting structures on ferroelectrics to achieve overall water splitting offers a way to utilize the energetic photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.","While ferroelectric materials are promising candidates for solar water splitting, most examples show poor activities. Here, authors prepare charge-collecting nanostructures on the positive and negative domains of BaTiO3 and demonstrate photocatalytic overall water splitting.",2022-07-22
1252,TDP1-independent pathways in the process and repair of TOP1-induced DNA damage,"Anticancer drugs, such as camptothecin (CPT), trap topoisomerase I (TOP1) on DNA and form TOP1 cleavage complexes (TOP1cc). Alternative repair pathways have been suggested in the repair of TOP1cc. However, how these pathways work with TDP1, a key repair enzyme that specifically hydrolyze the covalent bond between TOP1 catalytic tyrosine and the 3’-end of DNA and contribute to the repair of TOP1cc is poorly understood. Here, using unbiased whole-genome CRISPR screens and generation of co-deficient cells with TDP1 and other genes, we demonstrate that MUS81 is an important factor that mediates the generation of excess double-strand breaks (DSBs) in TDP1 KO cells. APEX1/2 are synthetic lethal with TDP1. However, deficiency of APEX1/2 does not reduce DSB formation in TDP1 KO cells. Together, our data suggest that TOP1cc can be either resolved directly by TDP1 or be converted into DSBs and repaired further by the Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway.",Here the authors find that MUS81 mediates excess DNA double strand break (DSB) generation in TDP1 KO cells after camptothecin treatment. They show that TOP1 cleavage complexes can be either resolved directly by TDP1 or be converted into DSBs and repaired further by the Homologous Recombination pathway.,2022-07-22
1253,Targeting loop3 of sclerostin preserves its cardiovascular protective action and promotes bone formation,"Sclerostin negatively regulates bone formation by antagonizing Wnt signalling. An antibody targeting sclerostin for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with a boxed warning for cardiovascular risk. Here we demonstrate that sclerostin participates in protecting cardiovascular system and inhibiting bone formation via different loops. Loop3 deficiency by genetic truncation could maintain sclerostin’s protective effect on the cardiovascular system while attenuating its inhibitory effect on bone formation. We identify an aptamer, named aptscl56, which specifically targets sclerostin loop3 and use a modified aptscl56 version, called Apc001PE, as specific in vivo pharmacologic tool to validate the above effect of loop3. Apc001PE has no effect on aortic aneurysm and atherosclerotic development in ApoE−/− mice and hSOSTki.ApoE−/− mice with angiotensin II infusion. Apc001PE can promote bone formation in hSOSTki mice and ovariectomy-induced osteoporotic rats. In summary, sclerostin loop3 cannot participate in protecting the cardiovascular system, but participates in inhibiting bone formation.","Antibodies targeting sclerostin can ameliorate postmenopausal osteoporosis but present some cardiovascular risk. Here the authors show that the cardiovascular and skeletal effects of sclerostin are mediated by different loops, suggesting ways to preserve the positive effects on bone formation while avoiding the negative cardiovascular consequences.",2022-07-22
1254,Intratumor graph neural network recovers hidden prognostic value of multi-biomarker spatial heterogeneity,"Biomarkers are indispensable for precision medicine. However, focused single-biomarker development using human tissue has been complicated by sample spatial heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we tested a representation of primary tumor that synergistically integrated multiple in situ biomarkers of extracellular matrix from multiple sampling regions into an intratumor graph neural network. Surprisingly, the differential prognostic value of this computational model over its conventional non-graph counterpart approximated that of combined routine prognostic biomarkers (tumor size, nodal status, histologic grade, molecular subtype, etc.) for 995 breast cancer patients under a retrospective study. This large prognostic value, originated from implicit but interpretable regional interactions among the graphically integrated in situ biomarkers, would otherwise be lost if they were separately developed into single conventional (spatially homogenized) biomarkers. Our study demonstrates an alternative route to cancer prognosis by taping the regional interactions among existing biomarkers rather than developing novel biomarkers.","Cancer prognosis using multiregion sampling is costly and not completely reliable due to the required biomarker homogenisation step. Here, the authors develop an intratumor graph neural network for prognosis in multiregion cancer samples based on in situ biomarkers and gene expression that does not need homogenisation.",2022-07-22
1255,Development of a novel core genome MLST scheme for tracing multidrug resistant Staphylococcus capitis,"Staphylococcus capitis, which causes bloodstream infections in neonatal intensive care units, is a common cause of healthcare-associated infections. Thus, a standardized high-resolution typing method to document the transmission and dissemination of multidrug-resistant S. capitis isolates is required. We aimed to establish a core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) scheme to surveil S. capitis. The cgMLST scheme was defined based on primary and validation genome sets and tested with outbreaks of linezolid-resistant isolates and a validation set. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the population structure and compare it with the result of cgMLST analysis. The S. capitis population consists of 1 dominant, NRCS-A, and 4 less common clones. In this work, a multidrug-resistant clone (L clone) with linezolid resistance is identified. With the features of type III SCCmec and multiple copies of mutations of G2576T and C2104T in the 23S rRNA, the L clone has been spreading silently across China.","Staphylococcus capitis is a common causative agent of bloodstream infections in neonatal intensive care units, with multidrug resistant isolates complicating treatment.

1256,Differential analysis of RNA structure probing experiments at nucleotide resolution: uncovering regulatory functions of RNA structure,"RNAs perform their function by forming specific structures, which can change across cellular conditions. Structure probing experiments combined with next generation sequencing technology have enabled transcriptome-wide analysis of RNA secondary structure in various cellular conditions. Differential analysis of structure probing data in different conditions can reveal the RNA structurally variable regions (SVRs), which is important for understanding RNA functions. Here, we propose DiffScan, a computational framework for normalization and differential analysis of structure probing data in high resolution. DiffScan preprocesses structure probing datasets to remove systematic bias, and then scans the transcripts to identify SVRs and adaptively determines their lengths and locations. The proposed approach is compatible with most structure probing platforms (e.g., icSHAPE, DMS-seq). When evaluated with simulated and benchmark datasets, DiffScan identifies structurally variable regions at nucleotide resolution, with substantial improvement in accuracy compared with existing SVR detection methods. Moreover, the improvement is robust when tested in multiple structure probing platforms. Application of DiffScan in a dataset of multi-subcellular RNA structurome and a subsequent motif enrichment analysis suggest potential links of RNA structural variation and mRNA abundance, possibly mediated by RNA binding proteins such as the serine/arginine rich splicing factors. This work provides an effective tool for differential analysis of RNA secondary structure, reinforcing the power of structure probing experiments in deciphering the dynamic RNA structurome.","The authors present DiffScan, an advanced tool for normalization and differential analysis of RNA structure probing experiments, combining their power in deciphering the dynamic RNA structurome and facilitating the discovery of RNA regulatory functions.",2022-07-22
1257,Heparin induces α-synuclein to form new fibril polymorphs with attenuated neuropathology,"α-Synuclein (α-syn), as a primary pathogenic protein in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies, exhibits a high potential to form polymorphic fibrils. Chemical ligands have been found to involve in the assembly of α-syn fibrils in patients’ brains. However, how ligands influence the fibril polymorphism remains vague. Here, we report the near-atomic structures of α-syn fibrils in complex with heparin, a representative glycosaminoglycan (GAG), determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structures demonstrate that the presence of heparin completely alters the fibril assembly via rearranging the charge interactions of α-syn both at the intramolecular and the inter-protofilamental levels, which leads to the generation of four fibril polymorphs. Remarkably, in one of the fibril polymorphs, α-syn folds into a distinctive conformation that has not been observed previously. Moreover, the heparin-α-syn complex fibrils exhibit diminished neuropathology in primary neurons. Our work provides the structural mechanism for how heparin determines the assembly of α-syn fibrils, and emphasizes the important role of biological polymers in the conformational selection and neuropathology regulation of amyloid fibrils.",The Cryo-EM structures reported in this work reveal how heparin incorporates into α-syn fibril formation to determine fibril polymorphs. This highlights the role of biological polymers in the conformational selection and neuropathological regulation of amyloid fibrils.,2022-07-22
1258,Predicting memory from the network structure of naturalistic events,"When we remember events, we often do not only recall individual events, but also the connections between them. However, extant research has focused on how humans segment and remember discrete events from continuous input, with far less attention given to how the structure of connections between events impacts memory. Here we conduct a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which participants watch and recall a series of realistic audiovisual narratives. By transforming narratives into networks of events, we demonstrate that more central events—those with stronger semantic or causal connections to other events—are better remembered. During encoding, central events evoke larger hippocampal event boundary responses associated with memory formation. During recall, high centrality is associated with stronger activation in cortical areas involved in episodic recollection, and more similar neural representations across individuals. Together, these results suggest that when humans encode and retrieve complex real-world experiences, the reliability and accessibility of memory representations is shaped by their location within a network of events.","Naturalistic experiences often have complex structure, consisting of multiple inter-related events. Here, the authors show that the semantic and causal interconnectedness of events in narratives positively predicts memory performance and neural responses associated with memory encoding and recall.",2022-07-22
1259,A macroscopic link between interhemispheric tract myelination and cortico-cortical interactions during action reprogramming,"Myelination has been increasingly implicated in the function and dysfunction of the adult human brain. Although it is known that axon myelination shapes axon physiology in animal models, it is unclear whether a similar principle applies in the living human brain, and at the level of whole axon bundles in white matter tracts. Here, we hypothesised that in humans, cortico-cortical interactions between two brain areas may be shaped by the amount of myelin in the white matter tract connecting them. As a test bed for this hypothesis, we use a well-defined interhemispheric premotor-to-motor circuit. We combined TMS-derived physiological measures of cortico-cortical interactions during action reprogramming with multimodal myelin markers (MT, R1, R2* and FA), in a large cohort of healthy subjects. We found that physiological metrics of premotor-to-motor interaction are broadly associated with multiple myelin markers, suggesting interindividual differences in tract myelination may play a role in motor network physiology. Moreover, we also demonstrate that myelination metrics link indirectly to action switching by influencing local primary motor cortex dynamics. These findings suggest that myelination levels in white matter tracts may influence millisecond-level cortico-cortical interactions during tasks. They also unveil a link between the physiology of the motor network and the myelination of tracts connecting its components, and provide a putative mechanism mediating the relationship between brain myelination and human behaviour.","Myelination is a key regulator of brain function. Here the authors use MR-based myelin measures to examine if cortico-cortical interactions, as assessed by paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, are affected by variations in myelin in the human brain.",2022-07-22
1260,Modulating co-translational protein folding by rational design and ribosome engineering,"Co-translational folding is a fundamental process for the efficient biosynthesis of nascent polypeptides that emerge through the ribosome exit tunnel. To understand how this process is modulated by the shape and surface of the narrow tunnel, we have rationally engineered three exit tunnel protein loops (uL22, uL23 and uL24) of the 70S ribosome by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, and studied the co-translational folding of an immunoglobulin-like filamin domain (FLN5). Our thermodynamics measurements employing 19F/15N/methyl-TROSY NMR spectroscopy together with cryo-EM and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how the variations in the lengths of the loops present across species exert their distinct effects on the free energy of FLN5 folding. A concerted interplay of the uL23 and uL24 loops is sufficient to alter co-translational folding energetics, which we highlight by the opposite folding outcomes resulting from their extensions. These subtle modulations occur through a combination of the steric effects relating to the shape of the tunnel, the dynamic interactions between the ribosome surface and the unfolded nascent chain, and its altered exit pathway within the vestibule. These results illustrate the role of the exit tunnel structure in co-translational folding, and provide principles for how to remodel it to elicit a desired folding outcome.","The narrow exit tunnel of the ribosome is important for cotranslational protein folding. Here, authors show that their rationally designed and engineered exit tunnel protein loops modulate the free energy of nascent chain dynamics and folding.",2022-07-22
1261,Probing the mesoscopic size limit of quantum anomalous Hall insulators,"The inelastic scattering length (Ls) is a length scale of fundamental importance in condensed matters due to the relationship between inelastic scattering and quantum dephasing. In quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) materials, the mesoscopic length scale Ls plays an instrumental role in determining transport properties. Here we examine Ls in three regimes of the QAH system with distinct transport behaviors: the QAH, quantum critical, and insulating regimes. Although the resistance changes by five orders of magnitude when tuning between these distinct electronic phases, scaling analyses indicate a universal Ls among all regimes. Finally, mesoscopic scaled devices with sizes on the order of Ls were fabricated, enabling the direct detection of the value of Ls in QAH samples. Our results unveil the fundamental length scale that governs the transport behavior of QAH materials.","In quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) materials, the mesoscopic scattering length (Ls) plays an instrumental role in determining transport properties. Here, the authors examine Ls in three regimes (QAH, quantum critical, and insulating) with distinct transport behaviours, and find a universal Ls across all regimes.",2022-07-22
1262,Altered tRNA dynamics during translocation on slippery mRNA as determinant of spontaneous ribosome frameshifting,"When reading consecutive mRNA codons, ribosomes move by exactly one triplet at a time to synthesize a correct protein. Some mRNA tracks, called slippery sequences, are prone to ribosomal frameshifting, because the same tRNA can read both 0- and –1-frame codon. Using smFRET we show that during EF-G-catalyzed translocation on slippery sequences a fraction of ribosomes spontaneously switches from rapid, accurate translation to a slow, frameshifting-prone translocation mode where the movements of peptidyl- and deacylated tRNA become uncoupled. While deacylated tRNA translocates rapidly, pept-tRNA continues to fluctuate between chimeric and posttranslocation states, which slows down the re-locking of the small ribosomal subunit head domain. After rapid release of deacylated tRNA, pept-tRNA gains unconstrained access to the –1-frame triplet, resulting in slippage followed by recruitment of the –1-frame aa-tRNA into the A site. Our data show how altered choreography of tRNA and ribosome movements reduces the translation fidelity of ribosomes translocating in a slow mode.","Slippery sequences in mRNA can cause the ribosome to change its reading frame. Using smFRET, Poulis et al. show how reversible fluctuations of peptidyl-tRNA slow down translocation, alter ribosome dynamics, and favor spontaneous ribosome frameshifting.",2022-07-22
1263,Forecasting the evolution of fast-changing transportation networks using machine learning,"Transportation networks play a critical role in human mobility and the exchange of goods, but they are also the primary vehicles for the worldwide spread of infections, and account for a significant fraction of CO2 emissions. We investigate the edge removal dynamics of two mature but fast-changing transportation networks: the Brazilian domestic bus transportation network and the U.S. domestic air transportation network. We use machine learning approaches to predict edge removal on a monthly time scale and find that models trained on data for a given month predict edge removals for the same month with high accuracy. For the air transportation network, we also find that models trained for a given month are still accurate for other months even in the presence of external shocks. We take advantage of this approach to forecast the impact of a hypothetical dramatic reduction in the scale of the U.S. air transportation network as a result of policies to reduce CO2 emissions. Our forecasting approach could be helpful in building scenarios for planning future infrastructure.",Transportation networks undergo permanent changes influenced by a variety of human-induced and natural factors. The authors propose here a machine learning framework for prediction of connections removal that could be useful in building scenarios for transportation infrastructure needs.,2022-07-22
1264,Accurate somatic variant detection using weakly supervised deep learning,"Identification of somatic mutations in tumor samples is commonly based on statistical methods in combination with heuristic filters. Here we develop VarNet, an end-to-end deep learning approach for identification of somatic variants from aligned tumor and matched normal DNA reads. VarNet is trained using image representations of 4.6 million high-confidence somatic variants annotated in 356 tumor whole genomes. We benchmark VarNet across a range of publicly available datasets, demonstrating performance often exceeding current state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our results demonstrate how a scalable deep learning approach could augment and potentially supplant human engineered features and heuristic filters in somatic variant calling.","Deep learning could be applied to the challenge of somatic variant calling in cancer by making use of large-scale genomic data.

1265,Biallelic and gene-wide genomic substitution for endogenous intron and retroelement mutagenesis in human cells,"Functional annotation of the vast noncoding landscape of the diploid human genome still remains a major challenge of genomic research. An efficient, scarless, biallelic, and gene-wide mutagenesis approach is needed for direct investigation of the functional significance of endogenous long introns in gene regulation. Here we establish a genome substitution platform, the Universal Knock-in System or UKiS, that meets these requirements. For proof of concept, we first used UKiS on the longest intron of TP53 in the pseudo-diploid cell line HCT116. Complete deletion of the intron, its substitution with mouse and zebrafish syntenic introns, and specific removal of retrotransposon-derived elements (retroelements) were all efficiently and accurately achieved in both alleles, revealing a suppressive role of intronic Alu elements in TP53 expression. We also used UKiS for TP53 intron deletion in human induced pluripotent stem cells without losing their stemness. Furthermore, UKiS enabled biallelic removal of all introns from three human gene loci of ~100 kb and longer to demonstrate that intron requirements for transcriptional activities vary among genes. UKiS is a standard platform with which to pursue the design of noncoding regions for genome writing in human cells.","Functional annotation of the vast noncoding landscape of the diploid human genome still remains a major challenge of genomic research. Here the authors present a scarless, biallelic, and 100 kb-scale mutagenesis in human cells that uncovers functional significances of endogenous introns and retrotransposons in the chromatin context.",2022-07-21
1266,Etv2 regulates enhancer chromatin status to initiate Shh expression in the limb bud,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is essential for limb development, and the mechanisms that govern the propagation and maintenance of its expression has been well studied; however, the mechanisms that govern the initiation of Shh expression are incomplete. Here we report that ETV2 initiates Shh expression by changing the chromatin status of the developmental limb enhancer, ZRS. Etv2 expression precedes Shh in limb buds, and Etv2 inactivation prevents the opening of limb chromatin, including the ZRS, resulting in an absence of Shh expression. Etv2 overexpression in limb buds causes nucleosomal displacement at the ZRS, ectopic Shh expression, and polydactyly. Areas of nucleosome displacement coincide with ETS binding site clusters. ETV2 also functions as a transcriptional activator of ZRS and is antagonized by ETV4/5 repressors. Known human polydactyl mutations introduce novel ETV2 binding sites in the ZRS, suggesting that ETV2 dosage regulates ZRS activation. These studies identify ETV2 as a pioneer transcription factor (TF) regulating the onset of Shh expression, having both a chromatin regulatory role and a transcriptional activation role.","The embryonic limb bud is known to be patterned by a Shh morphogen gradient, though how Shh expression is activated remains less clear. Here the authors show that Etv2 acts as a pioneer transcription factor to mediate accessibility of the ZRS enhancer and initiate Shh expression.",2022-07-21
1267,Lateral habenula glutamatergic neurons projecting to the dorsal raphe nucleus promote aggressive arousal in mice,"The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is known to control aggressive behavior in mice. Here, we found that glutamatergic projections from the lateral habenula (LHb) to the DRN were activated in male mice that experienced pre-exposure to a rival male mouse (“social instigation”) resulting in heightened intermale aggression. Both chemogenetic and optogenetic suppression of the LHb-DRN projection blocked heightened aggression after social instigation in male mice. In contrast, inhibition of this pathway did not affect basal levels of aggressive behavior, suggesting that the activity of the LHb-DRN projection is not necessary for the expression of species-typical aggressive behavior, but required for the increase of aggressive behavior resulting from social instigation. Anatomical analysis showed that LHb neurons synapse on non-serotonergic DRN neurons that project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and optogenetic activation of the DRN-VTA projection increased aggressive behaviors. Our results demonstrate that the LHb glutamatergic inputs to the DRN promote aggressive arousal induced by social instigation, which contributes to aggressive behavior by activating VTA-projecting non-serotonergic DRN neurons as one of its potential targets.",The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is known to modulate aggressive behaviour in rodents. Here the authors show that glutamatergic projections from the lateral habenula to DRN modulate aggression between male mice.,2022-07-21
1268,Engineered biomimetic nanoparticles achieve targeted delivery and efficient metabolism-based synergistic therapy against glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain cancer with a poor prognosis and few treatment options. Here, building on the observation of elevated lactate (LA) in resected GBM, we develop biomimetic therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) that deliver agents for LA metabolism-based synergistic therapy. Because our self-assembling NPs are encapsulated in membranes derived from glioma cells, they readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier and target GBM through homotypic recognition. After reaching the tumors, lactate oxidase in the NPs converts LA into pyruvic acid (PA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The PA inhibits cancer cell growth by blocking histones expression and inducing cell-cycle arrest. In parallel, the H2O2 reacts with the delivered bis[2,4,5-trichloro-6-(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate to release energy, which is used by the co-delivered photosensitizer chlorin e6 for the generation of cytotoxic singlet oxygen to kill glioma cells. Such a synergism ensures strong therapeutic effects against both glioma cell-line derived and patient-derived xenograft models.","Targeting cancer-associated metabolism is evolving as a promising approach for cancer therapy. Here, the authors generate cancer cell-membrane encapsulated nanoparticles to induce cell cycle arrest and cytotoxicity in lactate-high cancer cells, reducing tumourigensis in glioblastoma cell-line and patient-derived models.",2022-07-21
1269,Subsurface ocean warming preceded Heinrich Events,"Although the global environmental impact of Laurentide Ice-Sheet destabilizations on glacial climate during Heinrich Events is well-documented, the mechanism driving these ice-sheet instabilities remains elusive. Here we report foraminifera-based subsurface (~150 m water depth) ocean temperature and salinity reconstructions from a sediment core collected in the western subpolar North Atlantic, showing a consistent pattern of rapid subsurface ocean warming preceding the transition into each Heinrich Event identified in the same core of the last 27,000 years. These results provide the first solid evidence for the massive accumulation of ocean heat near the critical depth to trigger melting of marine-terminating portions of the Laurentide Ice Sheet around Labrador Sea followed by Heinrich Events. The repeated build-up of a subsurface heat reservoir in the subpolar Atlantic closely corresponds to times of weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, indicating a precursor role of ocean circulation changes for initiating abrupt ice-sheet instabilities during Heinrich Events. We infer that a weaker ocean circulation in future may result in accelerated interior-ocean warming of the subpolar Atlantic, which could be critical for the stability of modern, marine-terminating Arctic glaciers and the freshwater budget of the North Atlantic.","The mechanism driving past Laurentide Ice-Sheet instabilities remains elusive Here, the authors present a sediment record from the subpolar western North Atlantic and show that massive warming of the upper interior ocean was the likely trigger for repeated collapses of the Laurentide Ice-Sheet and iceberg discharge into the North Atlantic, known as Heinrich Events.",2022-07-21
1270,Population genomics of Group B Streptococcus reveals the genetics of neonatal disease onset and meningeal invasion,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS), or Streptococcus agalactiae, is a pathogen that causes preterm births, stillbirths, and acute invasive neonatal disease burden and mortality. Here, we investigate bacterial genetic signatures associated with disease onset time and meningeal tissue infection in acute invasive neonatal GBS disease. We carry out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1,338 GBS isolates from newborns with acute invasive disease; the isolates had been collected annually, for 30 years, through a national bacterial surveillance program in the Netherlands. After controlling for the population structure, we identify genetic variation within noncoding and coding regions, particularly the capsule biosynthesis locus, statistically associated with neonatal GBS disease onset time and meningeal invasion. Our findings highlight the impact of integrating microbial population genomics and clinical pathogen surveillance, and demonstrate the effect of GBS genetics on disease pathogenesis in neonates and infants.","Group B Streptococcus (GBS) causes neonatal disease and mortality worldwide.

1271,Decreasing surface albedo signifies a growing importance of clouds for Greenland Ice Sheet meltwater production,"Clouds regulate the Greenland Ice Sheet’s surface energy balance through the competing effects of shortwave radiation shading and longwave radiation trapping. However, the relative importance of these effects within Greenland’s narrow ablation zone, where nearly all meltwater runoff is produced, remains poorly quantified. Here we use machine learning to merge MODIS, CloudSat, and CALIPSO satellite observations to produce a high-resolution cloud radiative effect product. For the period 2003–2020, we find that a 1% change in cloudiness has little effect (±0.16 W m−2) on summer net radiative fluxes in the ablation zone because the warming and cooling effects of clouds compensate. However, by 2100 (SSP5-8.5 scenario), radiative fluxes in the ablation zone will become more than twice as sensitive (±0.39 W m−2) to changes in cloudiness due to reduced surface albedo. Accurate representation of clouds will therefore become increasingly important for forecasting the Greenland Ice Sheet’s contribution to global sea-level rise.",Here the authors use remote sensing observations and machine learning to show that clouds will become increasingly important for determining the Greenland Ice Sheet’s contribution to global sea levels due to decreasing albedo in the ablation zone.,2022-07-21
1272,Assembly of planar chiral superlattices from achiral building blocks,"The spontaneous assembly of chiral structures from building blocks that lack chirality is fundamentally important for colloidal chemistry and has implications for the formation of advanced optical materials. Here, we find that purified achiral gold tetrahedron-shaped nanoparticles assemble into two-dimensional superlattices that exhibit planar chirality under a balance of repulsive electrostatic and attractive van der Waals and depletion forces. A model accounting for these interactions shows that the growth of planar structures is kinetically preferred over similar three-dimensional products, explaining their selective formation. Exploration and mapping of different packing symmetries demonstrates that the hexagonal chiral phase forms exclusively because of geometric constraints imposed by the presence of constituent tetrahedra with sharp tips. A formation mechanism is proposed in which the chiral phase nucleates from within a related 2D achiral phase by clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of tetrahedra about their central axis. These results lay the scientific foundation for the high-throughput assembly of planar chiral metamaterials.","The formation of nanostructures with chiral symmetry often requires chiral directing agents at a smaller length scale. Here, the authors report the self-assembly of 2D chiral superlattices from achiral tetrahedron-shaped building blocks.",2022-07-21
1273,Spectral signatures of excess-proton waiting and transfer-path dynamics in aqueous hydrochloric acid solutions,"The theoretical basis for linking spectral signatures of hydrated excess protons with microscopic proton-transfer mechanisms has so far relied on normal-mode analysis. We introduce trajectory-decomposition techniques to analyze the excess-proton dynamics in ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations of aqueous hydrochloric-acid solutions beyond the normal-mode scenario. We show that the actual proton transfer between two water molecules involves for relatively large water-water separations crossing of a free-energy barrier and thus is not a normal mode, rather it is characterized by two non-vibrational time scales: Firstly, the broadly distributed waiting time for transfer to occur with a mean value of 200–300 fs, which leads to a broad and weak shoulder in the absorption spectrum around 100 cm−1, consistent with our experimental THz spectra. Secondly, the mean duration of a transfer event of about 14 fs, which produces a rather well-defined spectral contribution around 1200 cm−1 and agrees in location and width with previous experimental mid-infrared spectra.",The spectroscopic signatures of excess protons in HCl solutions are studied by ab initio simulations and THz experiments.

The advent of this reaction on ancient Earth changed its environment by generating an oxygenic atmosphere. However, how oxygen evolution originated during the PSII evolution remains unknown. Here, we characterize the site-directed mutants at the carboxylate ligands to the Mn cluster in cyanobacterial PSII. A His residue replaced for D1-D170 is found to be post-translationally converted to the original Asp to recover oxygen evolution. Gln/Asn residues in the mutants at D1-E189/D1-D342 are also converted to Glu/Asp, suggesting that amino-acid conversion is a common phenomenon at the ligand sites of the Mn cluster. We hypothesize that post-translational generation of carboxylate ligands in ancestral PSII could have led to the formation of a primitive form of the Mn cluster capable of partial water oxidation, which could have played a crucial role in the evolutionary process of photosynthetic oxygen evolution.","How photosynthetic oxygen evolution is originated on ancient Earth is unknown. Here, the authors find that some amino acid residues at the ligand sites of the Mn cluster can be posttranslationally converted to the original carboxylate residues, which could have contributed to the evolutionary process of photosynthetic oxygen evolution.",2022-07-21
1275,Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU) safeguards the developing mouse cortex,"HNRNPU encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, which participates in RNA splicing and chromatin organization. Microdeletions in the 1q44 locus encompassing HNRNPU and other genes and point mutations in HNRNPU cause brain disorders, including early-onset seizures and severe intellectual disability. We aimed to understand HNRNPU’s roles in the developing brain. Our work revealed that HNRNPU loss of function leads to rapid cell death of both postmitotic neurons and neural progenitors, with an apparent higher sensitivity of the latter. Further, expression and alternative splicing of multiple genes involved in cell survival, cell motility, and synapse formation are affected following Hnrnpu’s conditional truncation. Finally, we identified pharmaceutical and genetic agents that can partially reverse the loss of cortical structures in Hnrnpu mutated embryonic brains, ameliorate radial neuronal migration defects and rescue cultured neural progenitors’ cell death.",HNRNPU is an RNA splicing protein associated with brain disorders such as early onset seizures. Here they show that HNRNPU functions to maintain neural progenitors and their progeny by regulating splicing of key neuronal genes.,2022-07-21
1276,A phase I/II study of triple-mutated oncolytic herpes virus G47∆ in patients with progressive glioblastoma,"Here, we report the results of a phase I/II, single-arm study (UMIN-CTR Clinical Trial Registry UMIN000002661) assessing the safety (primary endpoint) of G47∆, a triple-mutated oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1, in Japanese adults with recurrent/progressive glioblastoma despite radiation and temozolomide therapies. G47Δ was administered intratumorally at 3 × 108 pfu (low dose) or 1 × 109 pfu (set dose), twice to identical coordinates within 5–14 days. Thirteen patients completed treatment (low dose, n = 3; set dose, n = 10). Adverse events occurred in 12/13 patients. The most common G47Δ-related adverse events were fever, headache and vomiting. Secondary endpoint was the efficacy. Median overall survival was 7.3 (95%CI 6.2–15.2) months and the 1-year survival rate was 38.5%, both from the last G47∆ administration. Median progression-free survival was 8 (95%CI 7–34) days from the last G47∆ administration, mainly due to immediate enlargement of the contrast-enhanced area of the target lesion on MRI. Three patients survived >46 months. One complete response (low dose) and one partial response (set dose) were seen at 2 years. Based on biopsies, post-administration MRI features (injection site contrast-enhancement clearing and entire tumor enlargement) likely reflected tumor cell destruction via viral replication and lymphocyte infiltration towards tumor cells, the latter suggesting the mechanism for “immunoprogression” characteristic to this therapy. This study shows that G47Δ is safe for treating recurrent/progressive glioblastoma and warrants further clinical development.","G47Δ is a third-generation, triple-mutated oncolytic HSV-1 that has demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical studies. Here the authors report the results of a phase I/II study of G47Δ in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma.",2022-07-21
1277,Sulfur and chlorine budgets control the ore fertility of arc magmas,"Continental arc magmas supply the ore-forming element budget of most globally important porphyry-type ore deposits. However, the processes enabling certain arc segments to preferentially generate giant porphyry deposits remain highly debated. Here we evaluate the large-scale covariation of key ore-forming constituents in this setting by studying silicate melt inclusions in volcanic rocks from a fertile-to-barren segment of the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone (33–40 °S). We show that the north-to-south, fertile-to-barren gradient is characterized by a northward increase in S and Cl concentrations and a simultaneous decrease in Cu. Consequently, we suggest that the concentration of S and Cl rather than the concentration of ore metals regulates magmatic-hydrothermal ore fertility, and that the loss of volatiles prior to arrival in the upper crust impacts ore-forming potential more than magmatic sulfide saturation-related ore metal scavenging.","Earth’s largest copper deposits form in continental arcs, yet it is not well understood what determines whether a magmatic system generates economic mineralization or not. Here the authors show that the abundance of chlorine and sulfur, rather than the abundance of ore metals controls magmatic ore fertility.",2022-07-21
1278,Surrogate- and invariance-boosted contrastive learning for data-scarce applications in science,"Deep learning techniques have been increasingly applied to the natural sciences, e.g., for property prediction and optimization or material discovery. A fundamental ingredient of such approaches is the vast quantity of labeled data needed to train the model. This poses severe challenges in data-scarce settings where obtaining labels requires substantial computational or labor resources. Noting that problems in natural sciences often benefit from easily obtainable auxiliary information sources, we introduce surrogate- and invariance-boosted contrastive learning (SIB-CL), a deep learning framework which incorporates three inexpensive and easily obtainable auxiliary information sources to overcome data scarcity. Specifically, these are: abundant unlabeled data, prior knowledge of symmetries or invariances, and surrogate data obtained at near-zero cost. We demonstrate SIB-CL’s effectiveness and generality on various scientific problems, e.g., predicting the density-of-states of 2D photonic crystals and solving the 3D time-independent Schrödinger equation. SIB-CL consistently results in orders of magnitude reduction in the number of labels needed to achieve the same network accuracies.",Deep learning techniques usually require a large quantity of training data and may be challenging for scarce datasets. The authors propose a framework that involves contrastive and transfer learning and reduces data requirements for training while keeping the prediction accuracy.,2022-07-21
1279,Dynamic influences on static measures of metacognition,"Humans differ in their capability to judge choice accuracy via confidence judgments. Popular signal detection theoretic measures of metacognition, such as M-ratio, do not consider the dynamics of decision making. This can be problematic if response caution is shifted to alter the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Such shifts could induce unaccounted-for sources of variation in the assessment of metacognition. Instead, evidence accumulation frameworks consider decision making, including the computation of confidence, as a dynamic process unfolding over time. Using simulations, we show a relation between response caution and M-ratio. We then show the same pattern in human participants explicitly instructed to focus on speed or accuracy. Finally, this association between M-ratio and response caution is also present across four datasets without any reference towards speed. In contrast, when data are analyzed with a dynamic measure of metacognition, v-ratio, there is no effect of speed-accuracy tradeoff.","The authors show that current measures of metacognition are confounded with response caution, both in simulations and empirical data. They propose an alternative dynamic measure of metacognition.",2022-07-21
1280,A metagenomic DNA sequencing assay that is robust against environmental DNA contamination,"Metagenomic DNA sequencing is a powerful tool to characterize microbial communities but is sensitive to environmental DNA contamination, in particular when applied to samples with low microbial biomass. Here, we present Sample-Intrinsic microbial DNA Found by Tagging and sequencing (SIFT-seq) a metagenomic sequencing assay that is robust against environmental DNA contamination introduced during sample preparation. The core idea of SIFT-seq is to tag the DNA in the sample prior to DNA isolation and library preparation with a label that can be recorded by DNA sequencing. Any contaminating DNA that is introduced in the sample after tagging can then be bioinformatically identified and removed. We applied SIFT-seq to screen for infections from microorganisms with low burden in blood and urine, to identify COVID-19 co-infection, to characterize the urinary microbiome, and to identify microbial DNA signatures of sepsis and inflammatory bowel disease in blood.","The accuracy of metagenomic DNA sequencing is limited by environmental DNA contamination. Here, the authors develop and test SIFT-seq, a metagenomic DNA sequencing assay that allows to identify and remove environmental DNA contamination introduced during sample preparation.",2022-07-21
1281,Targeting retinoic acid receptor alpha-corepressor interaction activates chaperone-mediated autophagy and protects against retinal degeneration,"Chaperone-mediated autophagy activity, essential in the cellular defense against proteotoxicity, declines with age, and preventing this decline in experimental genetic models has proven beneficial. Here, we have identified the mechanism of action of selective chaperone-mediated autophagy activators previously developed by our group and have leveraged that information to generate orally bioavailable chaperone-mediated autophagy activators with favorable brain exposure. Chaperone-mediated autophagy activating molecules stabilize the interaction between retinoic acid receptor alpha - a known endogenous inhibitor of chaperone-mediated autophagy - and its co-repressor, nuclear receptor corepressor 1, resulting in changes of a discrete subset of the retinoic acid receptor alpha transcriptional program that leads to selective chaperone-mediated autophagy activation. Chaperone-mediated autophagy activators molecules activate this pathway in vivo and ameliorate retinal degeneration in a retinitis pigmentosa mouse model. Our findings reveal a mechanism for pharmacological targeting of chaperone-mediated autophagy activation and suggest a therapeutic strategy for retinal degeneration.",Gomez-Sintes et al. have developed small molecules that selectively activate chaperone-mediated autophagy by stabilizing the interaction between retinoic acid receptor alpha and its co-repressor N-CoR1. They demonstrate the protective effect of boosting chaperone-mediated autophagy against retinal degeneration.,2022-07-21
1282,A nationwide questionnaire study of post-acute symptoms and health problems after SARS-CoV-2 infection in Denmark,"A considerable number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 continue to experience symptoms after the acute phase. Here, we report findings from a nationwide questionnaire study in Denmark including 61,002 RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 91,878 test-negative controls aged 15-years or older. Six to twelve months after the test, the risks of 18 out of 21 symptoms were elevated among test-positives. The largest adjusted risk differences (RD) were observed for dysosmia (RD = 10.92%, 95% CI 10.68–11.21%), dysgeusia (RD = 8.68%, 95% CI 8.43–8.93%), fatigue/exhaustion (RD = 8.43%, 95%CI 8.14–8.74%), dyspnea (RD = 4.87%, 95% CI 4.65–5.09%) and reduced strength in arms/legs (RD = 4.68%, 95% CI 4.45–4.89%). During the period from the test and until completion of the questionnaire, new diagnoses of anxiety (RD = 1.15%, 95% CI 0.95–1.34%) or depression (RD = 1.00%, 95% CI 0.81–1.19%) were also more common among test-positives. Even in a population where the majority of test-positives were not hospitalized, a considerable proportion experiences symptoms up to 12 months after infection. Being female or middle-aged increases risks.","The health impacts associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are still not well understood. Here, the authors report findings from a survey of ~150,000 people in Denmark, and identify elevated risks associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for a range of acute and post-acute symptoms and new diagnoses.",2022-07-21
1283,Detection of neutralizing antibodies against multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains in dried blood spots using cell-free PCR,"An easily implementable serological assay to accurately detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibodies is urgently needed to better track herd immunity, vaccine efficacy and vaccination rates. Herein, we report the Split-Oligonucleotide Neighboring Inhibition Assay (SONIA) which uses real-time qPCR to measure the ability of neutralizing antibodies to block binding between DNA-barcoded viral spike protein subunit 1 and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor protein. The SONIA neutralizing antibody assay using finger-prick dried blood spots displays 91–97% sensitivity and 100% specificity in comparison to the live-virus neutralization assays using matched serum specimens for multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants-of-concern. The multiplex version of this neutralizing antibody assay, using easily collectable finger-prick dried blood spots, can be a valuable tool to help reveal the impact of age, pre-existing health conditions, waning immunity, different vaccination schemes and the emergence of new variants-of-concern.","Neutralizing antibodies are critical for conferring immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, Dahn et al. report a PCR assay termed SONIA (Split-Oligonucleotide Neighboring Inhibition Assay) for measuring neutralizing antibodies against multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains in fingerprick dried blood spot samples.",2022-07-21
1284,Mechanism of threonine ADP-ribosylation of F-actin by a Tc toxin,"Tc toxins deliver toxic enzymes into host cells by a unique injection mechanism. One of these enzymes is the actin ADP-ribosyltransferase TccC3, whose activity leads to the clustering of the cellular cytoskeleton and ultimately cell death. Here, we show in atomic detail how TccC3 modifies actin. We find that the ADP-ribosyltransferase does not bind to G-actin but interacts with two consecutive actin subunits of F-actin. The binding of TccC3 to F-actin occurs via an induced-fit mechanism that facilitates access of NAD+ to the nucleotide binding pocket. The following nucleophilic substitution reaction results in the transfer of ADP-ribose to threonine-148 of F-actin. We demonstrate that this site-specific modification of F-actin prevents its interaction with depolymerization factors, such as cofilin, which impairs actin network turnover and leads to steady actin polymerization. Our findings reveal in atomic detail a mechanism of action of a bacterial toxin through specific targeting and modification of F-actin.","Entomopathogenic bacteria used for pest control secrete potent Tc toxins. Here, the authors combine biochemistry, solution and solid-state NMR spectroscopy and cryo-EM to show in atomic detail how the toxin disrupts the host cell cytoskeleton and kills the target cell.",2022-07-20
1285,Pseudomonas aeruginosa SutA wedges RNAP lobe domain open to facilitate promoter DNA unwinding,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pae) SutA adapts bacteria to hypoxia and nutrition-limited environment during chronic infection by increasing transcription activity of an RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme comprising the stress-responsive σ factor σS (RNAP-σS). SutA shows no homology to previously characterized RNAP-binding proteins. The structure and mode of action of SutA remain unclear. Here we determined cryo-EM structures of Pae RNAP-σS holoenzyme, Pae RNAP-σS holoenzyme complexed with SutA, and Pae RNAP-σS transcription initiation complex comprising SutA. The structures show SutA pinches RNAP-β protrusion and facilitates promoter unwinding by wedging RNAP-β lobe open. Our results demonstrate that SutA clears an energetic barrier to facilitate promoter unwinding of RNAP-σS holoenzyme.","SutA is a transcription factor which increases transcription activity of an RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here, authors present cryo-EM structures of SutA-bound RNAP-σS holoenzyme and SutA-bound transcription initiation complex, which reveals SutA wedging the RNAP-β lobe open to aid unwinding.",2022-07-20
1286,A Bayesian approach to infer recombination patterns in coronaviruses,"As shown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods are essential tools to study the spread and evolution of pathogens. One of the central assumptions of these methods is that the shared history of pathogens isolated from different hosts can be described by a branching phylogenetic tree. Recombination breaks this assumption. This makes it problematic to apply phylogenetic methods to study recombining pathogens, including, for example, coronaviruses. Here, we introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach that allows inference of recombination networks from genetic sequence data under a template switching model of recombination. Using this method, we first show that recombination is extremely common in the evolutionary history of SARS-like coronaviruses. We then show how recombination rates across the genome of the human seasonal coronaviruses 229E, OC43 and NL63 vary with rates of adaptation. This suggests that recombination could be beneficial to fitness of human seasonal coronaviruses. Additionally, this work sets the stage for Bayesian phylogenetic tracking of the spread and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the future, even as recombinant viruses become prevalent.","Genetic recombination can confound standard phylogenetic approaches. Here, the authors present a method to reconstruct virus recombination networks, and show the importance of recombination in shaping the ongoing evolution of SARS-like, MERS and 3 human seasonal coronaviruses.",2022-07-20
1287,Kinesin-8-specific loop-2 controls the dual activities of the motor domain according to tubulin protofilament shape,"Kinesin-8s are dual-activity motor proteins that can move processively on microtubules and depolymerize microtubule plus-ends, but their mechanism of combining these distinct activities remains unclear. We addressed this by obtaining cryo-EM structures (2.6–3.9 Å) of Candida albicans Kip3 in different catalytic states on the microtubule lattice and on a curved microtubule end mimic. We also determined a crystal structure of microtubule-unbound CaKip3-ADP (2.0 Å) and analyzed the biochemical activity of CaKip3 and kinesin-1 mutants. These data reveal that the microtubule depolymerization activity of kinesin-8 originates from conformational changes of its motor core that are amplified by dynamic contacts between its extended loop-2 and tubulin. On curved microtubule ends, loop-1 inserts into preceding motor domains, forming head-to-tail arrays of kinesin-8s that complement loop-2 contacts with curved tubulin and assist depolymerization. On straight tubulin protofilaments in the microtubule lattice, loop-2-tubulin contacts inhibit conformational changes in the motor core, but in the ADP-Pi state these contacts are relaxed, allowing neck-linker docking for motility. We propose that these tubulin shape-induced alternations between pro-microtubule-depolymerization and pro-motility kinesin states, regulated by loop-2, are the key to the dual activity of kinesin-8 motors.",Kinesin-8s are dual-activity motor proteins that can move processively on microtubules and depolymerize microtubule plus-ends. This study shows how kinesin-8s alternate between a promotility and a pro-microtubule-depolymerization state via their tubulin shape-sensing loop-2 region.,2022-07-20
1288,A dynamic assembly-induced emissive system for advanced information encryption with time-dependent security,"The development of advanced materials for information encryption with time-dependent features is essential to meet the increasing demand on encryption security. Herein, smart materials with orthogonal and temporal encryption properties are successfully developed based on a dynamic assembly-induced multicolour supramolecular system. Multicolour fluorescence, including blue, orange and even white light emissions, is achieved by controlling the supramolecular assembly of pyrene derivatives by tailoring the solvent composition. By taking advantage of the tuneable fluorescence, dynamically controlled information encryption materials with orthogonal encryption functions, e.g., 3D codes, are successfully developed. Moreover, time-dependent information encryption materials, such as temporal multi-information displays and 4D codes, are also developed by enabling the fluorescence-controllable supramolecular system in the solid phase, showing multiple pieces of information on a time scale, and the correct information can be identified only at a specified time. This work provides an inspiring point for the design of information encryption materials with higher security requirements.","The development of advanced materials for information encryption is desirable. Here, the authors report materials that enable orthogonal and temporal encryption of information via dynamic assembly-induced multicolor pyrene-based supramolecular systems.",2022-07-20
1289,In-plane strain engineering in ultrathin noble metal nanosheets boosts the intrinsic electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity,"Strain has been shown to modulate the electronic structure of noble metal nanomaterials and alter their catalytic performances. Since strain is spatially dependent, it is challenging to expose the active strained interfaces by structural engineering with atomic precision. Herein, we report a facile method to manipulate the planar strain in ultrathin noble metal nanosheets by constructing amorphous–crystalline phase boundaries that can expose the active strained interfaces. Geometric-phase analysis and electron diffraction profile demonstrate the in-plane amorphous–crystalline boundaries can induce about 4% surface tensile strain in the nanosheets. The strained Ir nanosheets display substantially enhanced intrinsic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysis with a turnover frequency value 4.5-fold higher than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations verify that the tensile strain optimizes the d-band states and hydrogen adsorption properties of the strained Ir nanosheets to improve catalysis. Furthermore, the in-plane strain engineering method is demonstrated to be a general approach to boost the hydrogen evolution performance of Ru and Rh nanosheets.","While inducing strain to noble metal nanomaterials can modulate catalytic activities, the strain is often spatially dependent. Here, authors manipulate the planar strain in noble metal nanosheets for hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis by constructing amorphous–crystalline phase boundaries.",2022-07-20
1290,Model-guided engineering of DNA sequences with predictable site-specific recombination rates,"Site-specific recombination (SSR) is an important tool in synthetic biology, but its applications are limited by the inability to predictably tune SSR reaction rates. Facile rate manipulation could be achieved by modifying the DNA substrate sequence; however, this approach lacks rational design principles. Here, we develop an integrated experimental and computational method to engineer the DNA attachment sequence attP for predictably modulating the inversion reaction mediated by the recombinase Bxb1. After developing a qPCR method to measure SSR reaction rate, we design, select, and sequence attP libraries to inform a machine-learning model that computes Bxb1 inversion rate as a function of attP sequence. We use this model to predict reaction rates of attP variants in vitro and demonstrate their utility in gene circuit design in Escherichia coli. Our high-throughput, model-guided approach for rationally tuning SSR reaction rates enhances our understanding of recombinase function and expands the synthetic biology toolbox.","Site-specific recombination (SSR) is an important tool in synthetic biology, but its applications are limited by the inability to predictably tune SSR reaction rates.

1291,Longest sediment flows yet measured show how major rivers connect efficiently to deep sea,"Here we show how major rivers can efficiently connect to the deep-sea, by analysing the longest runout sediment flows (of any type) yet measured in action on Earth. These seafloor turbidity currents originated from the Congo River-mouth, with one flow travelling >1,130 km whilst accelerating from 5.2 to 8.0 m/s. In one year, these turbidity currents eroded 1,338-2,675 [>535-1,070] Mt of sediment from one submarine canyon, equivalent to 19–37 [>7–15] % of annual suspended sediment flux from present-day rivers. It was known earthquakes trigger canyon-flushing flows. We show river-floods also generate canyon-flushing flows, primed by rapid sediment-accumulation at the river-mouth, and sometimes triggered by spring tides weeks to months post-flood. It is demonstrated that strongly erosional turbidity currents self-accelerate, thereby travelling much further, validating a long-proposed theory. These observations explain highly-efficient organic carbon transfer, and have important implications for hazards to seabed cables, or deep-sea impacts of terrestrial climate change.","This paper analyses the longest sediment flows measured in action on Earth. These seabed flows were caused by floods and spring tides, and flushed prodigious sediment and carbon volumes into the deep sea, as they accelerated for a thousand kilometres.",2022-07-20
1292,Disruption of tubulin-alpha4a polyglutamylation prevents aggregation of hyper-phosphorylated tau and microglia activation in mice,"Dissociation of hyper-phosphorylated Tau from neuronal microtubules and its pathological aggregates, are hallmarks in the etiology of tauopathies. The Tau-microtubule interface is subject to polyglutamylation, a reversible posttranslational modification, increasing negative charge at tubulin C-terminal tails. Here, we asked whether tubulin polyglutamylation may contribute to Tau pathology in vivo. Since polyglutamylases modify various proteins other than tubulin, we generated a knock-in mouse carrying gene mutations to abolish Tuba4a polyglutamylation in a substrate-specific manner. We found that Tuba4a lacking C-terminal polyglutamylation prevents the binding of Tau and GSK3 kinase to neuronal microtubules, thereby strongly reducing phospho-Tau levels. Notably, crossbreeding of the Tuba4a knock-in mouse with the hTau tauopathy model, expressing a human Tau transgene, reversed hyper-phosphorylation and oligomerization of Tau and normalized microglia activation in brain. Our data highlight tubulin polyglutamylation as a potential therapeutic strategy in fighting tauopathies.","Pathologic oligomerization of hyper-phosphorylated Tau is a hallmark of tauopathies. Here the authors show that the loss of tubulin a4 polyglutamylation reverses tau hyperphosphorylation, oligomerization and microglia activation in a tauopathy mouse.",2022-07-20
1293,Long-range charge carrier mobility in metal halide perovskite thin-films and single crystals via transient photo-conductivity,"Charge carrier mobility is a fundamental property of semiconductor materials that governs many electronic device characteristics. For metal halide perovskites, a wide range of charge carrier mobilities have been reported using different techniques. Mobilities are often estimated via transient methods assuming an initial charge carrier population after pulsed photoexcitation and measurement of photoconductivity via non-contact or contact techniques. For nanosecond to millisecond transient methods, early-time recombination and exciton-to-free-carrier ratio hinder accurate determination of free-carrier population after photoexcitation. By considering both effects, we estimate long-range charge carrier mobilities over a wide range of photoexcitation densities via transient photoconductivity measurements. We determine long-range mobilities for FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3, (FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Cs0.05Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 and CH3NH3PbI3-xClx polycrystalline films in the range of 0.3 to 6.7 cm2 V−1 s−1. We demonstrate how our data-processing technique can also reveal more precise mobility estimates from non-contact time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements. Importantly, our results indicate that the processing of polycrystalline films significantly affects their long-range mobility.",Charge carrier mobility is a fundamental property of semiconductors. The authors of this study demonstrate a novel way to estimate long-range mobilities of perovskite thin-films and single crystals by taking early-time carrier dynamics into account.,2022-07-20
1294,Energy-efficient pathway for selectively exciting solute molecules to high vibrational states via solvent vibration-polariton pumping,"Selectively exciting target molecules to high vibrational states is inefficient in the liquid phase, which restricts the use of IR pumping to catalyze ground-state chemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate that this inefficiency can sometimes be solved by confining the liquid to an optical cavity under vibrational strong coupling conditions. For a liquid solution of 13CO2 solute in a 12CO2 solvent, cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that exciting a polariton (hybrid light-matter state) of the solvent with an intense laser pulse, under suitable resonant conditions, may lead to a very strong (>3 quanta) and ultrafast (<1 ps) excitation of the solute, even though the solvent ends up being barely excited. By contrast, outside a cavity the same input pulse fluence can excite the solute by only half a vibrational quantum and the selectivity of excitation is low. Our finding is robust under different cavity volumes, which may lead to observable cavity enhancement on IR photochemical reactions in Fabry–Pérot cavities.","Hybrid light-matter states formed in the strong light-matter coupling regime can alter the molecular ground-state reactivity. Here, Li et al. computationally demonstrate that pumping a collection of solvent molecules forming hybrid vibrational light-matter states in an optical cavity can excite solute molecules to very high excited states.",2022-07-20
1295,An epigenome atlas of neural progenitors within the embryonic mouse forebrain,"A comprehensive characterization of epigenomic organization in the embryonic mouse forebrain will enhance our understanding of neurodevelopment and provide insight into mechanisms of neurological disease. Here we collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles from four distinct neurogenic regions of the embryonic mouse forebrain using single nuclei ATAC-Seq (snATAC-Seq). We identified thousands of differentially accessible peaks, many restricted to distinct progenitor cell types or brain regions. We integrated snATAC-Seq and single cell transcriptome data to characterize changes of chromatin accessibility at enhancers and promoters with associated transcript abundance. Multi-modal integration of histone modifications (CUT&Tag and CUT&RUN), promoter-enhancer interactions (Capture-C) and high-order chromatin structure (Hi-C) extended these initial observations. This dataset reveals a diverse chromatin landscape with region-specific regulatory mechanisms and genomic interactions in distinct neurogenic regions of the embryonic mouse brain and represents an extensive public resource of a ‘ground truth’ epigenomic landscape at this critical stage of neurogenesis.","The authors took a multimodal approach to characterize the differential transcriptome and epigenetic landscape between distinct regions of the embryonic mouse forebrain, revealing many unexplored presumptive promoter-enhancer interactions.",2022-07-20
1296,Inactivation of Sirt6 ameliorates muscular dystrophy in mdx mice by releasing suppression of utrophin expression,"The NAD+-dependent SIRT1-7 family of protein deacetylases plays a vital role in various molecular pathways related to stress response, DNA repair, aging and metabolism. Increased activity of individual sirtuins often exerts beneficial effects in pathophysiological conditions whereas reduced activity is usually associated with disease conditions. Here, we demonstrate that SIRT6 deacetylates H3K56ac in myofibers to suppress expression of utrophin, a dystrophin-related protein stabilizing the sarcolemma in absence of dystrophin. Inactivation of Sirt6 in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice reduced damage of myofibers, ameliorated dystrophic muscle pathology, and improved muscle function, leading to attenuated activation of muscle stem cells (MuSCs). ChIP-seq and locus-specific recruitment of SIRT6 using a CRISPR-dCas9/gRNA approach revealed that SIRT6 is critical for removal of H3K56ac at the Downstream utrophin Enhancer (DUE), which is indispensable for utrophin expression. We conclude that epigenetic manipulation of utrophin expression is a promising approach for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).","Utrophin is a dystrophin-related protein stabilizing the sarcolemma in absence of dystrophin. Here the authors report that inactivation of the protein deacetylase SIRT6, involved in the deacetylation of the epigenetic mark H3K56ac in muscle cells, increases expression of utrophin and ameliorates dystrophic muscle pathology in mice.",2022-07-20
1297,Neuropilin 1 and its inhibitory ligand mini-tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase inversely regulate VE-cadherin turnover and vascular permeability,"The formation of a functional blood vessel network relies on the ability of endothelial cells (ECs) to dynamically rearrange their adhesive contacts in response to blood flow and guidance cues, such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3s). Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) is essential for blood vessel development, independently of its ligands VEGF-A and SEMA3, through poorly understood mechanisms. Grounding on unbiased proteomic analysis, we report here that NRP1 acts as an endocytic chaperone primarily for adhesion receptors on the surface of unstimulated ECs. NRP1 localizes at adherens junctions (AJs) where, interacting with VE-cadherin, promotes its basal internalization-dependent turnover and favors vascular permeability initiated by histamine in both cultured ECs and mice. We identify a splice variant of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (mini-WARS) as an unconventionally secreted extracellular inhibitory ligand of NRP1 that, by stabilizing it at the AJs, slows down both VE-cadherin turnover and histamine-elicited endothelial leakage. Thus, our work shows a role for NRP1 as a major regulator of AJs plasticity and reveals how mini-WARS acts as a physiological NRP1 inhibitory ligand in the control of VE-cadherin endocytic turnover and vascular permeability.","Functional vascular tree formation is a key step in many contexts, such as cancer, and Neuropilin1 (NRP1) has been associated with adhesion receptor endocytic turnover. Here, authors show NRP1 and its mini-WARS ligand play a role in reducing endothelial permeability.",2022-07-20
1298,Thalamo-hippocampal pathway regulates incidental memory capacity in mice,"Incidental memory can be challenged by increasing either the retention delay or the memory load. The dorsal hippocampus (dHP) appears to help with both consolidation from short-term (STM) to long-term memory (LTM), and higher memory loads, but the mechanism is not fully understood. Here we find that female mice, despite having the same STM capacity of 6 objects and higher resistance to distraction in our different object recognition task (DOT), when tested over 1 h or 24 h delays appear to transfer to LTM only 4 objects, whereas male mice have an STM capacity of 6 objects in this task. In male mice the dHP shows greater activation (as measured by c-Fos expression), whereas female mice show greater activation of the ventral midline thalamus (VMT). Optogenetic inhibition of the VMT-dHP pathway during off-line memory consolidation enables 6-object LTM retention in females, while chemogenetic VMT-activation impairs it in males. Thus, removing or enhancing sub-cortical inhibitory control over the hippocampus leads to differences in incidental memory.","Incidental memory is affected by retention delay, and by memory load. Here the authors show that female and male mice process high memory load through different activation of thalamic-cortical pathways, that makes their incidental memory resistant to distraction and to memory decay, respectively.",2022-07-20
1299,Drivers and trends of global soil microbial carbon over two decades,"Soil microorganisms are central to sustain soil functions and services, like carbon and nutrient cycling. Currently, we only have a limited understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of soil microorganisms, restricting our ability to assess long-term effects of climate and land-cover change on microbial roles in soil biogeochemistry. This study assesses the temporal trends in soil microbial biomass carbon and identifies the main drivers of biomass change regionally and globally to detect the areas sensitive to these environmental factors. Here, we combined a global soil microbial biomass carbon data set, random forest modelling, and environmental layers to predict spatial-temporal dynamics of microbial biomass carbon stocks from 1992 to 2013. Soil microbial biomass carbon stocks decreased globally by 3.4 ± 3.0% (mean ± 95% CI) between 1992 and 2013 for the predictable regions, equivalent to 149 Mt being lost over the period, or ~1‰ of soil C. Northern areas with high soil microbial carbon stocks experienced the strongest decrease, mostly driven by increasing temperatures. In contrast, land-cover change was a weaker global driver of change in microbial carbon, but had, in some cases, important regional effects.","Soil microbial carbon is central to soil functions and services, but its spatial-temporal dynamics are unclear. Here the authors show global trends in soil microbial carbon, which suggests a global decrease in soil microbial carbon, mostly driven by temperature increases in northern areas.",2022-07-20
1300,Polycomb-lamina antagonism partitions heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery,"The genome can be divided into two spatially segregated compartments, A and B, which partition active and inactive chromatin states. While constitutive heterochromatin is predominantly located within the B compartment near the nuclear lamina, facultative heterochromatin marked by H3K27me3 spans both compartments. How epigenetic modifications, compartmentalization, and lamina association collectively maintain heterochromatin architecture remains unclear. Here we develop Lamina-Inducible Methylation and Hi-C (LIMe-Hi-C) to jointly measure chromosome conformation, DNA methylation, and lamina positioning. Through LIMe-Hi-C, we identify topologically distinct sub-compartments with high levels of H3K27me3 and differing degrees of lamina association. Inhibition of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) reveals that H3K27me3 is essential for sub-compartment segregation. Unexpectedly, PRC2 inhibition promotes lamina association and constitutive heterochromatin spreading into H3K27me3-marked B sub-compartment regions. Consistent with this repositioning, genes originally marked with H3K27me3 in the B compartment, but not the A compartment, remain largely repressed, suggesting that constitutive heterochromatin spreading can compensate for H3K27me3 loss at a transcriptional level. These findings demonstrate that Polycomb sub-compartments and their antagonism with lamina association are fundamental features of genome structure. More broadly, by jointly measuring nuclear position and Hi-C contacts, our study demonstrates how compartmentalization and lamina association represent distinct but interdependent modes of heterochromatin regulation.","Here the authors developed ‘Lamina-Inducible Methylation and Hi-C’ (LIMe-Hi-C) to simultaneously measure chromosome conformation, DNA methylation, and nuclear lamina positioning. Application of the method revealed dynamic changes upon PRC2 inhibition and an essential function of H3K27me3 in regulating sub-compartments and lamina association.",2022-07-20
1301,Interplay between topological valley and quantum Hall edge transport,"An established way of realising topologically protected states in a two-dimensional electron gas is by applying a perpendicular magnetic field thus creating quantum Hall edge channels. In electrostatically gapped bilayer graphene intriguingly, even in the absence of a magnetic field, topologically protected electronic states can emerge at naturally occurring stacking domain walls. While individually both types of topologically protected states have been investigated, their intriguing interplay remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the interplay between topological domain wall states and quantum Hall edge transport within the eight-fold degenerate zeroth Landau level of high-quality suspended bilayer graphene. We find that the two-terminal conductance remains approximately constant for low magnetic fields throughout the distinct quantum Hall states since the conduction channels are traded between domain wall and device edges. For high magnetic fields, however, we observe evidence of transport suppression at the domain wall, which can be attributed to the emergence of spectral minigaps. This indicates that stacking domain walls potentially do not correspond to a topological domain wall in the order parameter.","In electrostatically-gapped bilayer graphene, topologically-protected states can emerge at naturally occurring stacking domain walls even in the absence of a magnetic field. Here, the authors describe the interplay between such domain wall states and quantum Hall edge transport within the eight-fold degenerate zeroth Landau level of suspended bilayer graphene.",2022-07-20
1302,The mechanism of replication stalling and recovery within repetitive DNA,"Accurate chromosomal DNA replication is essential to maintain genomic stability. Genetic evidence suggests that certain repetitive sequences impair replication, yet the underlying mechanism is poorly defined. Replication could be directly inhibited by the DNA template or indirectly, for example by DNA-bound proteins. Here, we reconstitute replication of mono-, di- and trinucleotide repeats in vitro using eukaryotic replisomes assembled from purified proteins. We find that structure-prone repeats are sufficient to impair replication. Whilst template unwinding is unaffected, leading strand synthesis is inhibited, leading to fork uncoupling. Synthesis through hairpin-forming repeats is rescued by replisome-intrinsic mechanisms, whereas synthesis of quadruplex-forming repeats requires an extrinsic accessory helicase. DNA-induced fork stalling is mechanistically similar to that induced by leading strand DNA lesions, highlighting structure-prone repeats as an important potential source of replication stress. Thus, we propose that our understanding of the cellular response to replication stress may also be applied to DNA-induced replication stalling.",DNA replication of repetitive sequences was recreated in a test tube using purified components. DNA alone was sufficient to induce stalling. Both stalling and recovery were dictated by the capacity of DNA to fold into unusual secondary structures.,2022-07-19
1303,An achromatic metafiber for focusing and imaging across the entire telecommunication range,"Dispersion engineering is essential to the performance of most modern optical systems including fiber-optic devices. Even though the chromatic dispersion of a meter-scale single-mode fiber used for endoscopic applications is negligible, optical lenses located on the fiber end face for optical focusing and imaging suffer from strong chromatic aberration. Here we present the design and nanoprinting of a 3D achromatic diffractive metalens on the end face of a single-mode fiber, capable of performing achromatic and polarization-insensitive focusing across the entire near-infrared telecommunication wavelength band ranging from 1.25 to 1.65 µm. This represents the whole single-mode domain of commercially used fibers. The unlocked height degree of freedom in a 3D nanopillar meta-atom largely increases the upper bound of the time-bandwidth product of an achromatic metalens up to 21.34, leading to a wide group delay modulation range spanning from −8 to 14 fs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of our compact and flexible achromatic metafiber for fiber-optic confocal imaging, capable of creating in-focus sharp images under broadband light illumination. These results may unleash the full potential of fiber meta-optics for widespread applications including hyperspectral endoscopic imaging, femtosecond laser-assisted treatment, deep tissue imaging, wavelength-multiplexing fiber-optic communications, fiber sensing, and fiber lasers.","The authors fabricate a 3D achromatic diffractive metalens on the end face of a single-mode fiber, useful for endoscopic applications. They demonstrate achromatic and polarization insensitive focusing across the entire near-infrared telecommunication wavelength band ranging from 1.25 to 1.65 µm.",2022-07-19
1304,α-Synuclein fibril-specific nanobody reduces prion-like α-synuclein spreading in mice,"Pathogenic α-synuclein (α-syn) is a prion-like protein that drives the pathogenesis of Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD). To target pathogenic α-syn preformed fibrils (PFF), here we designed extracellular disulfide bond-free synthetic nanobody libraries in yeast. Following selection, we identified a nanobody, PFFNB2, that can specifically recognize α-syn PFF over α-syn monomers. PFFNB2 cannot inhibit the aggregation of α-syn monomer, but can significantly dissociate α-syn fibrils. Furthermore, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-encoding EGFP fused to PFFNB2 (AAV-EGFP-PFFNB2) can inhibit PFF-induced α-syn serine 129 phosphorylation (pS129) in mouse primary cortical neurons, and prevent α-syn pathology spreading to the cortex in the transgenic mice expressing human wild type (WT) α-syn by intrastriatal-PFF injection. The pS129 immunoreactivity is negatively correlated with the expression of AAV-EGFP-PFFNB2. In conclusion, PFFNB2 holds a promise for mechanistic exploration and therapeutic development in α-syn-related pathogenesis.",Butler et al. selected disulfide bond-free nanobodies to target α-synuclein fibrils. Nanobody PFFNB2 was shown to disaggregate α-synuclein fibrils in vitro and inhibit α-synuclein pathology development in neuron cultures and mouse models.,2022-07-19
1305,Microporous polymer adsorptive membranes with high processing capacity for molecular separation,"Trade-off between permeability and nanometer-level selectivity is an inherent shortcoming of membrane-based separation of molecules, while most highly porous materials with high adsorption capacity lack solution processability and stability for achieving adsorption-based molecule separation. We hereby report a hydrophilic amidoxime modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity (AOPIM-1) as a membrane adsorption material to selectively adsorb and separate small organic molecules from water with ultrahigh processing capacity. The membrane adsorption capacity for Rhodamine B reaches 26.114 g m−2, 10–1000 times higher than previously reported adsorptive membranes. Meanwhile, the membrane achieves >99.9% removal of various nano-sized organic molecules with water flux 2 orders of magnitude higher than typical pressure-driven membranes of similar rejections. This work confirms the feasibility of microporous polymers for membrane adsorption with high capacity, and provides the possibility of adsorptive membranes for molecular separation.","Trade-off between permeability and nanometer-level selectivity is an inherent shortcoming of membrane-based separation of molecules.

1306,[11C]Martinostat PET analysis reveals reduced HDAC I availability in Alzheimer’s disease,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the brain accumulation of amyloid-β and tau proteins. A growing body of literature suggests that epigenetic dysregulations play a role in the interplay of hallmark proteinopathies with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Here, we aim to characterize an epigenetic dysregulation associated with the brain deposition of amyloid-β and tau proteins. Using positron emission tomography (PET) tracers selective for amyloid-β, tau, and class I histone deacetylase (HDAC I isoforms 1–3), we find that HDAC I levels are reduced in patients with AD. HDAC I PET reduction is associated with elevated amyloid-β PET and tau PET concentrations. Notably, HDAC I reduction mediates the deleterious effects of amyloid-β and tau on brain atrophy and cognitive impairment. HDAC I PET reduction is associated with 2-year longitudinal neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. We also find HDAC I reduction in the postmortem brain tissue of patients with AD and in a transgenic rat model expressing human amyloid-β plus tau pathology in the same brain regions identified in vivo using PET. These observations highlight HDAC I reduction as an element associated with AD pathophysiology.","The link between amyloid and tau proteins with Alzheimer’s disease progression remains unclear. Here, the authors propose HDACs I downregulation as an element linking the deleterious effects of brain proteinopathies with disease progression.",2022-07-19
1307,A brain precursor atlas reveals the acquisition of developmental-like states in adult cerebral tumours,"Human cerebral cancers are known to contain cell types resembling the varying stages of neural development. However, the basis of this association remains unclear. Here, we map the development of mouse cerebrum across the developmental time-course, from embryonic day 12.5 to postnatal day 365, performing single-cell transcriptomics on >100,000 cells. By comparing this reference atlas to single-cell data from >100 glial tumours of the adult and paediatric human cerebrum, we find that tumour cells have an expression signature that overlaps with temporally restricted, embryonic radial glial precursors (RGPs) and their immediate sublineages. Further, we demonstrate that prenatal transformation of RGPs in a genetic mouse model gives rise to adult cerebral tumours that show an embryonic/juvenile RGP identity. Together, these findings implicate the acquisition of embryonic-like states in the genesis of adult glioma, providing insight into the origins of human glioma, and identifying specific developmental cell types for therapeutic targeting.","The link between neural development and tumourigenesis in adult glioma remains unclear. Here, the authors monitor the developmental stages of Sox2 + /− stem cells from a mouse model using single-cell RNA sequencing and suggest the acquisition of embryonic-like states in the adult glioma development.",2022-07-19
1308,High-throughput fabrication of soft magneto-origami machines,"Soft magneto-active machines capable of magnetically controllable shape-morphing and locomotion have diverse promising applications such as untethered biomedical robots. However, existing soft magneto-active machines often have simple structures with limited functionalities and do not grant high-throughput production due to the convoluted fabrication technology. Here, we propose a facile fabrication strategy that transforms 2D magnetic sheets into 3D soft magneto-active machines with customized geometries by incorporating origami folding. Based on automated roll-to-roll processing, this approach allows for the high-throughput fabrication of soft magneto-origami machines with a variety of characteristics, including large-magnitude deploying, sequential folding into predesigned shapes, and multivariant actuation modes (e.g., contraction, bending, rotation, and rolling locomotion). We leverage these abilities to demonstrate a few potential applications: an electronic robot capable of on-demand deploying and wireless charging, a mechanical 8-3 encoder, a quadruped robot for cargo-release tasks, and a magneto-origami arts/craft. Our work contributes for the high-throughput fabrication of soft magneto-active machines with multi-functionalities.","Machines capable of magnetically controllable shape morphing and locomotion have diverse promising applications.

1309,Stomatin modulates adipogenesis through the ERK pathway and regulates fatty acid uptake and lipid droplet growth,"Regulation of fatty acid uptake, lipid production and storage, and metabolism of lipid droplets (LDs), is closely related to lipid homeostasis, adipocyte hypertrophy and obesity. We report here that stomatin, a major constituent of lipid raft, participates in adipogenesis and adipocyte maturation by modulating related signaling pathways. In adipocyte-like cells, increased stomatin promotes LD growth or enlargements by facilitating LD-LD fusion. It also promotes fatty acid uptake from extracellular environment by recruiting effector molecules, such as FAT/CD36 translocase, to lipid rafts to promote internalization of fatty acids. Stomatin transgenic mice fed with high-fat diet exhibit obesity, insulin resistance and hepatic impairments; however, such phenotypes are not seen in transgenic animals fed with regular diet. Inhibitions of stomatin by gene knockdown or OB-1 inhibit adipogenic differentiation and LD growth through downregulation of PPARγ pathway. Effects of stomatin on PPARγ involves ERK signaling; however, an alternate pathway may also exist.","Stomatin is a component of lipid rafts. Here, Wu et al. show that stomatin modulates the differentiation and functions of adipocytes by regulating adipogenesis signaling and fatty acid influx such that with excessive calorie intake, increased stomatin induces adiposity.",2022-07-19
1310,Rational design of a topological polymeric solid electrolyte for high-performance all-solid-state alkali metal batteries,"Poly(ethylene oxide)-based solid-state electrolytes are widely considered promising candidates for the next generation of lithium and sodium metal batteries. However, several challenges, including low oxidation resistance and low cation transference number, hinder poly(ethylene oxide)-based electrolytes for broad applications. To circumvent these issues, here, we propose the design, synthesis and application of a fluoropolymer, i.e., poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate). This polymer, when introduced into a poly(ethylene oxide)-based solid electrolyte, improves the electrochemical window stability and transference number. Via multiple physicochemical and theoretical characterizations, we identify the presence of tailored supramolecular bonds and peculiar morphological structures as the main factors responsible for the improved electrochemical performances. The polymeric solid electrolyte is also investigated in full lithium and sodium metal lab-scale cells. Interestingly, when tested in a single-layer pouch cell configuration in combination with a Li metal negative electrode and a LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4-based positive electrode, the polymeric solid-state electrolyte enables 200 cycles at 42 mA·g−1 and 70 °C with a stable discharge capacity of approximately 2.5 mAh when an external pressure of 0.28 MPa is applied.","Solid-state polymer electrolytes are crucial for developing future rechargeable batteries, but they are still limited in performance.

1311,Palladium catalyzed radical relay for the oxidative cross-coupling of quinolines,"Traditional approaches for transition-metal catalyzed oxidative cross-coupling reactions rely on sp2-hybridized starting materials, such as aryl halides, and more specifically, homogeneous catalysts. We report a heterogeneous Pd-catalyzed radical relay method for the conversion of a heteroarene C(sp3)–H bond into ethers. Pd nanoparticles are supported on an ordered mesoporous composite which, when compared with microporous activated carbons, greatly increases the Pd d charge because of their strong interaction with N-doped anatase nanocrystals. Mechanistic studies provide evidence that electron-deficient Pd with Pd–O/N coordinations efficiently catalyzes the radical relay reaction to release diffusible methoxyl radicals, and highlight the difference between this surface reaction and C–H oxidation mediated by homogeneous catalysts that operate with cyclopalladated intermediates. The reactions proceed efficiently with a turn-over frequency of 84 h−1 and high selectivity toward ethers of >99%. Negligible Pd leaching and activity loss are observed after 7 catalytic runs.",Traditional approaches for transition-metal catalyzed oxidative cross-coupling reactions rely on sp2-hybridized starting materials.

1312,Increased neutralization and IgG epitope identification after MVA-MERS-S booster vaccination against Middle East respiratory syndrome,"Vaccine development is essential for pandemic preparedness. We previously conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial of the vector vaccine candidate MVA-MERS-S against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), expressing its full spike glycoprotein (MERS-CoV-S), as a homologous two-dose regimen (Days 0 and 28). Here, we evaluate the safety (primary objective) and immunogenicity (secondary and exploratory objectives: magnitude and characterization of vaccine-induced humoral responses) of a third vaccination with MVA-MERS-S in a subgroup of trial participants one year after primary immunization. MVA-MERS-S booster vaccination is safe and well-tolerated. Both binding and neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV antibody titers increase substantially in all participants and exceed maximum titers observed after primary immunization more than 10-fold. We identify four immunogenic IgG epitopes, located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD, n = 1) and the S2 subunit (n = 3) of MERS-CoV-S. The level of baseline anti-human coronavirus antibody titers does not impact the generation of anti-MERS-CoV antibody responses. Our data support the rationale of a booster vaccination with MVA-MERS-S and encourage further investigation in larger trials. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03615911.","In a clinical trial, Fathi et al. show that a booster vaccination with a vector vaccine candidate against the highly pathogenic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus is safe and strongly improves the immunity generated by primary immunization.",2022-07-19
1313,Early Cambrian renewal of the geodynamo and the origin of inner core structure,"Paleomagnetism can elucidate the origin of inner core structure by establishing when crystallization started. The salient signal is an ultralow field strength, associated with waning thermal energy to power the geodynamo from core-mantle heat flux, followed by a sharp intensity increase as new thermal and compositional sources of buoyancy become available once inner core nucleation (ICN) commences. Ultralow fields have been reported from Ediacaran (~565 Ma) rocks, but the transition to stronger strengths has been unclear. Herein, we present single crystal paleointensity results from early Cambrian (~532 Ma) anorthosites of Oklahoma. These yield a time-averaged dipole moment 5 times greater than that of the Ediacaran Period. This rapid renewal of the field, together with data defining ultralow strengths, constrains ICN to ~550 Ma. Thermal modeling using this onset age suggests the inner core had grown to 50% of its current radius, where seismic anisotropy changes, by ~450 Ma. We propose the seismic anisotropy of the outermost inner core reflects development of a global spherical harmonic degree-2 deep mantle structure at this time that has persisted to the present day. The imprint of an older degree-1 pattern is preserved in the innermost inner core.",New single crystal paleointensity data show that the geomagnetic field was renewed in the early Cambrian after near collapse in the Ediacaran Period. This implies that the innermost/outermost structure of the inner core formed 450 million yrs. ago.,2022-07-19
1314,Multiple valence bands convergence and strong phonon scattering lead to high thermoelectric performance in p-type PbSe,"Thermoelectric generators enable the conversion of waste heat to electricity, which is an effective way to alleviate the global energy crisis. However, the inefficiency of thermoelectric materials is the main obstacle for realizing their widespread applications and thus developing materials with high thermoelectric performance is urgent. Here we show that multiple valence bands and strong phonon scattering can be realized simultaneously in p-type PbSe through the incorporation of AgInSe2. The multiple valleys enable large weighted mobility, indicating enhanced electrical properties. Abundant nano-scale precipitates and dislocations result in strong phonon scattering and thus ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. Consequently, we achieve an exceptional ZT of ~ 1.9 at 873 K in p-type PbSe. This work demonstrates that a combination of band manipulation and microstructure engineering can be realized by tuning the composition, which is expected to be a general strategy for improving the thermoelectric performance in bulk materials.","Power generation from heat to electricity can be realized by thermoelectric materials. Here, the authors improve the thermoelectric properties in PbSe enabled by multiple bands convergence and strong phonon scattering.",2022-07-19
1315,Drought-Induced Civil Conflict Among the Ancient Maya,"The influence of climate change on civil conflict and societal instability in the premodern world is a subject of much debate, in part because of the limited temporal or disciplinary scope of case studies. We present a transdisciplinary case study that combines archeological, historical, and paleoclimate datasets to explore the dynamic, shifting relationships among climate change, civil conflict, and political collapse at Mayapan, the largest Postclassic Maya capital of the Yucatán Peninsula in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries CE. Multiple data sources indicate that civil conflict increased significantly and generalized linear modeling correlates strife in the city with drought conditions between 1400 and 1450 cal. CE. We argue that prolonged drought escalated rival factional tensions, but subsequent adaptations reveal regional-scale resiliency, ensuring that Maya political and economic structures endured until European contact in the early sixteenth century CE.","The influence of climate on premodern civil conflict and societal instability is debated. Here, the authors combine archeological, historical, and paleoclimatic datasets to show that drought between 1400-1450 cal.

1316,Genomic insights into the secondary aquatic transition of penguins,"Penguins lost the ability to fly more than 60 million years ago, subsequently evolving a hyper-specialized marine body plan. Within the framework of a genome-scale, fossil-inclusive phylogeny, we identify key geological events that shaped penguin diversification and genomic signatures consistent with widespread refugia/recolonization during major climate oscillations. We further identify a suite of genes potentially underpinning adaptations related to thermoregulation, oxygenation, diving, vision, diet, immunity and body size, which might have facilitated their remarkable secondary transition to an aquatic ecology. Our analyses indicate that penguins and their sister group (Procellariiformes) have the lowest evolutionary rates yet detected in birds. Together, these findings help improve our understanding of how penguins have transitioned to the marine environment, successfully colonizing some of the most extreme environments on Earth.","This study examines the tempo and drivers of penguin diversification by combining genomes from all extant and recently extinct penguin lineages, stratigraphic data from fossil penguins and morphological and biogeographic data from all extant and extinct species.

1317,Reactivity-dependent profiling of RNA 5-methylcytidine dioxygenases,"Epitranscriptomic RNA modifications can regulate fundamental biological processes, but we lack approaches to map modification sites and probe writer enzymes. Here we present a chemoproteomic strategy to characterize RNA 5-methylcytidine (m5C) dioxygenase enzymes in their native context based upon metabolic labeling and activity-based crosslinking with 5-ethynylcytidine (5-EC). We profile m5C dioxygenases in human cells including ALKBH1 and TET2 and show that ALKBH1 is the major hm5C- and f5C-forming enzyme in RNA. Further, we map ALKBH1 modification sites transcriptome-wide using 5-EC-iCLIP and ARP-based sequencing to identify ALKBH1-dependent m5C oxidation in a variety of tRNAs and mRNAs and analyze ALKBH1 substrate specificity in vitro. We also apply targeted pyridine borane-mediated sequencing to measure f5C sites on select tRNA. Finally, we show that f5C at the wobble position of tRNA-Leu-CAA plays a role in decoding Leu codons under stress. Our work provides powerful chemical approaches for studying RNA m5C dioxygenases and mapping oxidative m5C modifications and reveals the existence of novel epitranscriptomic pathways for regulating RNA function.",Kleiner and co-workers profile RNA 5-methylcytidine (m5C) dioxygenase enzymes using an activity-based metabolic probing strategy.

1318,Duration of protection of CoronaVac plus heterologous BNT162b2 booster in the Omicron period in Brazil,"To date, no information has been published on the effectiveness of inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccines plus heterologous booster against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death) during the dominance of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant period. We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of CoronaVac plus BNT162b2 booster during the period of dominance of the Omicron variant in Brazil (January to April 2022). Using a test-negative design, we analysed data for 2,471,576 individuals tested during the Omicron variant’s dominant period using a nationally linked database from Brazil. Compared to unvaccinated, vaccinees maintained protection against severe outcomes, with an estimated VE of 84.1% (95% CI:83.2–84.9) at more than 120 days after BNT162b2 booster. Furthermore, while we detected a high level of protection against severe outcomes for individuals up to 79 years old, waning was observed for individuals aged ≥80 years, with VE decreasing from 81.3% (95% CI:77.9–84.2) at 31–60 days to 72.9% (95% CI:70.6–75.1) at 120 days or more after the booster dose. However, no significant protection against symptomatic infection was observed at this time period. In conclusion, except for individuals aged ≥80 years, CoronaVac plus a BNT162b2 booster dose offered high and durable protection against severe outcomes due to Omicron.","Primary CoronaVac vaccination followed by a BNT162b2 booster dose confers protection against some SARS-CoV-2 variants but its effectiveness against Omicron is unknown. Here, the authors show that this combination confers a high level of protection against severe outcomes for up to 120 days, with evidence of waning for those aged 80 or older.",2022-07-18
1319,In situ atomic-scale observation of dislocation climb and grain boundary evolution in nanostructured metal,"Non-conservative dislocation climb plays a unique role in the plastic deformation and creep of crystalline materials. Nevertheless, the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms of dislocation climb have not been explored by direct experimental observations. Here, we report atomic-scale observations of grain boundary (GB) dislocation climb in nanostructured Au during in situ straining at room temperature. The climb of a edge dislocation is found to occur by stress-induced reconstruction of two neighboring atomic columns at the edge of an extra half atomic plane in the dislocation core. This is different from the conventional belief of dislocation climb by destruction or construction of a single atomic column at the dislocation core. The atomic route of the dislocation climb we proposed is demonstrated to be energetically favorable by Monte Carlo simulations. Our in situ observations also reveal GB evolution through dislocation climb at room temperature, which suggests a means of controlling microstructures and properties of nanostructured metals.","Dislocation climb is crucial to plasticity and creep of materials. Here, the authors report real-time atomic-scale observations of grain boundary dislocation climb in nanostructured Au at room temperature. The dislocation climb occurs by reconstruction of two atomic columns in the dislocation core.",2022-07-18
1320,Bioinspired asymmetric amphiphilic surface for triboelectric enhanced efficient water harvesting,"The effective acquisition of clean water from atmospheric water offers a potential sustainable solution for increasing global water and energy shortages. In this study, an asymmetric amphiphilic surface incorporating self-driven triboelectric adsorption was developed to obtain clean water from the atmosphere. Inspired by cactus spines and beetle elytra, the asymmetric amphiphilic surface was constructed by synthesizing amphiphilic cellulose ester coatings followed by coating on laser-engraved spines of fluorinated ethylene propylene. Notably, the spontaneous interfacial triboelectric charge between the droplet and the collector was exploited for electrostatic adsorption. Additionally, the droplet triboelectric nanogenerator converts the mechanical energy generated by droplets falling into electrical energy through the volume effect, achieving an excellent output performance, and further enhancing the electrostatic adsorption by means of external charges, which achieved a water harvesting efficiency of 93.18 kg/m2 h. This strategy provides insights for the design of water harvesting system.","The effective acquisition of clean water from atmospheric water offers a potential sustainable solution for increasing global water shortages.

1321,Immune responses in Omicron SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection in vaccinated adults,"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has more than 15 mutations in the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein enabling increased transmissibility and viral escape from antibodies in vaccinated individuals. It is unclear how vaccine immunity protects against Omicron infection. Here we show that vaccinated participants at a super-spreader event have robust recall response of humoral and pre-existing cellular immunity induced by the vaccines, and an emergent de novo T cell response to non-Spike antigens. Individuals with Omicron SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections have significantly increased activated SARS-CoV-2 wild type Spike-specific cytotoxic T cells, activated follicular helper (TFH) cells, functional T cell responses, boosted humoral responses, and rapid release of Spike and RBD-specific IgG+ B cell plasmablasts and memory B cells into circulation. Omicron breakthrough infection affords significantly increased de novo memory T cell responses to non-Spike viral antigens. Concerted T and B cell responses may provide durable and broad immunity.","The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant possess many mutations within the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein, which confer increased transmissibility and higher antibody escape.

1322,People infer communicative action through an expectation for efficient communication,"Humans often communicate using body movements like winks, waves, and nods. However, it is unclear how we identify when someone’s physical actions are communicative. Given people’s propensity to interpret each other’s behavior as aimed to produce changes in the world, we hypothesize that people expect communicative actions to efficiently reveal that they lack an external goal. Using computational models of goal inference, we predict that movements that are unlikely to be produced when acting towards the world and, in particular, repetitive ought to be seen as communicative. We find support for our account across a variety of paradigms, including graded acceptability tasks, forced-choice tasks, indirect prompts, and open-ended explanation tasks, in both market-integrated and non-market-integrated communities. Our work shows that the recognition of communicative action is grounded in an inferential process that stems from fundamental computations shared across different forms of action interpretation.","Humans can quickly infer when someone’s body movements are meant to be communicative. Here, the authors show that this capacity is underpinned by an expectation that communicative actions will efficiently reveal that they lack an external goal.",2022-07-18
1323,Structural basis for the activation and ligand recognition of the human oxytocin receptor,"The small cyclic neuropeptide hormone oxytocin (OT) and its cognate receptor play a central role in the regulation of social behaviour and sexual reproduction. Here we report the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of the active oxytocin receptor (OTR) in complex with its cognate ligand oxytocin. Our structure provides high-resolution insights into the OT binding mode, the OTR activation mechanism as well as the subtype specificity within the oxytocin/vasopressin receptor family.","Here, Waltenspühl et al. report the cryo-EM structure of active human oxytocin receptor in complex with oxytocin and with a heterotrimeric G protein, providing insights into this hormone system critically involved in the regulation of social behaviour and reproduction.",2022-07-18
1324,Low-defect-density WS2 by hydroxide vapor phase deposition,"Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting monolayers such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising channel materials to extend Moore’s Law in advanced electronics. Synthetic TMD layers from chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are scalable for fabrication but notorious for their high defect densities. Therefore, innovative endeavors on growth reaction to enhance their quality are urgently needed. Here, we report that the hydroxide W species, an extremely pure vapor phase metal precursor form, is very efficient for sulfurization, leading to about one order of magnitude lower defect density compared to those from conventional CVD methods. The field-effect transistor (FET) devices based on the proposed growth reach a peak electron mobility ~200 cm2/Vs (~800 cm2/Vs) at room temperature (15 K), comparable to those from exfoliated flakes. The FET device with a channel length of 100 nm displays a high on-state current of ~400 µA/µm, encouraging the industrialization of 2D materials.","Chemical vapor deposition enables the scalable production of 2D semiconductors, but the grown materials are usually affected by high defect densities. Here, the authors report a hydroxide vapour phase deposition method to synthesize wafer-scale monolayer WS2 with reduced defect density and electrical properties comparable to those of exfoliated flakes.",2022-07-18
1325,Orexin neurons inhibit sleep to promote arousal,"Humans and animals lacking orexin neurons exhibit daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks, and state instability. While the circuit basis by which orexin neurons contribute to consolidated wakefulness remains unclear, existing models posit that orexin neurons provide their wake-stabilizing influence by exerting excitatory tone on other brain arousal nodes. Here we show using in vivo optogenetics, in vitro optogenetic-based circuit mapping, and single-cell transcriptomics that orexin neurons also contribute to arousal maintenance through indirect inhibition of sleep-promoting neurons of the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. Activation of this subcortical circuit rapidly drives wakefulness from sleep by differentially modulating the activity of ventrolateral preoptic neurons. We further identify and characterize a feedforward circuit through which orexin (and co-released glutamate) acts to indirectly target and inhibit sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic neurons to produce arousal. This revealed circuitry provides an alternate framework for understanding how orexin neurons contribute to the maintenance of consolidated wakefulness and stabilize behavioral state.","Sleep and wakefulness is stabilized by a population of orexin-expressing neurons. In this study, the authors demonstrate how these neurons drive arousal by silencing sleep-promoting neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus.",2022-07-18
1326,Actuating compact wearable augmented reality devices by multifunctional artificial muscle,"An artificial muscle actuator resolves practical engineering problems in compact wearable devices, which are limited to conventional actuators such as electromagnetic actuators. Abstracting the fundamental advantages of an artificial muscle actuator provides a small-scale, high-power actuating system with a sensing capability for developing varifocal augmented reality glasses and naturally fit haptic gloves. Here, we design a shape memory alloy-based lightweight and high-power artificial muscle actuator, the so-called compliant amplified shape memory alloy actuator. Despite its light weight (0.22 g), the actuator has a high power density of 1.7 kW/kg, an actuation strain of 300% under 80 g of external payload. We show how the actuator enables image depth control and an immersive tactile response in the form of augmented reality glasses and two-way communication haptic gloves whose thin form factor and high power density can hardly be achieved by conventional actuators.","Artificial muscle actuators enabled by responsive functional materials like shape memory alloys are promising candidates for compact e-wearable devices. Here, authors demonstrate augmented reality glasses and two-way communication haptic gloves capable of image depth control and immersive tactile response.",2022-07-18
1327,Proteomic analysis reveals key differences between squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas across multiple tissues,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC) are two main histological subtypes of solid cancer; however, SCCs are derived from different organs with similar morphologies, and it is challenging to distinguish the origin of metastatic SCCs. Here we report a deep proteomic analysis of 333 SCCs of 17 organs and 69 ACs of 7 organs. Proteomic comparison between SCCs and ACs identifies distinguishable pivotal pathways and molecules in those pathways play consistent adverse or opposite prognostic roles in ACs and SCCs. A comparison between common and rare SCCs highlights lipid metabolism may reinforce the malignancy of rare SCCs. Proteomic clusters reveal anatomical features, and kinase-transcription factor networks indicate differential SCC characteristics, while immune subtyping reveals diverse tumor microenvironments across and within diagnoses and identified potential druggable targets. Furthermore, tumor-specific proteins provide candidates with differentially diagnostic values. This proteomics architecture represents a public resource for researchers seeking a better understanding of SCCs and ACs.","Squamous cell carcinomas are an aggressive cancer type which can occur in multiple organ systems. Here, the authors analyse the proteome of SCC cancers from 17 organs and show commonly dysregulated proteins independent of location.",2022-07-18
1328,Efficient use of cement and concrete to reduce reliance on supply-side technologies for net-zero emissions,"Decarbonization strategies for the cement and concrete sector have relied heavily on supply-side technologies, including carbon capture and storage (CCS), masking opportunities for demand-side intervention. Here we show that cross-cutting strategies involving both the supply and demand sides can achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across the entire Japanese cement and concrete cycle without resorting to mass deployment of CCS. Our analysis shows that a series of mitigation efforts on the supply side can reduce 2050 CO2 emissions by up to 80% from baseline levels and that the remaining 20% mitigation gap can be fully bridged by the efficient use of cement and concrete in the built environment. However, this decarbonization pathway is dependent on how CO2 uptake by carbonation and carbon capture and utilization is accounted for in the inventory. Our analysis underscores the importance of including demand-side interventions at the heart of decarbonization strategies and highlights the urgent need to discuss how to account for CO2 uptake in national inventories under the Paris Agreement.","A new study finds supply-side efforts alone are unlikely to lead to net-zero emissions across the cement and concrete cycle by 2050, advocating for more efficient use of cement and concrete in the built environment and more strategic options for decarbonization.",2022-07-18
1329,Pinhole-seeded lateral epitaxy and exfoliation of GaSb films on graphene-terminated surfaces,"Remote epitaxy is a promising approach for synthesizing exfoliatable crystalline membranes and enabling epitaxy of materials with large lattice mismatch. However, the atomic scale mechanisms for remote epitaxy remain unclear. Here we experimentally demonstrate that GaSb films grow on graphene-terminated GaSb (001) via a seeded lateral epitaxy mechanism, in which pinhole defects in the graphene serve as selective nucleation sites, followed by lateral epitaxy and coalescence into a continuous film. Remote interactions are not necessary in order to explain the growth. Importantly, the small size of the pinholes permits exfoliation of continuous, free-standing GaSb membranes. Due to the chemical similarity between GaSb and other III-V materials, we anticipate this mechanism to apply more generally to other materials. By combining molecular beam epitaxy with in-situ electron diffraction and photoemission, plus ex-situ atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we track the graphene defect generation and GaSb growth evolution a few monolayers at a time. Our results show that the controlled introduction of nanoscale openings in graphene provides an alternative route towards tuning the growth and properties of 3D epitaxial films and membranes on 2D material masks.","Remote epitaxy represents a promising method for the synthesis of thin films on lattice-mismatched substrates, but its atomic-scale mechanisms are still unclear. Here, the authors demonstrate the growth of exfoliatable GaSb films on graphene-terminated GaSb (001) via seeded lateral epitaxy, showing that pinhole defects in graphene serve as selective nucleation sites.",2022-07-18
1330,N6-methyladenosine modification-mediated mRNA metabolism is essential for human pancreatic lineage specification and islet organogenesis,"Pancreatic differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provides promising avenues for investigating development and treating diseases. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal messenger RNA (mRNA) modification and plays pivotal roles in regulation of mRNA metabolism, while its functions remain elusive. Here, we profile the dynamic landscapes of m6A transcriptome-wide during pancreatic differentiation. Next, we generate knockout hPSC lines of the major m6A demethylase ALKBH5, and find that ALKBH5 plays significant regulatory roles in pancreatic organogenesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that ALKBH5 deficiency reduces the mRNA stability of key pancreatic transcription factors in an m6A and YTHDF2-dependent manner. We further identify that ALKBH5 cofactor α-ketoglutarate can be applied to enhance differentiation. Collectively, our findings identify ALKBH5 as an essential regulator of pancreatic differentiation and highlight that m6A modification-mediated mRNA metabolism presents an important layer of regulation during cell-fate specification and holds great potentials for translational applications.","Ma et al. profile the dynamic landscape of m6A during pancreatic differentiation, and identify ALKBH5 as an essential m6A regulator supporting pancreatic differentiation, indicating a role for m6A-mediated mRNA metabolism in cell-fate specification.",2022-07-18
1331,Spongy all-in-liquid materials by in-situ formation of emulsions at oil-water interfaces,"Printing a structured network of functionalized droplets in a liquid medium enables engineering collectives of living cells for functional purposes and promises enormous applications in processes ranging from energy storage to tissue engineering. Current approaches are limited to drop-by-drop printing or face limitations in reproducing the sophisticated internal features of a structured material and its interactions with the surrounding media. Here, we report a simple approach for creating stable liquid filaments of silica nanoparticle dispersions and use them as inks to print all-in-liquid materials that consist of a network of droplets. Silica nanoparticles stabilize liquid filaments at Weber numbers two orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported in liquid-liquid systems by rapidly producing a concentrated emulsion zone at the oil-water interface. We experimentally demonstrate the printed aqueous phase is emulsified in-situ; consequently, a 3D structure is achieved with flexible walls consisting of layered emulsions. The tube-like printed features have a spongy texture resembling miniaturized versions of “tube sponges” found in the oceans. A scaling analysis based on the interplay between hydrodynamics and emulsification kinetics reveals that filaments are formed when emulsions are generated and remain at the interface during the printing period. Stabilized filaments are utilized for printing liquid-based fluidic channels.","All-in-liquid printing promises applications from energy storage to drug delivery and tissue engineering. Here, authors present the in-situ generation of layered emulsion in a fraction of a second at the oil-water interface forming 3D tube-like structures in a liquid medium.",2022-07-18
1332,Periosteal stem cells control growth plate stem cells during postnatal skeletal growth,"The ontogeny and fate of stem cells have been extensively investigated by lineage-tracing approaches. At distinct anatomical sites, bone tissue harbors multiple types of skeletal stem cells, which may independently supply osteogenic cells in a site-specific manner. Periosteal stem cells (PSCs) and growth plate resting zone stem cells (RZSCs) critically contribute to intramembranous and endochondral bone formation, respectively. However, it remains unclear whether there is functional crosstalk between these two types of skeletal stem cells. Here we show PSCs are not only required for intramembranous bone formation, but also for the growth plate maintenance and prolonged longitudinal bone growth. Mice deficient in PSCs display progressive defects in intramembranous and endochondral bone formation, the latter of which is caused by a deficiency in PSC-derived Indian hedgehog (Ihh). PSC-specific deletion of Ihh impairs the maintenance of the RZSCs, leading to a severe defect in endochondral bone formation in postnatal life. Thus, crosstalk between periosteal and growth plate stem cells is essential for post-developmental skeletal growth.","Intramembranous and endochondral bone formation have been considered to be independent processes mediated by independent stem cells. Here the authors show that periosteal stem cells participate in both types of bone formation, supporting endochondral formation by producing Ihh.",2022-07-18
1333,Milli-scale cellular robots that can reconfigure morphologies and behaviors simultaneously,"Modular robot that can reconfigure architectures and functions has advantages in unpredicted environment and task. However, the construction of modular robot at small-scale remains a challenge since the lack of reliable docking and detaching strategies. Here we report the concept of milli-scale cellular robot (mCEBOT) achieved by the heterogeneous assembly of two types of units (short and long units). Under the magnetic field, the proposed mCEBOT units can not only selectively assemble (e.g., end-by-end and side-by-side) into diverse morphologies corresponding to the unstructured environments, but also configure multi-modes motion behaviors (e.g., slipping, rolling, walking and climbing) based on the on-site task requirements. We demonstrate its adaptive mobility from narrow space to high barrier to wetting surface, and its potential applications in hanging target taking and environment exploration. The concept of mCEBOT offers new opportunities for robot design, and will broaden the field of modular robot in both miniaturization and functionalization.","Modular robots with reconfigurable architectures show advantages in unpredicted environments. Here Yang et al. propose a heterogeneous assembly concept for cellular robot construction at millimeter scales, which can simultaneously reconfigure their morphologies and behaviours to conduct versatile tasks on demand.",2022-07-18
1334,Hepatocyte growth factor derived from senescent cells attenuates cell competition-induced apical elimination of oncogenic cells,"Cellular senescence and cell competition are important tumor suppression mechanisms that restrain cells with oncogenic mutations at the initial stage of cancer development. However, the link between cellular senescence and cell competition remains unclear. Senescent cells accumulated during the in vivo aging process contribute toward age-related cancers via the development of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Here, we report that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a SASP factor, inhibits apical extrusion and promotes basal protrusion of Ras-mutated cells in the cell competition assay. Additionally, cellular senescence induced by a high-fat diet promotes the survival of cells with oncogenic mutations, whereas crizotinib, an inhibitor of HGF signaling, provokes the removal of mutated cells from mouse livers and intestines. Our study provides evidence that cellular senescence inhibits cell competition-mediated elimination of oncogenic cells through HGF signaling, suggesting that it may lead to cancer incidence during aging.",Ras mutations induce cell competition and cellular senescence to inhibit the proliferation of oncogenic mutated cells. Here the authors demonstrate that cellular senescence inhibits cell competition-induced elimination of oncogenic cells through HGF signalling.,2022-07-18
1335,Age-dependent changes in circulating Tfh cells influence development of functional malaria antibodies in children,"T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells are key drivers of antibodies that protect from malaria. However, little is known regarding the host and parasite factors that influence Tfh and functional antibody development. Here, we use samples from a large cross-sectional study of children residing in an area of high malaria transmission in Uganda to characterize Tfh cells and functional antibodies to multiple parasites stages. We identify a dramatic re-distribution of the Tfh cell compartment with age that is independent of malaria exposure, with Th2-Tfh cells predominating in early childhood, while Th1-Tfh cell gradually increase to adult levels over the first decade of life. Functional antibody acquisition is age-dependent and hierarchical acquired based on parasite stage, with merozoite responses followed by sporozoite and gametocyte antibodies. Antibodies are boosted in children with current infection, and are higher in females. The children with the very highest antibody levels have increased Tfh cell activation and proliferation, consistent with a key role of Tfh cells in antibody development. Together, these data reveal a complex relationship between the circulating Tfh compartment, antibody development and protection from malaria.","Despite being key drivers of protective antibodies against malaria, little is known regarding the host and parasite factors that influence CD4 T-follicular helper cell and antibody development. Authors utilise samples from a study of children living in an area of high malaria transmission in Uganda, to characterize Tfh cells and functional antibodies to multiple parasites stages.",2022-07-18
1336,Selective activation of Gαob by an adenosine A1 receptor agonist elicits analgesia without cardiorespiratory depression,"The development of therapeutic agonists for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is hampered by the propensity of GPCRs to couple to multiple intracellular signalling pathways. This promiscuous coupling leads to numerous downstream cellular effects, some of which are therapeutically undesirable. This is especially the case for adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs) whose clinical potential is undermined by the sedation and cardiorespiratory depression caused by conventional agonists. We have discovered that the A1R-selective agonist, benzyloxy-cyclopentyladenosine (BnOCPA), is a potent and powerful analgesic but does not cause sedation, bradycardia, hypotension or respiratory depression. This unprecedented discrimination between native A1Rs arises from BnOCPA’s unique and exquisitely selective activation of Gob among the six Gαi/o subtypes, and in the absence of β-arrestin recruitment. BnOCPA thus demonstrates a highly-specific Gα-selective activation of the native A1R, sheds new light on GPCR signalling, and reveals new possibilities for the development of novel therapeutics based on the far-reaching concept of selective Gα agonism.","Wall et al. describe the selective activation of an adenosine A1 receptor-mediated intracellular pathway that provides potent analgesia in the absence of sedation or cardiorespiratory depression, paving the way for novel medicines based on the far-reaching concept of selective Gα agonism.",2022-07-18
1337,Ritter-type amination of C(sp3)-H bonds enabled by electrochemistry with SO42−,"By merging electricity with sulfate, the Ritter-type amination of C(sp3)-H bonds is developed in an undivided cell under room temperature. This method features broad substrate generality (71 examples, up to 93% yields), high functional-group compatibility, facile scalability, excellent site-selectivity and mild conditions. Common alkanes and electron-deficient alkylbenzenes are viable substrates. It also provides a straightforward protocol for incorporating C-deuterated acetylamino group into C(sp3)-H sites. Application in the synthesis or modification of pharmaceuticals or their derivatives and gram-scale synthesis demonstrate the practicability of this method. Mechanistic experiments show that sulfate radical anion, formed by electrolysis of sulfate, served as hydrogen atom transfer agent to provide alkyl radical intermediate. This method paves a convenient and flexible pathway for realizing various synthetically useful transformations of C(sp3)-H bonds mediated by sulfate radical anion generated via electrochemistry.","The amination of C(sp3)–H bonds is an appealing and challenging task in organic synthesis. Here, by using an electrogenerated sulfate radical an HAT agent, the authors report a practical Ritter-type amination of C(sp3)–H bonds.",2022-07-16
1338,Efficient spatially targeted gene editing using a near-infrared activatable protein-conjugated nanoparticle for brain applications,"Spatial control of gene expression is critical to modulate cellular functions and deconstruct the function of individual genes in biological processes. Light-responsive gene-editing formulations have been recently developed; however, they have shown limited applicability in vivo due to poor tissue penetration, limited cellular transfection and the difficulty in evaluating the activity of the edited cells. Here, we report a formulation composed of upconversion nanoparticles conjugated with Cre recombinase enzyme through a photocleavable linker, and a lysosomotropic agent that facilitates endolysosomal escape. This formulation allows in vitro spatial control in gene editing after activation with near-infrared light. We further demonstrate the potential of this formulation in vivo through three different paradigms: (i) gene editing in neurogenic niches, (ii) gene editing in the ventral tegmental area to facilitate monitoring of edited cells by precise optogenetic control of reward and reinforcement, and (iii) gene editing in a localized brain region via a noninvasive administration route (i.e., intranasal).","Spatial control of gene expression allows precise control over biological processes. Here, the authors develop an efficient light-responsive formulation based on upconversion nanoparticles, and demonstrate on-demand genetic manipulation in deep brain tissue.",2022-07-16
1339,ZnT8 loss-of-function accelerates functional maturation of hESC-derived β cells and resists metabolic stress in diabetes,"Human embryonic stem cell-derived β cells (SC-β cells) hold great promise for treatment of diabetes, yet how to achieve functional maturation and protect them against metabolic stresses such as glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity remains elusive. Our single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals that ZnT8 loss of function (LOF) accelerates the functional maturation of SC-β cells. As a result, ZnT8 LOF improves glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by releasing the negative feedback of zinc inhibition on insulin secretion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ZnT8 LOF mutations endow SC-β cells with resistance to lipotoxicity/glucotoxicity-triggered cell death by alleviating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through modulation of zinc levels. Importantly, transplantation of SC-β cells with ZnT8 LOF into mice with preexisting diabetes significantly improves glycemia restoration and glucose tolerance. These findings highlight the beneficial effect of ZnT8 LOF on the functional maturation and survival of SC-β cells that are useful as a potential source for cell replacement therapies.","Immature function and fragility hinder application of hESC-derived β cells (SC-β cell) for diabetes cell therapy. Here, the authors identify ZnT8 as a gene editing target to enhance the insulin secretion and cell survival under metabolic stress by abolishing zinc transport in SC-β cells.",2022-07-16
1340,Compounds activating VCP D1 ATPase enhance both autophagic and proteasomal neurotoxic protein clearance,"Enhancing the removal of aggregate-prone toxic proteins is a rational therapeutic strategy for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Huntington’s disease and various spinocerebellar ataxias. Ideally, such approaches should preferentially clear the mutant/misfolded species, while having minimal impact on the stability of wild-type/normally-folded proteins. Furthermore, activation of both ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome routes may be advantageous, as this would allow effective clearance of both monomeric and oligomeric species, the latter which are inaccessible to the proteasome. Here we find that compounds that activate the D1 ATPase activity of VCP/p97 fulfill these requirements. Such effects are seen with small molecule VCP activators like SMER28, which activate autophagosome biogenesis by enhancing interactions of PI3K complex components to increase PI(3)P production, and also accelerate VCP-dependent proteasomal clearance of such substrates. Thus, this mode of VCP activation may be a very attractive target for many neurodegenerative diseases.","Several neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the aggregation of cytoplasmic proteins. Here, the authors demonstrate that the small molecule SMER28 activates VCP, which enhances both autophagic and proteasomal clearance of aggregate-prone proteins.",2022-07-16
1341,Realizing quantum convolutional neural networks on a superconducting quantum processor to recognize quantum phases,"Quantum computing crucially relies on the ability to efficiently characterize the quantum states output by quantum hardware. Conventional methods which probe these states through direct measurements and classically computed correlations become computationally expensive when increasing the system size. Quantum neural networks tailored to recognize specific features of quantum states by combining unitary operations, measurements and feedforward promise to require fewer measurements and to tolerate errors. Here, we realize a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) on a 7-qubit superconducting quantum processor to identify symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of a spin model characterized by a non-zero string order parameter. We benchmark the performance of the QCNN based on approximate ground states of a family of cluster-Ising Hamiltonians which we prepare using a hardware-efficient, low-depth state preparation circuit. We find that, despite being composed of finite-fidelity gates itself, the QCNN recognizes the topological phase with higher fidelity than direct measurements of the string order parameter for the prepared states.","Quantum neural networks could help analysing the output of quantum computers and quantum simulators of growing complexity. Here, the authors use a 7-qubit superconducting quantum processor to show how a quantum convolutional neural network can correctly recognise the phase of a quantum many-body state.",2022-07-16
1342,The CIP2A-TOPBP1 complex safeguards chromosomal stability during mitosis,"The accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), highly toxic DNA lesions, is crucial for genome integrity and is tightly regulated during the cell cycle. In mitosis, cells inactivate DSB repair in favor of a tethering mechanism that stabilizes broken chromosomes until they are repaired in the subsequent cell cycle phases. How this is achieved mechanistically is not yet understood, but the adaptor protein TOPBP1 is critically implicated in this process. Here, we identify CIP2A as a TOPBP1-interacting protein that regulates TOPBP1 localization specifically in mitosis. Cells lacking CIP2A display increased radio-sensitivity, micronuclei formation and chromosomal instability. CIP2A is actively exported from the cell nucleus in interphase but, upon nuclear envelope breakdown at the onset of mitosis, gains access to chromatin where it forms a complex with MDC1 and TOPBP1 to promote TOPBP1 recruitment to sites of mitotic DSBs. Collectively, our data uncover CIP2A-TOPBP1 as a mitosis-specific genome maintenance complex.","In this work, CIP2A is discovered as a TOPBP1-interacting protein that regulates TOPBP1 localization specifically in mitosis. Cells lacking CIP2A display increased radio-sensitivity, micronuclei formation and chromosomal instability.",2022-07-16
1343,Super-broadband on-chip continuous spectral translation unlocking coherent optical communications beyond conventional telecom bands,"Today’s optical communication systems are fast approaching their capacity limits in the conventional telecom bands. Opening up new wavelength bands is becoming an appealing solution to the capacity crunch. However, this ordinarily requires the development of optical transceivers for any new wavelength band, which is time-consuming and expensive. Here, we present an on-chip continuous spectral translation method that leverages existing commercial transceivers to unlock the vast and currently unused potential new wavelength bands. The spectral translators are continuous-wave laser pumped aluminum gallium arsenide on insulator (AlGaAsOI) nanowaveguides that provide a continuous conversion bandwidth over an octave. We demonstrate coherent transmission in the 2-μm band using well-developed conventional C-band transmitters and coherent receivers, as an example of the potential of the spectral translators that could also unlock communications at other wavelength bands. We demonstrate 318.25-Gbit s−1 Nyquist wavelength-division multiplexed coherent transmission over a 1.15-km hollow-core fibre using this approach. Our demonstration paves the way for transmitting, detecting, and processing signals at wavelength bands beyond the capability of today’s devices.","Continuous spectral translation could allow expansion of the bandwidth available for communication without having to develop transceivers for the new bands. Here, the authors demonstrate this using AlGaAsOI nanowaveguides as spectral translators between the mature telecom C band and the 2-μm wavelength band.",2022-07-16
1344,NHC-Ni(II)-catalyzed cyclopropene-isocyanide [5 + 1] benzannulation,"Isocyanides are common compounds in fine and bulk chemical syntheses. However, the direct addition of isocyanide to simple unactivated cyclopropene via transition metal catalysis is challenging. Most of the current approaches focus on 1,1-insertion of isocyanide to M-R or nucleophilc insertion. That is often complicated by the competitive homo-oligomerization reactivity occurring at room temperature, such as isocyanide 1,1-insertion by Ni(II). Here we show a (N-heterocyclic carbene)Ni(II) catalyst that enables cyclopropene-isocyanide [5 + 1] benzannulation. As shown in the broad substrate scope and a [trans-(N-heterocyclic carbene)Ni(isocyanide)Br2] crystal structure, the desired cross-reactivity is cooperatively controlled by the high reactivity of the cyclopropene, the sterically bulky N-heterocyclic carbene, and the strong coordination ability of the isocyanide. This direct addition strategy offers aromatic amine derivatives and complements the Dötz benzannulation and Semmelhack/Wulff 1,4-hydroquinone synthesis. Several sterically bulky, fused, and multi-substituted anilines and unsymmetric functionalized spiro-ring structures are prepared from those easily accessible starting materials expediently.","The direct addition of isocyanides to cyclopropenes is challenging. Here, the authors report a catalytic cyclopropene-isocyanide [5 + 1] benzannulation catalyzed by an (N-heterocyclic carbene)Ni(II) complex; this method enables the preparation of fused and multi-substituted anilines and unsymmetrically functionalized spiro-ring structures.",2022-07-16
1345,Quantum trajectory framework for general time-local master equations,"Master equations are one of the main avenues to study open quantum systems. When the master equation is of the Lindblad–Gorini–Kossakowski–Sudarshan form, its solution can be “unraveled in quantum trajectories” i.e., represented as an average over the realizations of a Markov process in the Hilbert space of the system. Quantum trajectories of this type are both an element of quantum measurement theory as well as a numerical tool for systems in large Hilbert spaces. We prove that general time-local and trace-preserving master equations also admit an unraveling in terms of a Markov process in the Hilbert space of the system. The crucial ingredient is to weigh averages by a probability pseudo-measure which we call the “influence martingale”. The influence martingale satisfies a 1d stochastic differential equation enslaved to the ones governing the quantum trajectories. We thus extend the existing theory without increasing the computational complexity.","Quantum trajectory frameworks describe systems weakly coupled to their environment. Here, by including an extra 1D variable in the dynamics, the authors introduce a quantum trajectory framework for time local master equations derived at strong coupling while keeping the computational complexity under control.",2022-07-16
1346,Nanoparticle elasticity affects systemic circulation lifetime by modulating adsorption of apolipoprotein A-I in corona formation,"Nanoparticle elasticity is crucial in nanoparticles’ physiological fate, but how this occurs is largely unknown. Using core-shell nanoparticles with a same PEGylated lipid bilayer shell yet cores differing in elasticity (45 kPa – 760 MPa) as models, we isolate the effects of nanoparticle elasticity from those of other physiochemical parameters and, using mouse models, observe a non-monotonic relationship of systemic circulation lifetime versus nanoparticle elasticity. Incubating our nanoparticles in mouse plasma provides protein coronas varying non-monotonically in composition depending on nanoparticle elasticity. Particularly, apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA1) is the only protein whose relative abundance in corona strongly correlates with our nanoparticles’ blood clearance lifetime. Notably, similar results are observed when above nanoparticles’ PEGylated lipid bilayer shell is changed to be non-PEGylated. This work unveils the mechanisms by which nanoparticle elasticity affects nanoparticles’ physiological fate and suggests nanoparticle elasticity as a readily tunable parameter in future rational exploiting of protein corona.","Nanoparticle elasticity is known to affect physiological fate but how this occurs is largely unknown. Here, the authors report on a study using nanoparticles differing in elasticity alone to show a difference in the protein corona, in particular apolipoprotein A-1 absorption, corresponds to differences in circulation time.",2022-07-16
1347,Lysosomal protein transmembrane 5 promotes lung-specific metastasis by regulating BMPR1A lysosomal degradation,"Organotropism during cancer metastasis occurs frequently but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that lysosomal protein transmembrane 5 (LAPTM5) promotes lung-specific metastasis in renal cancer. LAPTM5 sustains self-renewal and cancer stem cell-like traits of renal cancer cells by blocking the function of lung-derived bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Mechanistic investigations showed that LAPTM5 recruits WWP2, which binds to the BMP receptor BMPR1A and mediates its lysosomal sorting, ubiquitination and ultimate degradation. BMPR1A expression was restored by the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine. LAPTM5 expression could also serve as an independent predictor of lung metastasis in renal cancer. Lastly, elevation of LAPTM5 expression in lung metastases is a common phenomenon in multiple cancer types. Our results reveal a molecular mechanism underlying lung-specific metastasis and identify LAPTM5 as a potential therapeutic target for cancers with lung metastasis.","The mechanisms that confer lung-specific metastasis in renal cell carcinomas (RCC) remain to be detailed. Here the authors show that LAPTM5 contributes to lung-specific metastasis of RCCs by suppressing BMP signalling and thus, enhancing self-renewal and cancer stem cell-like traits of RCCs.",2022-07-16
1348,Hidden spin-orbital texture at the \(\overline{{{\Gamma }}}\)-located valence band maximum of a transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductor,"Finding stimuli capable of driving an imbalance of spin-polarised electrons within a solid is the central challenge in the development of spintronic devices. However, without the aid of magnetism, routes towards this goal are highly constrained with only a few suitable pairings of compounds and driving mechanisms found to date. Here, through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission along with density functional theory, we establish how the p-derived bulk valence bands of semiconducting 1T-HfSe2 possess a local, ground-state spin texture spatially confined within each Se-sublayer due to strong sublayer-localised electric dipoles orientated along the c-axis. This hidden spin-polarisation manifests in a ‘coupled spin-orbital texture’ with in-equivalent contributions from the constituent p-orbitals. While the overall spin-orbital texture for each Se sublayer is in strict adherence to time-reversal symmetry (TRS), spin-orbital mixing terms with net polarisations at time-reversal invariant momenta are locally maintained. These apparent TRS-breaking contributions dominate, and can be selectively tuned between with a choice of linear light polarisation, facilitating the observation of pronounced spin-polarisations at the Brillouin zone centre for all kz. We discuss the implications for the generation of spin-polarised populations from 1T-structured transition metal dichalcogenides using a fixed energy, linearly polarised light source.","Materials with time reversal and inversion symmetry have a bulk band structure that is spin degenerate, however, they can still exhibit a hidden spin-polarization when probed in a specific way. Here, using angle and spin resolved photoemission, Clark et al reveal a hidden spin-polarization in 1T-HfSe2 that persists through the time reversal invariant momenta due to effective spin-orbital magnetisations",2022-07-16
1349,Loss of immunity-related GTPase GM4951 leads to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease without obesity,"Obesity and diabetes are well known risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the genetic factors contributing to the development of NAFLD remain poorly understood. Here we describe two semi-dominant allelic missense mutations (Oily and Carboniferous) of Predicted gene 4951 (Gm4951) identified from a forward genetic screen in mice. GM4951 deficient mice developed NAFLD on high fat diet (HFD) with no changes in body weight or glucose metabolism. Moreover, HFD caused a reduction in the level of Gm4951, which in turn promoted the development of NAFLD. Predominantly expressed in hepatocytes, GM4951 was verified as an interferon inducible GTPase. The NAFLD in Gm4951 knockout mice was associated with decreased lipid oxidation in the liver and no defect in hepatic lipid secretion. After lipid loading, hepatocyte GM4951 translocated to lipid droplets (LDs), bringing with it hydroxysteroid 17β-dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13), which in the absence of GM4951 did not undergo this translocation. We identified a rare non-obese mouse model of NAFLD caused by GM4951 deficiency and define a critical role for GTPase-mediated translocation in hepatic lipid metabolism.","Obesity is a major risk factor for fatty liver disease. Here, using a forward genetic screen, the authors identify the gene GM4951 as a GTPase involved in lipid oxidation and development of NAFLD in mice.",2022-07-16
1350,Post-recovery COVID-19 and incident heart failure in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) study,"Cardiac involvement has been noted in COVID-19 infection. However, the relationship between post-recovery COVID-19 and development of de novo heart failure has not been investigated in a large, nationally representative population. We examined post-recovery outcomes of 587,330 patients hospitalized in the United States (257,075 with COVID-19 and 330,255 without), using data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative study. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were older (51 vs. 46 years), more often male (49% vs. 42%), and less often White (61% vs. 69%). Over a median follow up of 367 days, 10,979 incident heart failure events occurred. After adjustments, COVID-19 hospitalization was associated with a 45% higher hazard of incident heart failure (hazard ratio = 1.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.39–1.51), with more pronounced associations among patients who were younger (P-interaction = 0.003), White (P-interaction = 0.005), or who had established cardiovascular disease (P-interaction = 0.005). In conclusion, COVID-19 hospitalization is associated with increased risk of incident heart failure.","The relationship between post-recovery COVID-19 and incident heart failure has not been investigated at scale. Here, the authors use electronic health records for ~600,000 patients in the US and find a higher rate of post-discharge incident heart failure in those hospitalised with COVID-19 than without.",2022-07-15
1351,Fermi surface tomography,"Fermi surfaces are essential for predicting, characterizing and controlling the properties of crystalline metals and semiconductors. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is the only technique directly probing the Fermi surface by measuring the Fermi momenta (kF) from energy- and angular distribution of photoelectrons dislodged by monochromatic light. Existing apparatus is able to determine a number of kF -vectors simultaneously, but direct high-resolution 3D Fermi surface mapping remains problematic. As a result, no such datasets exist, strongly limiting our knowledge about the Fermi surfaces. Here we show that using a simpler instrumentation it is possible to perform 3D-mapping within a very short time interval and with very high resolution. We present the first detailed experimental 3D Fermi surface as well as other experimental results featuring advantages of our technique. In combination with various light sources our methodology and instrumentation offer new opportunities for high-resolution ARPES in the physical and life sciences.","The Fermi surface is related to the energy distribution of electrons in a solid, and governs physical properties of metals and semiconductors. A new type of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, probing the Fermi surface and combining short recording time with high resolution, is now presented.",2022-07-15
1352,Inhibition of NMDA receptors through a membrane-to-channel path,"N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are transmembrane proteins that are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate and are found at most excitatory vertebrate synapses. NMDAR channel blockers, an antagonist class of broad pharmacological and clinical significance, inhibit by occluding the NMDAR ion channel. A vast literature demonstrates that NMDAR channel blockers, including MK-801, phencyclidine, ketamine, and the Alzheimer’s disease drug memantine, can bind and unbind only when the NMDAR channel is open. Here we use electrophysiological recordings from transfected tsA201 cells and cultured neurons, NMDAR structural modeling, and custom-synthesized compounds to show that NMDAR channel blockers can enter the channel through two routes: the well-known hydrophilic path from extracellular solution to channel through the open channel gate, and also a hydrophobic path from plasma membrane to channel through a gated fenestration (“membrane-to-channel inhibition” (MCI)). Our demonstration that ligand-gated channels are subject to MCI, as are voltage-gated channels, highlights the broad expression of this inhibitory mechanism.","Wilcox et al. (2022) show that NMDA receptor channel blockers, some of which are clinically important drugs, can access their binding site via 2 routes: a well-known path from the extracellular solution, and another path through the plasma membrane.",2022-07-15
1353,Cryo-EM structure of the human Kv3.1 channel reveals gating control by the cytoplasmic T1 domain,"Kv3 channels have distinctive gating kinetics tailored for rapid repolarization in fast-spiking neurons. Malfunction of this process due to genetic variants in the KCNC1 gene causes severe epileptic disorders, yet the structural determinants for the unusual gating properties remain elusive. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human Kv3.1a channel, revealing a unique arrangement of the cytoplasmic tetramerization domain T1 which facilitates interactions with C-terminal axonal targeting motif and key components of the gating machinery. Additional interactions between S1/S2 linker and turret domain strengthen the interface between voltage sensor and pore domain. Supported by molecular dynamics simulations, electrophysiological and mutational analyses, we identify several residues in the S4/S5 linker which influence the gating kinetics and an electrostatic interaction between acidic residues in α6 of T1 and R449 in the pore-flanking S6T helices. These findings provide insights into gating control and disease mechanisms and may guide strategies for the design of pharmaceutical drugs targeting Kv3 channels.","Here, Chi et al. report cryo-EM structures of the human Kv3.1a channel, revealing a unique arrangement of the cytoplasmic T1 domain, which allows the interactions with the C-terminal axonal targeting motif and key components of the gating machinery. These findings provide insights into the functional relevance of previously unknown interdomain interactions in Kv3 channels and may guide the design of new pharmaceutical drugs.",2022-07-15
1354,Hepatic non-parenchymal S100A9-TLR4-mTORC1 axis normalizes diabetic ketogenesis,"Unrestrained ketogenesis leads to life-threatening ketoacidosis whose incidence is high in patients with diabetes. While insulin therapy reduces ketogenesis this approach is sub-optimal. Here, we report an insulin-independent pathway able to normalize diabetic ketogenesis. By generating insulin deficient male mice lacking or re-expressing Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) only in liver or hepatocytes, we demonstrate that hepatic TLR4 in non-parenchymal cells mediates the ketogenesis-suppressing action of S100A9. Mechanistically, S100A9 acts extracellularly to activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in a TLR4-dependent manner. Accordingly, hepatic-restricted but not hepatocyte-restricted loss of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 (TSC1, an mTORC1 inhibitor) corrects insulin-deficiency-induced hyperketonemia. Therapeutically, recombinant S100A9 administration restrains ketogenesis and improves hyperglycemia without causing hypoglycemia in diabetic mice. Also, circulating S100A9 in patients with ketoacidosis is only marginally increased hence unveiling a window of opportunity to pharmacologically augment S100A9 for preventing unrestrained ketogenesis. In summary, our findings reveal the hepatic S100A9-TLR4-mTORC1 axis in non-parenchymal cells as a promising therapeutic target for restraining diabetic ketogenesis.","Excess ketogenesis can lead to ketoacidosis, a serious complication in patients with diabetes. Here the authors report an insulin independent pathway, the hepatic nonparenchymal S100A9-TLR4-mTORC1 axis, that is able to normalize diabetic ketogenesis and pre-clinical data to suggest potential for development of S100A9 based adjunctive therapy to insulin.",2022-07-15
1355,The Medical Segmentation Decathlon,"International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative assessment of image analysis algorithms. Although segmentation is the most widely investigated medical image processing task, the various challenges have been organized to focus only on specific clinical tasks. We organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)—a biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude of both tasks and modalities to investigate the hypothesis that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and potentially outperform a custom-designed solution. MSD results confirmed this hypothesis, moreover, MSD winner continued generalizing well to a wide range of other clinical problems for the next two years. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms generalize well when retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to scientists that are not versed in AI model training.","International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative assessment of image analysis algorithms. Here, the authors present the results of a biomedical image segmentation challenge, showing that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task.",2022-07-15
1356,MRTF specifies a muscle-like contractile module in Porifera,"Muscle-based movement is a hallmark of animal biology, but the evolutionary origins of myocytes are unknown. Although believed to lack muscles, sponges (Porifera) are capable of coordinated whole-body contractions that purge debris from internal water canals. This behavior has been observed for decades, but their contractile tissues remain uncharacterized with respect to their ultrastructure, regulation, and development. We examine the sponge Ephydatia muelleri and find tissue-wide organization of a contractile module composed of actin, striated-muscle myosin II, and transgelin, and that contractions are regulated by the release of internal Ca2+ stores upstream of the myosin-light-chain-kinase (MLCK) pathway. The development of this contractile module appears to involve myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) as part of an environmentally inducible transcriptional complex that also functions in muscle development, plasticity, and regeneration. As an actin-regulated force-sensor, MRTF-activity offers a mechanism for how the contractile tissues that line water canals can dynamically remodel in response to flow and can re-form normally from stem-cells in the absence of the intrinsic spatial cues typical of animal embryogenesis. We conclude that the contractile module of sponge tissues shares elements of homology with contractile tissues in other animals, including muscles, indicating descent from a common, multifunctional tissue in the animal stem-lineage.","Myocytes are a key cell type that enable animal movement, but their evolutionary origins remain unclear. Colgren and Nichols describe molecular and functional similarities between a contractile module in tissues of a sponge and muscle tissues in other animals, indicating a common evolutionary origin.",2022-07-15
1357,Spin-related symmetry breaking induced by half-disordered hybridization in BixEr2-xRu2O7 pyrochlores for acidic oxygen evolution,"While acidic oxygen evolution reaction plays a critical role in electrochemical energy conversion devices, the sluggish reaction kinetics and poor stability in acidic electrolyte challenges materials development. Unlike traditional nano-structuring approaches, this work focuses on the structural symmetry breaking to rearrange spin electron occupation and optimize spin-dependent orbital interaction to alter charge transfer between catalysts and reactants. Herein, we propose an atomic half-disordering strategy in multistage-hybridized BixEr2-xRu2O7 pyrochlores to reconfigure orbital degeneracy and spin-related electron occupation. This strategy involves controlling the bonding interaction of Bi-6s lone pair electrons, in which partial atom rearrangement makes the active sites transform into asymmetric high-spin states from symmetric low-spin states. As a result, the half-disordered BixEr2-xRu2O7 pyrochlores demonstrate an overpotential of ~0.18 V at 10 mA cm−2 accompanied with excellent stability of 100 h in acidic electrolyte. Our findings not only provide a strategy for designing atom-disorder-related catalysts, but also provides a deeper understanding of the spin-related acidic oxygen evolution reaction kinetics.","While water electrolysis offers a potential path for renewable hydrogen fuel, water oxidation electrocatalysts typically suffer from poor stabilities in acid. Here, authors prepare ruthenium-based pyrochlores and demonstrate promising activities and durabilities for acidic water electro-oxidation.",2022-07-15
1358,A synaptic signal for novelty processing in the hippocampus,"Episodic memory formation and recall are complementary processes that rely on opposing neuronal computations in the hippocampus. How this conflict is resolved in hippocampal circuits is unclear. To address this question, we obtained in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from dentate gyrus granule cells in head-fixed mice trained to explore and distinguish between familiar and novel virtual environments. We find that granule cells consistently show a small transient depolarisation upon transition to a novel environment. This synaptic novelty signal is sensitive to local application of atropine, indicating that it depends on metabotropic acetylcholine receptors. A computational model suggests that the synaptic response to novelty may bias granule cell population activity, which can drive downstream attractor networks to a new state, favouring the switch from recall to new memory formation when faced with novelty. Such a novelty-driven switch may enable flexible encoding of new memories while preserving stable retrieval of familiar ones.",Memory formation and recall are complementary processes within the hippocampus. Here the authors demonstrate a synaptic signal of novelty in the hippocampus and provide a computational framework for how such a novelty-driven switch may enable flexible encoding of new memories while preserving stable retrieval of familiar ones.,2022-07-15
1359,The surfaceome of multiple myeloma cells suggests potential immunotherapeutic strategies and protein markers of drug resistance,"The myeloma surface proteome (surfaceome) determines tumor interaction with the microenvironment and serves as an emerging arena for therapeutic development. Here, we use glycoprotein capture proteomics to define the myeloma surfaceome at baseline, in drug resistance, and in response to acute drug treatment. We provide a scoring system for surface antigens and identify CCR10 as a promising target in this disease expressed widely on malignant plasma cells. We engineer proof-of-principle chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CCR10 using its natural ligand CCL27. In myeloma models we identify proteins that could serve as markers of resistance to bortezomib and lenalidomide, including CD53, CD10, EVI2B, and CD33. We find that acute lenalidomide treatment increases activity of MUC1-targeting CAR-T cells through antigen upregulation. Finally, we develop a miniaturized surface proteomic protocol for profiling primary plasma cell samples with low inputs. These approaches and datasets may contribute to the biological, therapeutic, and diagnostic understanding of myeloma.","The myeloma cell surface proteome regulates plasma cell biology and delineates therapy targets. Here, the authors profile the myeloma surfaceome at baseline and in drug resistance, finding the potential target CCR10, and include a streamlined approach to primary sample analysis.",2022-07-15
1360,Building programmable multicompartment artificial cells incorporating remotely activated protein channels using microfluidics and acoustic levitation,"Intracellular compartments are functional units that support the metabolism within living cells, through spatiotemporal regulation of chemical reactions and biological processes. Consequently, as a step forward in the bottom-up creation of artificial cells, building analogous intracellular architectures is essential for the expansion of cell-mimicking functionality. Herein, we report the development of a droplet laboratory platform to engineer complex emulsion-based, multicompartment artificial cells, using microfluidics and acoustic levitation. Such levitated models provide free-standing, dynamic, definable droplet networks for the compartmentalisation of chemical species. Equally, they can be remotely operated with pneumatic, heating, and magnetic elements for post-processing, including the incorporation of membrane proteins; alpha-hemolysin; and mechanosensitive channel of large-conductance. The assembly of droplet networks is three-dimensionally patterned with fluidic input configurations determining droplet contents and connectivity, whilst acoustic manipulation can be harnessed to reconfigure the droplet network in situ. The mechanosensitive channel can be repeatedly activated and deactivated in the levitated artificial cell by the application of acoustic and magnetic fields to modulate membrane tension on demand. This offers possibilities beyond one-time chemically mediated activation to provide repeated, non-contact, control of membrane protein function. Collectively, this expands our growing capability to program and operate increasingly sophisticated artificial cells as life-like materials.","Engineering micro-emulsion plays a key role in the creation of bottom-up synthetic cells. Here, authors demonstrate a droplet laboratory platform to control membrane protein gating in functional artificial cell using microfluidics and acoustic levitation.",2022-07-15
1361,Cutaneous and acral melanoma cross-OMICs reveals prognostic cancer drivers associated with pathobiology and ultraviolet exposure,"Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is causally linked to cutaneous melanoma, yet the underlying epigenetic mechanisms, known as molecular sensors of exposure, have not been characterized in clinical biospecimens. Here, we integrate clinical, epigenome (DNA methylome), genome and transcriptome profiling of 112 cutaneous melanoma from two multi-ethnic cohorts. We identify UV-related alterations in regulatory regions and immunological pathways, with multi-OMICs cancer driver potential affecting patient survival. TAPBP, the top gene, is critically involved in immune function and encompasses several UV-altered methylation sites that were validated by targeted sequencing, providing cost-effective opportunities for clinical application. The DNA methylome also reveals non UV-related aberrations underlying pathological differences between the cutaneous and 17 acral melanomas. Unsupervised epigenomic mapping demonstrated that non UV-mutant cutaneous melanoma more closely resembles acral rather than UV-exposed cutaneous melanoma, with the latter showing better patient prognosis than the other two forms. These gene-environment interactions reveal translationally impactful mechanisms in melanomagenesis.","While cutaneous melanoma is linked to UV radiation, acral melanoma is not. Epigenetic mechanisms function as sensors to exposures and determinants of cell identity. Here, the authors use DNA methylation data to identify dysregulated pathways associated with UV radiation and pathobiology in cutaneous and acral melanomas.",2022-07-15
1362,Constrained CMIP6 projections indicate less warming and a slower increase in water availability across Asia,"Climate projections are essential for decision-making but contain non-negligible uncertainty. To reduce projection uncertainty over Asia, where half the world’s population resides, we develop emergent constraint relationships between simulated temperature (1970–2014) and precipitation (2015–2100) growth rates using 27 CMIP6 models under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. Here we show that, with uncertainty successfully narrowed by 12.1–31.0%, constrained future precipitation growth rates are 0.39 ± 0.18 mm year−1 (29.36 mm °C−1, SSP126), 0.70 ± 0.22 mm year−1 (20.03 mm °C−1, SSP245), 1.10 ± 0.33 mm year−1 (17.96 mm °C−1, SSP370) and 1.42 ± 0.35 mm year−1 (17.28 mm °C−1, SSP585), indicating overestimates of 6.0–14.0% by the raw CMIP6 models. Accordingly, future temperature and total evaporation growth rates are also overestimated by 3.4–11.6% and −2.1–13.0%, respectively. The slower warming implies a lower snow cover loss rate by 10.5–40.2%. Overall, we find the projected increase in future water availability is overestimated by CMIP6 over Asia.","Reduction of uncertainty in climate projections is a key issue for climate change adaptation. Here the authors show that an applying an emergent constraint effectively reduces projection uncertainty across Asia, and reveals less warming and a slower increase in water availability than previously estimated.",2022-07-15
1363,Partial freezing of rat livers extends preservation time by 5-fold,"The limited preservation duration of organs has contributed to the shortage of organs for transplantation. Recently, a tripling of the storage duration was achieved with supercooling, which relies on temperatures between −4 and −6 °C. However, to achieve deeper metabolic stasis, lower temperatures are required. Inspired by freeze-tolerant animals, we entered high-subzero temperatures (−10 to −15 °C) using ice nucleators to control ice and cryoprotective agents (CPAs) to maintain an unfrozen liquid fraction. We present this approach, termed partial freezing, by testing gradual (un)loading and different CPAs, holding temperatures, and storage durations. Results indicate that propylene glycol outperforms glycerol and injury is largely influenced by storage temperatures. Subsequently, we demonstrate that machine perfusion enhancements improve the recovery of livers after freezing. Ultimately, livers that were partially frozen for 5-fold longer showed favorable outcomes as compared to viable controls, although frozen livers had lower cumulative bile and higher liver enzymes.","The limited preservation duration of donor organs is a big problem. Here the authors report a method for the freezing of whole rat livers at temperatures between −10 °C to −15 °C for up to 5 days, based on freeze-tolerant wood frogs, and term this partial freezing.",2022-07-15
1364,Planar chiral metasurfaces with maximal and tunable chiroptical response driven by bound states in the continuum,"Optical metasurfaces with high quality factors (Q-factors) of chiral resonances can boost substantially light-matter interaction for various applications of chiral response in ultrathin, active, and nonlinear metadevices. However, current approaches lack the flexibility to enhance and tune the chirality and Q-factor simultaneously. Here, we suggest a design of chiral metasurface supporting bound state in the continuum (BIC) and demonstrate experimentally chiroptical responses with ultra-high Q-factors and near-perfect circular dichroism (CD = 0.93) at optical frequencies. We employ the symmetry-reduced meta-atoms with high birefringence supporting winding elliptical eigenstate polarizations with opposite helicity. It provides a convenient way for achieving the maximal planar chirality tuned by either breaking in-plane structure symmetry or changing illumination angle. Beyond linear CD, we also achieved strong near-field enhancement CD and near-unitary nonlinear CD in the same planar chiral metasurface design with circular eigen-polarization. Sharply resonant chirality realized in planar metasurfaces promises various practical applications including chiral lasers and chiral nonlinear filters.","Here, the authors employ the physics of chiral bound states in the continuum and suggest planar chiral metasurfaces with simultaneous ultrahigh quality factor and near-perfect circular dichroism in both linear regime and nonlinear regime.",2022-07-15
1365,SLITRK2 variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders impair excitatory synaptic function and cognition in mice,"SLITRK2 is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed at postsynaptic neurons that regulates neurite outgrowth and excitatory synapse maintenance. In the present study, we report on rare variants (one nonsense and six missense variants) in SLITRK2 on the X chromosome identified by exome sequencing in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. Functional studies showed that some variants displayed impaired membrane transport and impaired excitatory synapse-promoting effects. Strikingly, these variations abolished the ability of SLITRK2 wild-type to reduce the levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB in neurons. Moreover, Slitrk2 conditional knockout mice exhibited impaired long-term memory and abnormal gait, recapitulating a subset of clinical features of patients with SLITRK2 variants. Furthermore, impaired excitatory synapse maintenance induced by hippocampal CA1-specific cKO of Slitrk2 caused abnormalities in spatial reference memory. Collectively, these data suggest that SLITRK2 is involved in X-linked neurodevelopmental disorders that are caused by perturbation of diverse facets of SLITRK2 function.",The protein SLITRK2 plays an important role in synaptic communication. This study identifies X-linked SLITRK2 variants that underlie neurodevelopmental disorders by impairing excitatory synapses.,2022-07-15
1366,Somatic cell fate maintenance in mouse fetal testes via autocrine/paracrine action of AMH and activin B,"Fate determination and maintenance of fetal testes in most mammals occur cell autonomously as a result of the action of key transcription factors in Sertoli cells. However, the cases of freemartin, where an XX twin develops testis structures under the influence of an XY twin, imply that hormonal factor(s) from the XY embryo contribute to sex reversal of the XX twin. Here we show that in mouse XY embryos, Sertoli cell-derived anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and activin B together maintain Sertoli cell identity. Sertoli cells in the gonadal poles of XY embryos lacking both AMH and activin B transdifferentiate into their female counterpart granulosa cells, leading to ovotestis formation. The ovotestes remain to adulthood and produce both sperm and oocytes, although there are few of the former and the latter fail to mature. Finally, the ability of XY mice to masculinize ovaries is lost in the absence of these two factors. These results provide insight into fate maintenance of fetal testes through the action of putative freemartin factors.","Fate determination and maintenance of foetal testes in most animals occurs cell autonomously. Here the authors show in mouse XY embryos that Sertoli cell derived AMH and activin B together maintain Sertoli cell identity, and lack of both AMH and activin B leads to transdifferentiation into female granulosa cells.",2022-07-15
1367,Mechanical intelligence for learning embodied sensor-object relationships,"Intelligence involves processing sensory experiences into representations useful for prediction. Understanding sensory experiences and building these contextual representations without prior knowledge of sensor models and environment is a challenging unsupervised learning problem. Current machine learning methods process new sensory data using prior knowledge defined by either domain knowledge or datasets. When datasets are not available, data acquisition is needed, though automating exploration in support of learning is still an unsolved problem. Here we develop a method that enables agents to efficiently collect data for learning a predictive sensor model—without requiring domain knowledge, human input, or previously existing data—using ergodicity to specify the data acquisition process. This approach is based entirely on data-driven sensor characteristics rather than predefined knowledge of the sensor model and its physical characteristics. We learn higher quality models with lower energy expenditure during exploration for data acquisition compared to competing approaches, including both random sampling and information maximization. In addition to applications in autonomy, our approach provides a potential model of how animals use their motor control to develop high quality models of their sensors (sight, sound, touch) before having knowledge of their sensor capabilities or their surrounding environment.","Information-based search strategies are relevant for the learning of interacting agents dynamics and usually need predefined data. The authors propose a method to collect data for learning a predictive sensor model, without requiring domain knowledge, human input, or previously existing data.",2022-07-15
1368,Hypoxia induces HIF1α-dependent epigenetic vulnerability in triple negative breast cancer to confer immune effector dysfunction and resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy,"The hypoxic tumor microenvironment has been implicated in immune escape, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Using an in vitro culture system modeling human T cell dysfunction and exhaustion in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), we find that hypoxia suppresses immune effector gene expression, including in T and NK cells, resulting in immune effector cell dysfunction and resistance to immunotherapy. We demonstrate that hypoxia-induced factor 1α (HIF1α) interaction with HDAC1 and concurrent PRC2 dependency causes chromatin remolding resulting in epigenetic suppression of effector genes and subsequent immune dysfunction. Targeting HIF1α and the associated epigenetic machinery can reverse the immune effector dysfunction and overcome resistance to PD-1 blockade, as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo using syngeneic and humanized mice models. These findings identify a HIF1α-mediated epigenetic mechanism in immune dysfunction and provide a potential strategy to overcome immune resistance in TNBC.","Hypoxia can promote tumor escape from immune surveillance and immunotherapy. Here, the authors show that hypoxia induces T and NK cell dysfunction through HIF1α-mediated epigenetic suppression of effector gene expression, conferring resistance to anti-PD1 blockade in triple negative breast cancer models.",2022-07-15
1369,Conformational heterogeneity of molecules physisorbed on a gold surface at room temperature,"A quantitative single-molecule tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) study at room temperature remained a challenge due to the rapid structural dynamics of molecules exposed to air. Here, we demonstrate the hyperspectral TERS imaging of single or a few brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) molecules at room temperature, along with quantitative spectral analyses. Robust chemical imaging is enabled by the freeze-frame approach using a thin Al2O3 capping layer, which suppresses spectral diffusions and inhibits chemical reactions and contamination in air. For the molecules resolved spatially in the TERS image, a clear Raman peak variation up to 7.5 cm−1 is observed, which cannot be found in molecular ensembles. From density functional theory-based quantitative analyses of the varied TERS peaks, we reveal the conformational heterogeneity at the single-molecule level. This work provides a facile way to investigate the single-molecule properties in interacting media, expanding the scope of single-molecule vibrational spectroscopy studies.","Tip-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy at room temperature is complicated by molecular conformational dynamics, photobleaching, contaminations, and chemical reactions in air. This study demonstrates that a sub-nm protective layer of Al2O3 provides robust conditions for probing single-molecule conformations.",2022-07-15
1370,Recovery of Lutacidiplasmatales archaeal order genomes suggests convergent evolution in Thermoplasmatota,"The Terrestrial Miscellaneous Euryarchaeota Group has been identified in various environments, and the single genome investigated thus far suggests that these archaea are anaerobic sulfite reducers. We assemble 35 new genomes from this group that, based on genome analysis, appear to possess aerobic and facultative anaerobic lifestyles and may oxidise rather than reduce sulfite. We propose naming this order (representing 16 genera) “Lutacidiplasmatales” due to their occurrence in various acidic environments and placement within the phylum Thermoplasmatota. Phylum-level analysis reveals that Thermoplasmatota evolution had been punctuated by several periods of high levels of novel gene family acquisition. Several essential metabolisms, such as aerobic respiration and acid tolerance, were likely acquired independently by divergent lineages through convergent evolution rather than inherited from a common ancestor. Ultimately, this study describes the terrestrially prevalent Lutacidiciplasmatales and highlights convergent evolution as an important driving force in the evolution of archaeal lineages.","Genome recovery of the order Lutacidiplasmatales reveals that key genes for environmental specialisation were acquired multiple times in the Thermoplasmatota phylum, suggesting a crucial role of convergent evolution in archaeal habitat adaptation.",2022-07-15
1371,Trigger factor both holds and folds its client proteins,"ATP-independent chaperones like trigger factor are generally assumed to play passive roles in protein folding by acting as holding chaperones. Here we show that trigger factor plays a more active role. Consistent with a role as an aggregation inhibiting chaperone, we find that trigger factor rapidly binds to partially folded glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and prevents it from non-productive self-association by shielding oligomeric interfaces. In the traditional view of holding chaperone action, trigger factor would then be expected to transfer its client to a chaperone foldase system for complete folding. Unexpectedly, we noticed that GAPDH folds into a monomeric but otherwise rather native-like intermediate state while trigger factor-bound. Upon release from trigger factor, the mostly folded monomeric GAPDH rapidly self-associates into its native tetramer and acquires enzymatic activity without needing additional folding factors. The mechanism we propose here for trigger factor bridges the holding and folding activities of chaperone function.","Using Guanidium HCl denatured glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the authors provide in vitro evidence for the active involvement of the trigger factor (TF) in promoting the native folding of pre-unfolded client proteins, by preventing non-productive self-associations (misfolding) and by shielding oligomeric interfaces from aggregation.",2022-07-15
1372,Magnetic control over the fundamental structure of atomic wires,"When reducing the size of materials towards the nanoscale, magnetic properties can emerge due to structural variations. Here, we show the reverse effect, where the structure of nanomaterials is controlled by magnetic manipulations. Using the break-junction technique, we find that the interatomic distance in platinum atomic wires is shorter or longer by up to ∼20%, when a magnetic field is applied parallel or perpendicular to the wires during their formation, respectively. The magnetic field direction also affects the wire length, where longer (shorter) wires are formed under a parallel (perpendicular) field. Our experimental analysis, supported by calculations, indicates that the direction of the applied magnetic field promotes the formation of suspended atomic wires with a specific magnetization orientation associated with typical orbital characteristics, interatomic distance, and stability. A similar effect is found for various metal and metal-oxide atomic wires, demonstrating that magnetic fields can control the atomistic structure of different nanomaterials when applied during their formation stage.","Magnetic effects can emerge due to structural variations when the size of materials is reduced towards the nanoscale. Here, Chakrabarti et al demonstrates the opposite effect, showing that the interatomic distance in atomic wires changes by up to 20% depending on the orientation of an applied magnetic field.",2022-07-15
1373,"AMEERA-1 phase 1/2 study of amcenestrant, SAR439859, in postmenopausal women with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer","AMEERA-1 is a Phase 1/2 open-label single-arm study evaluating once-daily (QD) amcenestrant, an orally bioavailable selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader, in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2− advanced breast cancer (NCT03284957), who were mostly heavily pretreated (including targeted therapies and fulvestrant). In the dose escalation phase (Part A: n = 16), patients received amcenestrant 20-600 mg QD. Based on absence of dose-limiting toxicities, paired functional 18F-fluoroestradiol positron emission tomography, and pharmacokinetics, 400 mg QD was selected as recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the dose expansion phase (Part B: n = 49). No Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events or clinically significant cardiac/eye toxicities were reported. The Part B primary endpoint, confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 3/45 at the interim analysis and 5/46 (10.9%) at the final analysis. The overall clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 13/46 (28.3%). CBRs among patients with baseline wild-type and mutated ESR1 were 9/26 (34.6%) and 4/19 (21.1%), respectively. Paired tumor biopsy and cell-free DNA analyses revealed ER inhibition and degradation, and a reduction in detectable ESR1 mutations, including Y537S. In conclusion, amcenestrant at RP2D of 400 mg QD for monotherapy is well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities, and demonstrates preliminary antitumor activity irrespective of baseline ESR1 mutation status.","There is a need for potent and non-toxic estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists to overcome the limitations of existing endocrine therapies. Here the authors report the results from Arm 1 of the Phase 1/2 study (AMEERA-1) among postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2− advanced breast cancer, which evaluates the safety, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of amcenestrant administered as monotherapy.",2022-07-15
1374,"Responding to eruptive transitions during the 2020–2021 eruption of La Soufrière volcano, St. Vincent","A critical challenge during volcanic emergencies is responding to rapid changes in eruptive behaviour. Actionable advice, essential in times of rising uncertainty, demands the rapid synthesis and communication of multiple datasets with prognoses. The 2020–2021 eruption of La Soufrière volcano exemplifies these challenges: a series of explosions from 9–22 April 2021 was preceded by three months of effusive activity, which commenced with a remarkably low level of detected unrest. Here we show how the development of an evolving conceptual model, and the expression of uncertainties via both elicitation and scenarios associated with this model, were key to anticipating this transition. This not only required input from multiple monitoring datasets but contextualisation via state-of-the-art hazard assessments, and evidence-based knowledge of critical decision-making timescales and community needs. In addition, we share strategies employed as a consequence of constraints on recognising and responding to eruptive transitions in a resource-constrained setting, which may guide similarly challenged volcano observatories worldwide.","The 2020 – 2021 eruption of La Soufrière volcano transitioned from an effusive to explosive eruption style. Here the authors show that input from multiple monitoring datasets and an evolving conceptual model were key to anticipating and responding to the eruptive transition at the La Soufrière volcano, St. Vincent, in a resource-constrained setting.",2022-07-15
1375,Oncogenic BRAF induces whole-genome doubling through suppression of cytokinesis,"Melanomas and other solid tumors commonly have increased ploidy, with near-tetraploid karyotypes being most frequently observed. Such karyotypes have been shown to arise through whole-genome doubling events that occur during early stages of tumor progression. The generation of tetraploid cells via whole-genome doubling is proposed to allow nascent tumor cells the ability to sample various pro-tumorigenic genomic configurations while avoiding the negative consequences that chromosomal gains or losses have in diploid cells. Whereas a high prevalence of whole-genome doubling events has been established, the means by which whole-genome doubling arises is unclear. Here, we find that BRAFV600E, the most common mutation in melanomas, can induce whole-genome doubling via cytokinesis failure in vitro and in a zebrafish melanoma model. Mechanistically, BRAFV600E causes decreased activation and localization of RhoA, a critical cytokinesis regulator. BRAFV600E activity during G1/S phases of the cell cycle is required to suppress cytokinesis. During G1/S, BRAFV600E activity causes inappropriate centriole amplification, which is linked in part to inhibition of RhoA and suppression of cytokinesis. Together these data suggest that common abnormalities of melanomas linked to tumorigenesis – amplified centrosomes and whole-genome doubling events – can be induced by oncogenic BRAF and other mutations that increase RAS/MAPK pathway activity.",Whole-genome doubling (WGD) commonly occurs in many solid tumors. Here the authors use a zebrafish model of melanoma and in vitro models to show that BRAFV600E induces WGD via inhibition of RhoA and cytokinesis failure.,2022-07-15
1376,Decapod-inspired pigment modulation for active building facades,"Typical buildings are static structures, unable to adjust to dynamic temperature and daylight fluctuations. Adaptive facades that are responsive to these unsteady solar conditions can substantially reduce operational energy inefficiencies, indoor heating, cooling, and lighting costs, as well as greenhouse-gas emissions. Inspired by marine organisms that disperse pigments within their skin, we propose an adaptive building interface that uses reversible fluid injections to tune optical transmission. Pigmented fluids with tunable morphologies are reversibly injected and withdrawn from confined layers, achieving locally-adjustable shading and interior solar exposure. Multicell arrays tiled across large areas enable differential and dynamic building responses, demonstrated using both experimental and simulated approaches. Fluidic reconfigurations can find optimal states over time to reduce heating, cooling, and lighting energy in our models by over 30% compared to current available electrochromic technologies.","Typical buildings are static structures, unable to adjust to dynamic temperature and daylight fluctuations. Here, authors present an adaptive alternative, using shape-tuneable pigment injections to control solar ingress and reduce estimated building energy use by 30%.",2022-07-15
1377,Barents-Kara sea-ice decline attributed to surface warming in the Gulf Stream,"Decline in winter sea-ice concentration (SIC) in the Barents-Kara Sea significantly impacts climate through increased heat release to the atmosphere. However, the past Barents-Kara SIC decrease rate is underestimated in the majority of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate models. Here we show that climate model simulations can reproduce the Barents-Kara SIC trend for 1970–2017 when sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the Gulf Stream region is constrained by observations. The constrained warming of the Gulf Stream strengthens ocean heat transport to the Barents-Kara Sea that enhances the SIC decline. The linear trends between the SIC and SST are highly correlated in the CMIP6 ensemble, suggesting that the externally forced component of the Gulf Stream SST increase explains up to 56% of the forced Barents-Kara SIC trend. Therefore, future warming of the Gulf Stream can be an essential pacemaker of the SIC decline.",Climate model simulations show that for 1970-2017 externally-forced sea surface temperature increases in the Gulf Stream explain up to 56% of the sea-ice decline in the Barents-Kara Sea during winter via poleward oceanic heat transport.,2022-07-15
1378,Humanized mice for investigating sustained Plasmodium vivax blood-stage infections and transmission,"Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria parasite. Due to the presence of extravascular reservoirs and relapsing infections from dormant liver stages, P. vivax is particularly difficult to control and eliminate. Experimental research is hampered by the inability to maintain P. vivax cultures in vitro, due to its tropism for immature red blood cells (RBCs). Here, we describe a new humanized mice model that can support efficient human erythropoiesis and maintain long-lasting multiplication of inoculated cryopreserved P. vivax parasites and their sexual differentiation, including in bone marrow. Mature gametocytes were transmitted to Anopheles mosquitoes, which led to the formation of salivary gland sporozoites. Importantly, blood-stage P. vivax parasites were maintained after the secondary transfer of fresh or frozen infected bone marrow cells to naïve chimeras. This model provides a unique tool for investigating, in vivo, the biology of intraerythrocytic P. vivax.","Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria parasite but due to its tropism for immature red blood cells in vitro culturing and studies are difficult. Here, LuizaBatista et al. generate a humanized mouse supporting human erythropoiesis and allowing asexual and sexual development of P. vivax in bone marrow and peripheral blood, as well as transmission to mosquitoes.",2022-07-15
1379,Phagocytosis of Plasmodium falciparum ring-stage parasites predicts protection against malaria,"Ring-infected erythrocytes are the predominant asexual stage in the peripheral circulation but are rarely investigated in the context of acquired immunity against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Here we compare antibody-dependent phagocytosis of ring-infected parasite cultures in samples from a controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study (NCT02739763). Protected volunteers did not develop clinical symptoms, maintained parasitaemia below a predefined threshold of 500 parasites/μl and were not treated until the end of the study. Antibody-dependent phagocytosis of both ring-infected and uninfected erythrocytes from parasite cultures was strongly correlated with protection. A surface proteomic analysis revealed the presence of merozoite proteins including erythrocyte binding antigen-175 and −140 on ring-infected and uninfected erythrocytes, providing an additional antibody-mediated protective mechanism for their activity beyond invasion-inhibition. Competition phagocytosis assays support the hypothesis that merozoite antigens are the key mediators of this functional activity. Targeting ring-stage parasites may contribute to the control of parasitaemia and prevention of clinical malaria.",Here the authors show that antibody-dependent phagocytosis of ring-stage P. falciparum parasites is mediated by merozoite antigens and is a strong predictor of protection following challenge in a controlled human malaria infection study in semi-immune Kenyan adults.,2022-07-14
1380,Development of vanadium-based polyanion positive electrode active materials for high-voltage sodium-based batteries,"Polyanion compounds offer a playground for designing prospective electrode active materials for sodium-ion storage due to their structural diversity and chemical variety. Here, by combining a NaVPO4F composition and KTiOPO4-type framework via a low-temperature (e.g., 190 °C) ion-exchange synthesis approach, we develop a high-capacity and high-voltage positive electrode active material. When tested in a coin cell configuration in combination with a Na metal negative electrode and a NaPF6-based non-aqueous electrolyte solution, this cathode active material enables a discharge capacity of 136 mAh g−1 at 14.3 mA g−1 with an average cell discharge voltage of about 4.0 V. Furthermore, a specific discharge capacity of 123 mAh g−1 at 5.7 A g−1 is also reported for the same cell configuration. Through ex situ and operando structural characterizations, we also demonstrate that the reversible Na-ion storage at the positive electrode occurs mostly via a solid-solution de/insertion mechanism.","The development of high-capacity and high-voltage electrode materials can boost the performance of sodium-based batteries. Here, the authors report the synthesis of a polyanion positive electrode active material that enables high-capacity and high-voltage sodium battery performance.",2022-07-14
1381,Computational imaging of moving objects obscured by a random corridor via speckle correlations,"Computational imaging makes it possible to reconstruct hidden objects through random media and around corners, which is of fundamental importance in various fields. Despite recent advances, computational imaging has not been studied in certain types of random scenarios, such as tortuous corridors filled with random media. We refer to this category of complex environment as a ’random corridor’, and propose a reduced spatial- and ensemble-speckle intensity correlation (RSESIC) method to image a moving object obscured by a random corridor. Experimental results show that the method can reconstruct the image of a centimeter-sized hidden object with a sub-millimeter resolution by a low-cost digital camera. The imaging capability depends on three system parameters and can be characterized by the correlation fidelity (CF). Furthermore, the RSESIC method is able to recover the image of objects even for a single pixel containing the contribution of about 102 speckle grains, which overcomes the theoretical limitation of traditional speckle imaging methods. Last but not least, when the power attenuation of speckle intensity leads to serious deterioration of CF, the image of hidden objects can still be reconstructed by the corrected intensity correlation.",The authors demonstrate an approach for imaging moving objects through a tortuous corridor filled with a random media. Their reduced spatial- and ensemble-speckle intensity correlation method allows for reconstruction of centimeter-sized hidden object with sub-millimeter resolution.,2022-07-14
1382,Fabrication of triboelectric polymer films via repeated rheological forging for ultrahigh surface charge density,"Triboelectric polymer with high charge density is the foundation to promote the wide range of applications of triboelectric nanogenerators. This work develops a method to produce triboelectric polymer based on repeated rheological forging. The fluorinated ethylene propylene film fabricated by repeated forging method not only has excellent mechanical properties and good transmittance, but also can maintain an ultrahigh tribo-charge density. Based on the film with a thickness of 30 μm, the output charge density from contact-separation nanogenerator reaches 352 μC·m−2. Then, the same film is applied for the nanogenerator with air-breakdown mode and a charge density of 510 μC·m−2 is further achieved. The repeated forging method can effectively regulate the composition of surface functional groups, the crystallinity, and the dielectric constants of the fluorinated ethylene propylene, leading to the superior capability of triboelectrification. Finally, we summarize the key parameters for elevating the electrification performance on the basis of molecular structure and related fabrication crafts, which can guide the further development of triboelectric polymers.","High charge density is the foundation to promote a wide range of applications of triboelectric nanogenerators. Here, authors propose a processing method based on the repeated rheological forging of triboelectric polymers achieving an enhanced triboelectricity and further study its mechanism.",2022-07-14
1383,Inhibition of myeloid-derived suppressor cell arginase-1 production enhances T-cell-based immunotherapy against Cryptococcus neoformans infection,"Cryptococcosis is a potentially lethal disease that is primarily caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, treatment options for cryptococcosis are limited. Here, we show glucuronoxylomannan, the major polysaccharide component of C. neoformans, induces the recruitment of neutrophilic myeloid-derived suppressor cells in mice and patients with cryptococcosis. Depletion of neutrophilic myeloid-derived suppressor cells enhances host defense against C. neoformans infection. We identify C-type lectin receptor-2d recognizes glucuronoxylomannan to potentiate the immunosuppressive activity of neutrophilic myeloid-derived suppressor cells by initiating p38-mediated production of the enzyme arginase-1, which inhibits T-cell mediated antifungal responses. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of arginase-1 expression by a specific inhibitor of p38, SB202190, or an orally available receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, significantly enhances T-cell mediated antifungal responses against cryptococcosis. These data reveal a crucial suppressive role of neutrophilic myeloid-derived suppressor cells during cryptococcosis and highlight a promising immunotherapeutic application by inhibiting arginase-1 production to combat infectious diseases.",Cryptococcus neoformans causes opportunistic infection and potentially lethal immunopathology but therapeutic options are limited. Here the authors implicate myeloid derived suppressor cells during C. neoformans infection and suggest targeting arginase-1 production as a potential therapeutic strategy.,2022-07-14
1384,Breaking photoswitch activation depth limit using ionising radiation stimuli adapted to clinical application,"Electromagnetic radiation-triggered therapeutic effect has attracted a great interest over the last 50 years. However, translation to clinical applications of photoactive molecular systems developed to date is dramatically limited, mainly because their activation requires excitation by low-energy photons from the ultraviolet to near infra-red range, preventing any activation deeper than few millimetres under the skin. Herein we conceive a strategy for photosensitive-system activation potentially adapted to biological tissues without any restriction in depth. High-energy stimuli, such as those employed for radiotherapy, are used to carry energy while molecular activation is provided by local energy conversion. This concept is applied to azobenzene, one of the most established photoswitches, to build a radioswitch. The radiation-responsive molecular system developed is used to trigger cytotoxic effect on cancer cells upon gamma-ray irradiation. This breakthrough activation concept is expected to expand the scope of applications of photosensitive systems and paves the way towards the development of original therapeutic approaches.","Triggered therapeutics are of interest but currently suffer from limited penetration depth of light sources. Here, the authors report on the development of a system, called radioswitch, that uses ionising irradiation to switch an azobenzene modified drug to an active form for deep tissue triggered therapeutic application.",2022-07-14
1385,Sub-nanometer mapping of strain-induced band structure variations in planar nanowire core-shell heterostructures,"Strain relaxation mechanisms during epitaxial growth of core-shell nanostructures play a key role in determining their morphologies, crystal structure and properties. To unveil those mechanisms, we perform atomic-scale aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy studies on planar core-shell ZnSe@ZnTe nanowires on α-Al2O3 substrates. The core morphology affects the shell structure involving plane bending and the formation of low-angle polar boundaries. The origin of this phenomenon and its consequences on the electronic band structure are discussed. We further use monochromated valence electron energy-loss spectroscopy to obtain spatially resolved band-gap maps of the heterostructure with sub-nanometer spatial resolution. A decrease in band-gap energy at highly strained core-shell interfacial regions is found, along with a switch from direct to indirect band-gap. These findings represent an advance in the sub-nanometer-scale understanding of the interplay between structure and electronic properties associated with highly mismatched semiconductor heterostructures, especially with those related to the planar growth of heterostructured nanowire networks.","Planar growth of nanowire arrays involves interactions between materials that affect the electronic behavior of the effective heterojunction. Here, authors show how core curvature and cross-section morphology affect shell growth, demonstrating how strain at the core-shell interface induces electronic band modulations in ZnSe@ZnTe nanowires.",2022-07-14
1386,Microglia coordinate cellular interactions during spinal cord repair in mice,"Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a neuro-inflammatory response dominated by tissue-resident microglia and monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs). Since activated microglia and MDMs are morphologically identical and express similar phenotypic markers in vivo, identifying injury responses specifically coordinated by microglia has historically been challenging. Here, we pharmacologically depleted microglia and use anatomical, histopathological, tract tracing, bulk and single cell RNA sequencing to reveal the cellular and molecular responses to SCI controlled by microglia. We show that microglia are vital for SCI recovery and coordinate injury responses in CNS-resident glia and infiltrating leukocytes. Depleting microglia exacerbates tissue damage and worsens functional recovery. Conversely, restoring select microglia-dependent signaling axes, identified through sequencing data, in microglia depleted mice prevents secondary damage and promotes recovery. Additional bioinformatics analyses reveal that optimal repair after SCI might be achieved by co-opting key ligand-receptor interactions between microglia, astrocytes and MDMs.","Here the authors show, using microglia-specific depletion techniques and single cell transcriptomics, that optimal repair after murine spinal cord injury (SCI) requires microglia.",2022-07-14
1387,A time-resolved multi-omics atlas of Acanthamoeba castellanii encystment,"Encystment is a common stress response of most protists, including free-living amoebae. Cyst formation protects the amoebae from eradication and can increase virulence of the bacteria they harbor. Here, we mapped the global molecular changes that occur in the facultatively pathogenic amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii during the early steps of the poorly understood process of encystment. By performing transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic experiments during encystment, we identified more than 150,000 previously undescribed transcripts and thousands of protein sequences absent from the reference genome. These results provide molecular details to the regulation of expected biological processes, such as cell proliferation shutdown, and reveal new insights such as a rapid phospho-regulation of sites involved in cytoskeleton remodeling and translation regulation. This work constitutes the first time-resolved molecular atlas of an encysting organism and a useful resource for further investigation of amoebae encystment to allow for a better control of pathogenic amoebae.","Encystment is a process that allows free-living and parasitic amoebae to survive in unfavorable environments.

1388,Controlled activation of cortical astrocytes modulates neuropathic pain-like behaviour,"Chronic pain is a major public health problem that currently lacks effective treatment options. Here, a method that can modulate chronic pain-like behaviour induced by nerve injury in mice is described. By combining a transient nerve block to inhibit noxious afferent input from injured peripheral nerves, with concurrent activation of astrocytes in the somatosensory cortex (S1) by either low intensity transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or via the chemogenetic DREADD system, we could reverse allodynia-like behaviour previously established by partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL). Such activation of astrocytes initiated spine plasticity to reduce those synapses formed shortly after PSL. This reversal from allodynia-like behaviour persisted well beyond the active treatment period. Thus, our study demonstrates a robust and potentially translational approach for modulating pain, that capitalizes on the interplay between noxious afferents, sensitized central neuronal circuits, and astrocyte-activation induced synaptic plasticity.","Astrocytes may contribute to synaptic remodelling in the cortex in chronic pain states. Here the authors describe modulation of astrocyte activity to drive circuit reorganization in somatosensory cortex in mice, along with peripheral nerve block, which could be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of chronic pain.",2022-07-14
1389,Local bifurcation with spin-transfer torque in superparamagnetic tunnel junctions,"Modulation of the energy landscape by external perturbations governs various thermally-activated phenomena, described by the Arrhenius law. Thermal fluctuation of nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions with spin-transfer torque (STT) shows promise for unconventional computing, whereas its rigorous representation, based on the Néel-Arrhenius law, has been controversial. In particular, the exponents for thermally-activated switching rate therein, have been inaccessible with conventional thermally-stable nanomagnets with decade-long retention time. Here we approach the Néel-Arrhenius law with STT utilising superparamagnetic tunnel junctions that have high sensitivity to external perturbations and determine the exponents through several independent measurements including homodyne-detected ferromagnetic resonance, nanosecond STT switching, and random telegraph noise. Furthermore, we show that the results are comprehensively described by a concept of local bifurcation observed in various physical systems. The findings demonstrate the capability of superparamagnetic tunnel junction as a useful tester for statistical physics as well as sophisticated engineering of probabilistic computing hardware with a rigorous mathematical foundation.","There has been much interest in using the probabilistic switching of magnetic tunnel junctions in unconventional computing, but to do so requires a detailed understanding of this switching. Here, Funatsu et al rigorously determine the switching exponents in superparamagnetic tunnel junctions.",2022-07-14
1390,Structures of β1-adrenergic receptor in complex with Gs and ligands of different efficacies,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) receive signals from ligands with different efficacies, and transduce to heterotrimeric G-proteins to generate different degrees of physiological responses. Previous studies revealed how ligands with different efficacies activate GPCRs. Here, we investigate how a GPCR activates G-proteins upon binding ligands with different efficacies. We report the cryo-EM structures of β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) in complex with Gs (GαsGβ1Gγ2) and a partial agonist or a very weak partial agonist, and compare them to the β1-AR–Gs structure in complex with a full agonist. Analyses reveal similar overall complex architecture, with local conformational differences. Cellular functional studies with mutations of β1-AR residues show effects on the cellular signaling from β1-AR to the cAMP response initiated by the three different ligands, with residue-specific functional differences. Biochemical investigations uncover that the intermediate state complex comprising β1-AR and nucleotide-free Gs is more stable when binding a full agonist than a partial agonist. Molecular dynamics simulations support the local conformational flexibilities and different stabilities among the three complexes. These data provide insights into the ligand efficacy in the activation of GPCRs and G-proteins.","Su et al. report cryo-EM structures of β1-adrenergic receptor, Gs and ligands of different efficacies. These complexes have similar overall architecture, but with local conformational differences and different stabilities.",2022-07-14
1391,Prolonging valley polarization lifetime through gate-controlled exciton-to-trion conversion in monolayer molybdenum ditelluride,"Monolayer 2D semiconductors provide an attractive option for valleytronics due to valley-addressability. But the short valley-polarization lifetimes for excitons have hindered potential valleytronic applications. In this paper, we demonstrate a strategy for prolonging the valley-polarization lifetime by converting excitons to trions through efficient gate control and exploiting the much longer valley-polarization lifetimes for trions than for excitons. At charge neutrality, the valley lifetime of monolayer MoTe2 increases by a factor of 1000 to the order of nanoseconds from excitons to trions. The exciton-to-trion conversion changes the dominant depolarization mechanism from the fast electron-hole exchange for excitons to the slow spin-flip process for trions. Moreover, the degree of valley polarization increases to 38% for excitons and 33% for trions through electrical manipulation. Our results reveal the depolarization dynamics and the interplay of various depolarization channels for excitons and trions, providing an effective strategy for prolonging the valley polarization.","Here, the authors devise a strategy for prolonging the valley polarization lifetime in monolayer MoTe2 by converting excitons to trions through gate control, and by taking advantage of the longer valley polarization lifetime of trions.",2022-07-14
1392,Contrasting suitability and ambition in regional carbon mitigation,"Substantially enhancing carbon mitigation ambition is a crucial step towards achieving the Paris climate goal. Yet this attempt is hampered by poor knowledge on the potential cost and benefit of emission mitigation for each emitter. Here we use a global economic model to assess the mitigation costs for 27 major emitting countries and regions, and further contrast the costs against the potential benefits of mitigation valued as avoided social cost of carbon and the mitigation ambition of each region. We find a strong negative spatial correlation between cost and benefit of mitigating each ton of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, the relative suitability of carbon mitigation, defined as the ratio of normalized benefit to normalized cost, also shows a considerable geographical mismatch with the mitigation ambition of emitters indicated in their first submitted nationally determined contributions. Our work provides important information to improve concerted climate action and formulate more efficient carbon mitigation strategies.","New study finds geographical mismatch in cross-regional ranking between cost and benefit of carbon mitigation, as well as spatial mismatch between relative suitability of mitigation and mitigation ambition of emitters.",2022-07-14
1393,Accelerated lysine metabolism conveys kidney protection in salt-sensitive hypertension,"Hypertension and kidney disease have been repeatedly associated with genomic variants and alterations of lysine metabolism. Here, we combined stable isotope labeling with untargeted metabolomics to investigate lysine’s metabolic fate in vivo. Dietary 13C6 labeled lysine was tracked to lysine metabolites across various organs. Globally, lysine reacts rapidly with molecules of the central carbon metabolism, but incorporates slowly into proteins and acylcarnitines. Lysine metabolism is accelerated in a rat model of hypertension and kidney damage, chiefly through N-alpha-mediated degradation. Lysine administration diminished development of hypertension and kidney injury. Protective mechanisms include diuresis, further acceleration of lysine conjugate formation, and inhibition of tubular albumin uptake. Lysine also conjugates with malonyl-CoA to form a novel metabolite Nε-malonyl-lysine to deplete malonyl-CoA from fatty acid synthesis. Through conjugate formation and excretion as fructoselysine, saccharopine, and Nε-acetyllysine, lysine lead to depletion of central carbon metabolites from the organism and kidney. Consistently, lysine administration to patients at risk for hypertension and kidney disease inhibited tubular albumin uptake, increased lysine conjugate formation, and reduced tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites, compared to kidney-healthy volunteers. In conclusion, lysine isotope tracing mapped an accelerated metabolism in hypertension, and lysine administration could protect kidneys in hypertensive kidney disease.","Kidney metabolism in disease is important but not well understood. Here, using isotope-guided metabolomics, the authors show that lysine’s metabolic activity conveys kidney protection in hypertension through accelerated metabolism and physiological effects on tubular function.",2022-07-14
1394,Auxotrophic and prototrophic conditional genetic networks reveal the rewiring of transcription factors in Escherichia coli,"Bacterial transcription factors (TFs) are widely studied in Escherichia coli. Yet it remains unclear how individual genes in the underlying pathways of TF machinery operate together during environmental challenge. Here, we address this by applying an unbiased, quantitative synthetic genetic interaction (GI) approach to measure pairwise GIs among all TF genes in E. coli under auxotrophic (rich medium) and prototrophic (minimal medium) static growth conditions. The resulting static and differential GI networks reveal condition-dependent GIs, widespread changes among TF genes in metabolism, and new roles for uncharacterized TFs (yjdC, yneJ, ydiP) as regulators of cell division, putrescine utilization pathway, and cold shock adaptation. Pan-bacterial conservation suggests TF genes with GIs are co-conserved in evolution. Together, our results illuminate the global organization of E. coli TFs, and remodeling of genetic backup systems for TFs under environmental change, which is essential for controlling the bacterial transcriptional regulatory circuits.","The bacterium E. coli has around 300 transcriptional factors, but the functions of many of them, and the interactions between their respective regulatory networks, are unclear. Here, the authors study genetic interactions among all transcription factor genes in E. coli, revealing condition-dependent interactions and roles for uncharacterized transcription factors.",2022-07-14
1395,Identifying multicellular spatiotemporal organization of cells with SpaceFlow,"One major challenge in analyzing spatial transcriptomic datasets is to simultaneously incorporate the cell transcriptome similarity and their spatial locations. Here, we introduce SpaceFlow, which generates spatially-consistent low-dimensional embeddings by incorporating both expression similarity and spatial information using spatially regularized deep graph networks. Based on the embedding, we introduce a pseudo-Spatiotemporal Map that integrates the pseudotime concept with spatial locations of the cells to unravel spatiotemporal patterns of cells. By comparing with multiple existing methods on several spatial transcriptomic datasets at both spot and single-cell resolutions, SpaceFlow is shown to produce a robust domain segmentation and identify biologically meaningful spatiotemporal patterns. Applications of SpaceFlow reveal evolving lineage in heart developmental data and tumor-immune interactions in human breast cancer data. Our study provides a flexible deep learning framework to incorporate spatiotemporal information in analyzing spatial transcriptomic data.","A critical task in spatial transcriptomics analysis is to understand inherently spatial relationships among cells.

1396,Cell-autonomous Hedgehog signaling controls Th17 polarization and pathogenicity,"Th17 cells are key drivers of autoimmune disease. However, the signaling pathways regulating Th17 polarization are poorly understood. Hedgehog signaling regulates cell fate decisions during embryogenesis and adult tissue patterning. Here we find that cell-autonomous Hedgehog signaling, independent of exogenous ligands, selectively drives the polarization of Th17 cells but not other T helper cell subsets. We show that endogenous Hedgehog ligand, Ihh, signals to activate both canonical and non-canonical Hedgehog pathways through Gli3 and AMPK. We demonstrate that Hedgehog pathway inhibition with either the clinically-approved small molecule inhibitor vismodegib or genetic ablation of Ihh in CD4+ T cells greatly diminishes disease severity in two mouse models of intestinal inflammation. We confirm that Hedgehog pathway expression is upregulated in tissue from human ulcerative colitis patients and correlates with Th17 marker expression. This work implicates Hedgehog signaling in Th17 polarization and intestinal immunopathology and indicates the potential therapeutic use of Hedgehog inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",Th17 cells are critical players in the immunopathology of a range of autoimmune diseases. Here the authors implicate Hedgehog signaling in Th17 polarization and in the immunopathology of intestinal inflammation in murine models and suggest therapeutic targeting of Hedgehog signaling in the context of inflammatory bowel disease.,2022-07-14
1397,Add drop multiplexers for terahertz communications using two-wire waveguide-based plasmonic circuits,"Terahertz (THz) band is considered to be the next frontier in wireless communications. The emerging THz multiplexing techniques are expected to dramatically increase the information capacity of THz communications far beyond a single channel limit. In this work, we explore the THz frequency-division multiplexing modality enabled by an add-drop multiplexer (ADM) design. Based on modular two-wire plasmonic waveguides fabricated using additive manufacturing and metallization techniques, we demonstrate four-port THz ADMs containing grating-loaded side couplers for operation at ~140 GHz carrier frequency. Particular attention is paid to the design of plasmonic waveguide Bragg gratings and directional couplers capable of splitting broadband THz light into spectral and spatial domains. Finally, we demonstrate multi/demultiplexing of THz signals with bit rates up to 6 Gbps using the developed ADMs. We believe that the proposed plasmonic circuits hold strong potential to provide robust integrated solutions for analog signal processing in the upcoming THz communications.","Using 3D-printed two-wire plasmonic circuits, the authors demonstrate add-drop THz multiplexers featuring a grating-loaded side coupler design. They confirm the channel Drop, Add, and Through actions using ~6 Gbps data streams at ~140 GHz carrier frequency.",2022-07-14
1398,Rising ecosystem water demand exacerbates the lengthening of tropical dry seasons,"Precipitation-based assessments show a lengthening of tropical dry seasons under climate change, without considering simultaneous changes in ecosystem water demand. Here, we compare changes in tropical dry season length and timing when dry season is defined as the period when precipitation is less than: its climatological average, potential evapotranspiration, or actual evapotranspiration. While all definitions show more widespread tropical drying than wetting for 1983-2016, we find the largest fraction (48.7%) of tropical land probably experiencing longer dry seasons when dry season is defined as the period when precipitation cannot meet the need of actual evapotranspiration. Southern Amazonia (due to delayed end) and central Africa (due to earlier onset and delayed end) are hotspots of dry season lengthening, with greater certainty when accounting for water demand changes. Therefore, it is necessary to account for changing water demand when characterizing changes in tropical dry periods and ecosystem water deficits.","Changing precipitation pattern has been suggested to expand tropical dry seasons. Here, the authors show that this lengthening can be even more severe when accounting for the simultaneous rise of ecosystem water demand in a warmer climate.",2022-07-14
1399,Equilibrated evolution of the mixed auto-/allopolyploid haplotype-resolved genome of the invasive hexaploid Prussian carp,"Understanding genome evolution of polyploids requires dissection of their often highly similar subgenomes and haplotypes. Polyploid animal genome assemblies so far restricted homologous chromosomes to a ‘collapsed’ representation. Here, we sequenced the genome of the asexual Prussian carp, which is a close relative of the goldfish, and present a haplotype-resolved chromosome-scale assembly of a hexaploid animal. Genome-wide comparisons of the 150 chromosomes with those of two ancestral diploid cyprinids and the allotetraploid goldfish and common carp revealed the genomic structure, phylogeny and genome duplication history of its genome. It consists of 25 syntenic, homeologous chromosome groups and evolved by a recent autoploid addition to an allotetraploid ancestor. We show that de-polyploidization of the alloploid subgenomes on the individual gene level occurred in an equilibrated fashion. Analysis of the highly conserved actinopterygian gene set uncovered a subgenome dominance in duplicate gene loss of one ancestral chromosome set.","The haplotype-resolved assembly of the asexual invasive Prussian carp shows six genome copies (AAABBB), evolved from two ancestral species by a recent self-addition (AB) to its hybrid-tetraploid (AABB) goldfish ancestor. Equilibrated gene loss led to subgenome dominance.",2022-07-14
1400,Topology mediates transport of nanoparticles in macromolecular networks,"Diffusion transport of nanoparticles in confined environments of macromolecular networks is common in diverse physical systems and regulates many biological responses. Macromolecular networks possess various topologies, featured by different numbers of degrees and genera. Although the network topologies can be manipulated from a molecular level, how the topology impacts the transport of nanoparticles in macromolecular networks remains unexplored. Here, we develop theoretical approaches combined with simulations to study nanoparticle transport in a model system consisting of network cells with defined topologies. We find that the topology of network cells has a profound effect on the free energy landscape experienced by a nanoparticle in the network cells, exhibiting various scaling laws dictated by the topology. Furthermore, the examination of the impact of cell topology on the detailed behavior of nanoparticle dynamics leads to different dynamical regimes that go beyond the particulars regarding the local network loop. The results might alter the conventional picture of the physical origin of transport in networks.","Macromolecular networks relevant for biological processes and technological applications, are often characterized by complex architectures. The authors uncover the impact of topology on the properties of nanoparticle transport in macromolecular networks.",2022-07-14
1401,Adipocyte lysoplasmalogenase TMEM86A regulates plasmalogen homeostasis and protein kinase A-dependent energy metabolism,"Dysregulation of adipose tissue plasmalogen metabolism is associated with obesity-related metabolic diseases. We report that feeding mice a high-fat diet reduces adipose tissue lysoplasmalogen levels and increases transmembrane protein 86 A (TMEM86A), a putative lysoplasmalogenase. Untargeted lipidomic analysis demonstrates that adipocyte-specific TMEM86A-knockout (AKO) increases lysoplasmalogen content in adipose tissue, including plasmenyl lysophosphatidylethanolamine 18:0 (LPE P-18:0). Surprisingly, TMEM86A AKO increases protein kinase A signalling pathways owing to inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3B and elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. TMEM86A AKO upregulates mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, elevates energy expenditure, and protects mice from metabolic dysfunction induced by high-fat feeding. Importantly, the effects of TMEM86A AKO are largely reproduced in vitro and in vivo by LPE P-18:0 supplementation. LPE P-18:0 levels are significantly lower in adipose tissue of human patients with obesity, suggesting that TMEM86A inhibition or lysoplasmalogen supplementation might be therapeutic approaches for preventing or treating obesity-related metabolic diseases.","Dysregulation of plasmalogen metabolism in adipose tissue is associated with metabolic diseases. Here the authors characterize the role of adipocyte TMEM86A as a lysoplasmalogenase and show its deletion is protective against high fat diet induced metabolic disease, an effect that can be recapitulated by plasmenyl lysophosphatidylethanolamine 18:0 supplementation.",2022-07-14
1402,Electric-field control of nonlinear THz spintronic emitters,"Energy-efficient spintronic technology holds tremendous potential for the design of next-generation processors to operate at terahertz frequencies. Femtosecond photoexcitation of spintronic materials generates sub-picosecond spin currents and emission of terahertz radiation with broad bandwidth. However, terahertz spintronic emitters lack an active material platform for electric-field control. Here, we demonstrate a nonlinear electric-field control of terahertz spin current-based emitters using a single crystal piezoelectric Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–PbTiO3 (PMN–PT) that endows artificial magnetoelectric coupling onto a spintronic terahertz emitter and provides 270% modulation of the terahertz field at remnant magnetization. The nonlinear electric-field control of the spins occurs due to the strain-induced change in magnetic energy of the ferromagnet thin-film. Results also reveal a robust and repeatable switching of the phase of the terahertz spin current. Electric-field control of terahertz spintronic emitters with multiferroics and strain engineering offers opportunities for the on-chip realization of tunable energy-efficient spintronic-photonic integrated platforms.","Spintronic terahertz (THz) emitters are a class of magnetic heterostructure where femtosecond laser excitations generate THz radiation emission. While they have great potential, electric field control of spintronic emitter remains a challenge. Here, by combining a spintronic emitter with a piezoelectric substrate, Agarwal et al. demonstrate electric field control of THz emission through induced piezostrain.",2022-07-14
1403,Ultraviolet supercontinuum generation driven by ionic coherence in a strong laser field,"Supercontinuum (SC) light sources hold versatile applications in many fields ranging from imaging microscopic structural dynamics to achieving frequency comb metrology. Although such broadband light sources are readily accessible in the visible and near infrared regime, the ultraviolet (UV) extension of SC spectrum is still challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the joint contribution of strong field ionization and quantum resonance leads to the unexpected UV continuum radiation spanning the 100 nm bandwidth in molecular nitrogen ions. Quantum coherences in a bunch of ionic levels are found to be created by dynamic Stark-assisted multiphoton resonances following tunneling ionization. We show that the dynamical evolution of the coherence-enhanced polarization wave gives rise to laser-assisted continuum emission inside the laser field and free-induction decay after the laser field, which jointly contribute to the SC generation together with fifth harmonics. As proof of principle, we also show the application of the SC radiation in the absorption spectroscopy. This work offers an alternative scheme for constructing exotic SC sources, and opens up the territory of ionic quantum optics in the strong-field regime.",Supercontinuum generation can be utilized for light source development. Here the authors demonstrate ultraviolet supercontinuum generation from ions due to strong field ionization and multiphoton resonance effect.,2022-07-14
1404,"Natural Killer cells demonstrate distinct eQTL and transcriptome-wide disease associations, highlighting their role in autoimmunity","Natural Killer cells are innate lymphocytes with central roles in immunosurveillance and are implicated in autoimmune pathogenesis. The degree to which regulatory variants affect Natural Killer cell gene expression is poorly understood. Here we perform expression quantitative trait locus mapping of negatively selected Natural Killer cells from a population of healthy Europeans (n = 245). We find a significant subset of genes demonstrate expression quantitative trait loci specific to Natural Killer cells and these are highly informative of human disease, in particular autoimmunity. A Natural Killer cell transcriptome-wide association study across five common autoimmune diseases identifies further novel associations at 27 genes. In addition to these cis observations, we find novel master-regulatory regions impacting expression of trans gene networks at regions including 19q13.4, the Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor region, GNLY, MC1R and UVSSA. Our findings provide new insights into the unique biology of Natural Killer cells, demonstrating markedly different expression quantitative trait loci from other immune cells, with implications for disease mechanisms.","Natural Killer cells are key mediators of anti-tumour immunosurveillance and anti-viral immunity. Here, the authors map regulatory genetic variation in primary Natural Killer cells, providing new insights into their role in human health and disease.",2022-07-14
1405,A monomeric mycobacteriophage immunity repressor utilizes two domains to recognize an asymmetric DNA sequence,"Regulation of bacteriophage gene expression involves repressor proteins that bind and downregulate early lytic promoters. A large group of mycobacteriophages code for repressors that are unusual in also terminating transcription elongation at numerous binding sites (stoperators) distributed across the phage genome. Here we provide the X-ray crystal structure of a mycobacteriophage immunity repressor bound to DNA, which reveals the binding of a monomer to an asymmetric DNA sequence using two independent DNA binding domains. The structure is supported by small-angle X-ray scattering, DNA binding, molecular dynamics, and in vivo immunity assays. We propose a model for how dual DNA binding domains facilitate regulation of both transcription initiation and elongation, while enabling evolution of other superinfection immune specificities.","Bacteriophage repressor proteins downregulate viral lytic gene expression. Herein, the authors present the X-ray crystal structure of a monomeric repressor that binds an asymmetric DNA sequence using two independent domains.",2022-07-14
1406,HRS phosphorylation drives immunosuppressive exosome secretion and restricts CD8+ T-cell infiltration into tumors,"The lack of tumor infiltration by CD8+ T cells is associated with poor patient response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Understanding how tumor infiltration is regulated is key to improving treatment efficacy. Here, we report that phosphorylation of HRS, a pivotal component of the ESCRT complex involved in exosome biogenesis, restricts tumor infiltration of cytolytic CD8+ T cells. Following ERK-mediated phosphorylation, HRS interacts with and mediates the selective loading of PD-L1 to exosomes, which inhibits the migration of CD8+ T cells into tumors. In tissue samples from patients with melanoma, CD8+ T cells are excluded from the regions where tumor cells contain high levels of phosphorylated HRS. In murine tumor models, overexpression of phosphorylated HRS increases resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment, whereas inhibition of HRS phosphorylation enhances treatment efficacy. Our study reveals a mechanism by which phosphorylation of HRS in tumor cells regulates anti-tumor immunity by inducing PD-L1+ immunosuppressive exosomes, and suggests HRS phosphorylation blockade as a potential strategy to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.","Lack of CD8+ T-cell infiltration into solid tumors is associated with poor responsiveness to immune checkpoint therapy (ICT). Here, the authors show that blocking the phosphorylation of HRS to reduce the induction of immunosuppressive exosomes promotes CD8+ T-cell infiltration into tumors and enhances the efficacy of ICT in mouse melanoma models.",2022-07-14
1407,Cryo-EM structure of anchorless RML prion reveals variations in shared motifs between distinct strains,"Little is known about the structural basis of prion strains. Here we provide a high (3.0 Å) resolution cryo-electron microscopy-based structure of infectious brain-derived fibrils of the mouse anchorless RML scrapie strain which, like the recently determined hamster 263K strain, has a parallel in-register β-sheet-based core. Several structural motifs are shared between these ex vivo prion strains, including an amino-proximal steric zipper and three β-arches. However, detailed comparisons reveal variations in these shared structural topologies and other features. Unlike 263K and wildtype RML prions, the anchorless RML prions lack glycophosphatidylinositol anchors and are severely deficient in N-linked glycans. Nonetheless, the similarity of our anchorless RML structure to one reported for wildtype RML prion fibrils in an accompanying paper indicates that these post-translational modifications do not substantially alter the amyloid core conformation. This work demonstrates both common and divergent structural features of prion strains at the near-atomic level.",The authors report the near-atomic structure of the ex vivo aRML prion fibril. The comparison between this structure and the previously solved 263K prion fibril shows that both common and divergent features characterize these prion strains and their respective conformational replication templates.,2022-07-13
1408,Desymmetrization of N-Cbz glutarimides through N-heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis,"Over the past decade, the catalysis of N-heterocyclic carbenes has achieved significant advances. In this area, aldehydes, enals, and esters, are commonly employed as starting materials through various catalytic activation modes. However, NHC-activated strategy of amide and its derivatives remains elusive. Described herein is the realization of asymmetric desymmetrization of N-Cbz glutarimides with alcohols through an imide C-N bond cleavage under NHC organocatalysis. A structurally diverse set of enantioenriched 4-amido esters is generated with acceptable yields and high enantioselectivities. This method features mild reaction conditions, excellent substrate scope, and excellent atom economy. DFT calculations have been performed to explore the detailed reaction mechanism and the origin of the enantioselectivity, which indicate that the strength of the C-H···O hydrogen bond and C–H⋯π interactions should be responsible for the stereoselectivity. The current strategy could open a door for efficient construction of (R)-Rolipram with excellent stereoselectivity.","Desymmetrization of achiral building blocks is one of the most efficient ways to access enantiopure compounds of synthetic relevance. Here, the authors desymmetrize glutarimides with alcohols via an imide C–N bond cleavage under NHC organocatalysis.",2022-07-13
1409,The intrinsically disordered protein TgIST from Toxoplasma gondii inhibits STAT1 signaling by blocking cofactor recruitment,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins communicate from cell-surface receptors to drive transcription of immune response genes. The parasite Toxoplasma gondii blocks STAT1-mediated gene expression by secreting the intrinsically disordered protein TgIST that traffics to the host nucleus, binds phosphorylated STAT1 dimers, and occupies nascent transcription sites that unexpectedly remain silenced. Here we define a core region within internal repeats of TgIST that is necessary and sufficient to block STAT1-mediated gene expression. Cellular, biochemical, mutational, and structural data demonstrate that the repeat region of TgIST adopts a helical conformation upon binding to STAT1 dimers. The binding interface is defined by a groove formed from two loops in the STAT1 SH2 domains that reorient during dimerization. TgIST binding to this newly exposed site at the STAT1 dimer interface alters its conformation and prevents the recruitment of co-transcriptional activators, thus defining the mechanism of blocked transcription.","Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) are pleotropic proteins with diverse functions. Here the authors show that an IDP, TgIST, from T. gondii blocks interferon-induced gene expression by binding to the STAT1 dimer interface and preventing the recruitment of co-transcriptional activators, CBP/p300, to STAT1 to inhibit expression of immunity genes.",2022-07-13
1410,A deep-learning estimate of the decadal trends in the Southern Ocean carbon storage,"Uptake of atmospheric carbon by the ocean, especially at high latitudes, plays an important role in offsetting anthropogenic emissions. At the surface of the Southern Ocean south of 30∘S, the ocean carbon uptake, which had been weakening in 1990s, strengthened in the 2000s. However, sparseness of in-situ measurements in the ocean interior make it difficult to compute changes in carbon storage below the surface. Here we develop a machine-learning model, which can estimate concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the Southern Ocean up to 4 km depth only using data available at the ocean surface. Our model is fast and computationally inexpensive. We apply it to calculate trends in DIC concentrations over the past three decades and find that DIC decreased in the 1990s and 2000s, but has increased, in particular in the upper ocean since the 2010s. However, the particular circulation dynamics that drove these changes may have differed across zonal sectors of the Southern Ocean. While the near-surface decrease in DIC concentrations would enhance atmospheric CO2 uptake continuing the previously-found trends, weakened connectivity between surface and deep layers and build-up of DIC in deep waters could reduce the ocean’s carbon storage potential.","Dissolved carbon concentrations in the ocean interior are computed by a deep-learning model using ocean surface data. In the Southern Ocean, they decreased in the 1990s-2000s and increased since 2010, reducing anthropogenic carbon uptake potential.",2022-07-13
1411,2.7 Å cryo-EM structure of ex vivo RML prion fibrils,"Mammalian prions propagate as distinct strains and are composed of multichain assemblies of misfolded host-encoded prion protein (PrP). Here, we present a near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structure of PrP fibrils present in highly infectious prion rod preparations isolated from the brains of RML prion-infected mice. We found that prion rods comprise single-protofilament helical amyloid fibrils that coexist with twisted pairs of the same protofilaments. Each rung of the protofilament is formed by a single PrP monomer with the ordered core comprising PrP residues 94–225, which folds to create two asymmetric lobes with the N-linked glycans and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor projecting from the C-terminal lobe. The overall architecture is comparable to that of recently reported PrP fibrils isolated from the brain of hamsters infected with the 263K prion strain. However, there are marked conformational variations that could result from differences in PrP sequence and/or represent distinguishing features of the distinct prion strains.","High-resolution structures of mammalian prions have remained elusive. Here, Manka et al. report the cryo-EM structure of infectious RML prion fibrils from mice. Structural similarity with recently reported infectious 263K prion fibrils from hamsters now suggests a common prion architecture.",2022-07-13
1412,A SOX17-PDGFB signaling axis regulates aortic root development,"Developmental etiologies causing complex congenital aortic root abnormalities are unknown. Here we show that deletion of Sox17 in aortic root endothelium in mice causes underdeveloped aortic root leading to a bicuspid aortic valve due to the absence of non-coronary leaflet and mispositioned left coronary ostium. The respective defects are associated with reduced proliferation of non-coronary leaflet mesenchyme and aortic root smooth muscle derived from the second heart field cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, SOX17 occupies a Pdgfb transcriptional enhancer to promote its transcription and Sox17 deletion inhibits the endothelial Pdgfb transcription and PDGFB growth signaling to the non-coronary leaflet mesenchyme. Restoration of PDGFB in aortic root endothelium rescues the non-coronary leaflet and left coronary ostium defects in Sox17 nulls. These data support a SOX17-PDGFB axis underlying aortic root development that is critical for aortic valve and coronary ostium patterning, thereby informing a potential shared disease mechanism for concurrent anomalous aortic valve and coronary arteries.",Little is known about the developmental causes of aortic root defects. Here the authors show that the inactivation of Sox17 in aortic root endothelium results in aortic root defects affecting aortic valve and coronary ostium.,2022-07-13
1413,Monomeric prefusion structure of an extremophile gamete fusogen and stepwise formation of the postfusion trimeric state,"Here, we study the gamete fusogen HAP2 from Cyanidioschyzon merolae (Cyani), an extremophile red algae that grows at acidic pH at 45 °C. HAP2 has a trimeric postfusion structure with similarity to viral class II fusion proteins, but its prefusion structure has been elusive. The crystal structure of a monomeric prefusion state of Cyani HAP2 shows it is highly extended with three domains in the order D2, D1, and D3. Three hydrophobic fusion loops at the tip of D2 are each required for postfusion state formation. We followed by negative stain electron microscopy steps in the process of detergent micelle-stimulated postfusion state formation. In an intermediate state, two or three linear HAP2 monomers associate at the end of D2 bearing its fusion loops. Subsequently, D2 and D1 line the core of a trimer and D3 folds back over the exterior of D1 and D2. D3 is not required for formation of intermediate or postfusion-like states.","Studies in the postfusion structures of the conserved gamete fusogen HAP2 show a trimeric state typical of viral class II fusion proteins. Here, the authors present the crystal structure of a prefusion state of Cyanidioschyzon merolae HAP2 and low resolution structures of intermediates in the pathway to its trimeric postfusion state.",2022-07-13
1414,Instant diagnosis of gastroscopic biopsy via deep-learned single-shot femtosecond stimulated Raman histology,"Gastroscopic biopsy provides the only effective method for gastric cancer diagnosis, but the gold standard histopathology is time-consuming and incompatible with gastroscopy. Conventional stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy has shown promise in label-free diagnosis on human tissues, yet it requires the tuning of picosecond lasers to achieve chemical specificity at the cost of time and complexity. Here, we demonstrate that single-shot femtosecond SRS (femto-SRS) reaches the maximum speed and sensitivity with preserved chemical resolution by integrating with U-Net. Fresh gastroscopic biopsy is imaged in <60 s, revealing essential histoarchitectural hallmarks perfectly agreed with standard histopathology. Moreover, a diagnostic neural network (CNN) is constructed based on images from 279 patients that predicts gastric cancer with accuracy >96%. We further demonstrate semantic segmentation of intratumor heterogeneity and evaluation of resection margins of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) tissues to simulate rapid and automated intraoperative diagnosis. Our method holds potential for synchronizing gastroscopy and histopathological diagnosis.","Diagnosis of gastric cancer currently requires gastroscopic biopsy, which requires time and expertize to perform. Here, the authors demonstrate a femto-SRS imaging method which showed high accuracy in diagnosing gastric cancer without the need for pathologistbased diagnosis.",2022-07-13
1415,Bromodomain factor 5 is an essential regulator of transcription in Leishmania,"Leishmania are unicellular parasites that cause human and animal diseases. Like other kinetoplastids, they possess large transcriptional start regions (TSRs) which are defined by histone variants and histone lysine acetylation. Cellular interpretation of these chromatin marks is not well understood. Eight bromodomain factors, the reader modules for acetyl-lysine, are found across Leishmania genomes. Using L. mexicana, Cas9-driven gene deletions indicate that BDF1–5 are essential for promastigotes. Dimerisable, split Cre recombinase (DiCre)-inducible gene deletion of BDF5 show it is essential for both promastigotes and murine infection. ChIP-seq identifies BDF5 as enriched at TSRs. XL-BioID proximity proteomics shows the BDF5 landscape is enriched for BDFs, HAT2, proteins involved in transcriptional activity, and RNA processing; revealing a Conserved Regulators of Kinetoplastid Transcription (CRKT) Complex. Inducible deletion of BDF5 causes global reduction in RNA polymerase II transcription. Our results indicate the requirement of Leishmania to interpret histone acetylation marks through the bromodomain-enriched CRKT complex for normal gene expression and cellular viability.","Leishmania use large (5–10 kb) transcriptional start regions, where the chromatin is highly enriched for acetylated histones, to drive the expression of polycistronic gene arrays. Here the authors show bromodomain-containing protein BDF5 is enriched at transcriptional start sites and its depletion leads to cell death in vitro and in murine infections, and they identify its interactors.",2022-07-13
1416,A reference single-cell regulomic and transcriptomic map of cynomolgus monkeys,"Non-human primates are attractive laboratory animal models that accurately reflect both developmental and pathological features of humans. Here we present a compendium of cell types across multiple organs in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) using both single-cell chromatin accessibility and RNA sequencing data. The integrated cell map enables in-depth dissection and comparison of molecular dynamics, cell-type compositions and cellular heterogeneity across multiple tissues and organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data, we infer pseudotime cell trajectories and cell-cell communications to uncover key molecular signatures underlying their cellular processes. Furthermore, we identify various cell-specific cis-regulatory elements and construct organ-specific gene regulatory networks at the single-cell level. Finally, we perform comparative analyses of single-cell landscapes among mouse, monkey and human. We show that cynomolgus monkey has strikingly higher degree of similarities in terms of immune-associated gene expression patterns and cellular communications to human than mouse. Taken together, our study provides a valuable resource for non-human primate cell biology.","Non-human primates are attractive laboratory animal models that can accurately reflect some developmental and pathological features of humans.

1417,Qualitative differences in disease-associated MEK mutants reveal molecular signatures and aberrant signaling-crosstalk in cancer,"Point-mutations of MEK1, a central component of ERK signaling, are present in cancer and RASopathies, but their precise biological effects remain obscure. Here, we report a mutant MEK1 structure that uncovers the mechanisms underlying abnormal activities of cancer- and RASopathy-associated MEK1 mutants. These two classes of MEK1 mutations differentially impact on spatiotemporal dynamics of ERK signaling, cellular transcriptional programs, gene expression profiles, and consequent biological outcomes. By making use of such distinct characteristics of the MEK1 mutants, we identified cancer- and RASopathy-signature genes that may serve as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for these diseases. In particular, two AKT-inhibitor molecules, PHLDA1 and 2, are simultaneously upregulated by oncogenic ERK signaling, and mediate cancer-specific ERK-AKT crosstalk. The combined expression of PHLDA1/2 is critical to confer resistance to ERK pathway-targeted therapeutics on cancer cells. Finally, we propose a therapeutic strategy to overcome this drug resistance. Our data provide vital insights into the etiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic strategy of cancers and RASopathies.","MEK1 mutations are found in cancer and RASopathies, but their effects remain unclear.

1418,Freeze-derived heterogeneous structural color films,"Structural colors have a demonstrated value in constructing various functional materials. Efforts in this area are devoted to developing stratagem for generating heterogeneous structurally colored materials with new architectures and functions. Here, inspired by icing process in nature and ice-templating technologies, we present freeze-derived heterogeneous structural color hydrogels with multiscale structural and functional features. We find that the space-occupying effect of ice crystals is helpful for tuning the distance of non-close-packed colloidal crystal nanoparticles, resulting in corresponding reflection wavelength shifts in the icing area. Thus, by effectively controlling the growth of ice crystals and photo-polymerizing them, structural color hydrogels with the desired structures and morphologies can be customized. Other than traditional monochromatic structure color hydrogels, the resultant hydrogels can be imparted with heterogeneous structured multi-compartment body and multi-color with designed patterns through varying the freezing area design. Based on these features, we have also explored the potential value of these heterotypic structural color hydrogels for information encryptions and decryptions by creating spatiotemporally controlled icing areas. We believe that these inverse ice-template structural color hydrogels will offer new routes for the construction and modulation of next generation smart materials with desired complex architectures.","While most of the structural colored materials only present isotropic colors, limiting their functions and many practical applications, while realizing anisotropic structural color materials remains challenging.

1419,Harnessing many-body spin environment for long coherence storage and high-fidelity single-shot qubit readout,"There is a growing interest in hybrid solid-state quantum systems where nuclear spins, interfaced to the electron spin qubit, are used as quantum memory or qubit register. These approaches require long nuclear spin coherence, which until now seemed impossible owing to the disruptive effect of the electron spin. Here we study InGaAs semiconductor quantum dots, demonstrating millisecond-long collective nuclear spin coherence even under inhomogeneous coupling to the electron central spin. We show that the underlying decoherence mechanism is spectral diffusion induced by a fluctuating electron spin. These results provide new understanding of the many-body coherence in central spin systems, required for development of electron-nuclear spin qubits. As a demonstration, we implement a conditional gate that encodes electron spin state onto collective nuclear spin coherence, and use it for a single-shot readout of the electron spin qubit with >99% fidelity.","Hybrid quantum devices based on coupled nuclear and electron spins offer promising applications, but require long nuclear spin coherence times. Here the authors demonstrate millisecond coherence times for a nuclear spin ensemble coupled to a single electron spin qubit in a semiconductor quantum dot.",2022-07-13
1420,Single cell sequencing identifies clonally expanded synovial CD4+ TPH cells expressing GPR56 in rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease affecting synovial joints where different CD4+ T cell subsets may contribute to pathology. Here, we perform single cell sequencing on synovial CD4+ T cells from anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)+ and ACPA- RA patients and identify two peripheral helper T cell (TPH) states and a cytotoxic CD4+ T cell subset. We show that the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) delineates synovial CXCL13high TPH CD4+ T cells expressing LAG-3 and the tissue-resident memory receptors CXCR6 and CD69. In ACPA- SF, TPH cells display lower levels of GPR56 and LAG-3. Further, most expanded T cell clones in the joint are within CXCL13high TPH CD4+ T cells. Finally, RNA-velocity analyses suggest a common differentiation pathway between the two TPH clusters and effector CD4+ T cells. Our study provides comprehensive immunoprofiling of the synovial CD4+ T cell subsets in ACPA+ and ACPA- RA.",Antibodies against citrullinated proteins (ACPA) can divide rheumatoid arthritis patients but the difference in immune phenotype is not clear.

1421,Integration of tumor extrinsic and intrinsic features associates with immunotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer,"The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) varies greatly among metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Loss of heterozygosity at the HLA-I locus (HLA-LOH) has been identified as an important immune escape mechanism. However, despite HLA-I disruptions in their tumor, many patients have durable ICB responses. Here we seek to identify HLA-I-independent features associated with ICB response in NSCLC. We use single-cell profiling to identify tumor-infiltrating, clonally expanded CD4+ T cells that express a canonical cytotoxic gene program and NSCLC cells with elevated HLA-II expression. We postulate cytotoxic CD4+ T cells mediate anti-tumor activity via HLA-II on tumor cells and augment HLA-I-dependent cytotoxic CD8+ T cell interactions to drive ICB response in NSCLC. We show that integrating tumor extrinsic cytotoxic gene expression with tumor mutational burden is associated with longer time to progression in a real-world cohort of 123 NSCLC patients treated with ICB regimens, including those with HLA-LOH.","Some cancer patients with impaired HLA-I still respond to immunotherapy. Here the authors combine a cytotoxic gene signature from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with tumor mutational burden to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC patients, including those with HLA-LOH.",2022-07-13
1422,Loop-extrusion and polymer phase-separation can co-exist at the single-molecule level to shape chromatin folding,"Loop-extrusion and phase-separation have been proposed as mechanisms that shape chromosome spatial organization. It is unclear, however, how they perform relative to each other in explaining chromatin architecture data and whether they compete or co-exist at the single-molecule level. Here, we compare models of polymer physics based on loop-extrusion and phase-separation, as well as models where both mechanisms act simultaneously in a single molecule, against multiplexed FISH data available in human loci in IMR90 and HCT116 cells. We find that the different models recapitulate bulk Hi-C and average multiplexed microscopy data. Single-molecule chromatin conformations are also well captured, especially by phase-separation based models that better reflect the experimentally reported segregation in globules of the considered genomic loci and their cell-to-cell structural variability. Such a variability is consistent with two main concurrent causes: single-cell epigenetic heterogeneity and an intrinsic thermodynamic conformational degeneracy of folding. Overall, the model combining loop-extrusion and polymer phase-separation provides a very good description of the data, particularly higher-order contacts, showing that the two mechanisms can co-exist in shaping chromatin architecture in single cells.","Two main mechanisms have been proposed to shape 3D genome architecture - loop extrusion and phase separation. Here the authors combine these mechanisms in polymer models in a manner that best fits 3D genome, based on both Hi-C and super-resolution locus imaging data, proposing that these two physical processes can indeed coexist simultaneously within cells to define loops and TADs.",2022-07-13
1423,Scalable multiplex co-fractionation/mass spectrometry platform for accelerated protein interactome discovery,"Co-fractionation/mass spectrometry (CF/MS) enables the mapping of endogenous macromolecular networks on a proteome scale, but current methods are experimentally laborious, resource intensive and afford lesser quantitative accuracy. Here, we present a technically efficient, cost-effective and reproducible multiplex CF/MS (mCF/MS) platform for measuring and comparing, simultaneously, multi-protein assemblies across different experimental samples at a rate that is up to an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches. We apply mCF/MS to map the protein interaction landscape of non-transformed mammary epithelia versus breast cancer cells in parallel, revealing large-scale differences in protein-protein interactions and the relative abundance of associated macromolecules connected with cancer-related pathways and altered cellular processes. The integration of multiplexing capability within an optimized workflow renders mCF/MS as a powerful tool for systematically exploring physical interaction networks in a comparative manner.","Co-fractionation/mass spectrometry (CF/MS) allows mapping protein interactomes but efficiency and quantitative accuracy are limited. Here, the authors develop a reproducible multiplexed CF/MS method and apply it to characterize interactome rewiring in breast cancer cells.",2022-07-13
1424,A visible-light activated secondary phosphine oxide ligand enabling Pd-catalyzed radical cross-couplings,"Although transition metal-catalyzed reactions have evolved with ligand development, ligand design for palladium-catalyzed photoreactions remains less explored. Here, we report a secondary phosphine oxide ligand bearing a visible-light sensitization moiety and apply it to Pd-catalyzed radical cross-coupling reactions. The tautomeric phosphinous acid coordinates to palladium in situ, allowing for pseudo-intramolecular single-electron transfer between the ligand and palladium. Molecular design of the metal complexes aided by time-dependent density functional theory calculations enables the involvement of allyl radicals from π-allyl palladium(II) complexes, and alkyl and aryl radicals from the corresponding halides and palladium(0) complex. This complex enables radical cross-couplings by ligand-to-Pd(II) and Pd(0)-to-ligand single-electron transfer under visible-light irradiation.","Ligand design is key for improving the performance in light-enabled catalytic processes. Here, the authors report the synthesis of a visible-light–activated secondary phosphine oxide ligand and apply it to Pd-catalyzed radical cross-coupling reactions.",2022-07-13
1425,"Central tropical Pacific convection drives extreme high temperatures and surface melt on the Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula","Northern sections of the Larsen Ice Shelf, eastern Antarctic Peninsula (AP) have experienced dramatic break-up and collapse since the early 1990s due to strong summertime surface melt, linked to strengthened circumpolar westerly winds. Here we show that extreme summertime surface melt and record-high temperature events over the eastern AP and Larsen C Ice Shelf are triggered by deep convection in the central tropical Pacific (CPAC), which produces an elongated cyclonic anomaly across the South Pacific coupled with a strong high pressure anomaly over Drake Passage. Together these atmospheric circulation anomalies transport very warm and moist air to the southwest AP, often in the form of “atmospheric rivers”, producing strong foehn warming and surface melt on the eastern AP and Larsen C Ice Shelf. Therefore, variability in CPAC convection, in addition to the circumpolar westerlies, is a key driver of AP surface mass balance and the occurrence of extreme high temperatures.","Landfalling atmospheric rivers on the Antarctic Peninsula, which lead to strong surface melting that can cause ice shelf collapse, have been linked to localized deep convection in the central tropical Pacific northeast of Fiji.",2022-07-13
1426,Model building of protein complexes from intermediate-resolution cryo-EM maps with deep learning-guided automatic assembly,"Advances in microscopy instruments and image processing algorithms have led to an increasing number of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps. However, building accurate models into intermediate-resolution EM maps remains challenging and labor-intensive. Here, we propose an automatic model building method of multi-chain protein complexes from intermediate-resolution cryo-EM maps, named EMBuild, by integrating AlphaFold structure prediction, FFT-based global fitting, domain-based semi-flexible refinement, and graph-based iterative assembling on the main-chain probability map predicted by a deep convolutional network. EMBuild is extensively evaluated on diverse test sets of 47 single-particle EM maps at 4.0–8.0 Å resolution and 16 subtomogram averaging maps of cryo-ET data at 3.7–9.3 Å resolution, and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. We demonstrate that EMBuild is able to build high-quality complex structures that are comparably accurate to the manually built PDB structures from the cryo-EM maps. These results demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of EMBuild in automatic model building.","One challenge in cryo-EM is to build atomic models into intermediate resolution maps. Here, the authors present a deep learning-guided iterative assembling method by integrating AlphaFold, FFTbased fitting, and domain-based refinement.",2022-07-13
1427,Tropical forests as drivers of lake carbon burial,"A significant proportion of carbon (C) captured by terrestrial primary production is buried in lacustrine ecosystems, which have been substantially affected by anthropogenic activities globally. However, there is a scarcity of sedimentary organic carbon (OC) accumulation information for lakes surrounded by highly productive rainforests at warm tropical latitudes, or in response to land cover and climate change. Here, we combine new data from intensive campaigns spanning 13 lakes across remote Amazonian regions with a broad literature compilation, to produce the first spatially-weighted global analysis of recent OC burial in lakes (over ~50-100-years) that integrates both biome type and forest cover. We find that humid tropical forest lake sediments are a disproportionately important global OC sink of ~80 Tg C yr−1 with implications for climate change. Further, we demonstrate that temperature and forest conservation are key factors in maintaining massive organic carbon pools in tropical lacustrine sediments.","Tropical forest lake sediments are global carbon sinks, representing an important implication for climate change, of which both temperature and forest conservation are key factors in maintaining the carbon burial mechanism in lacustrine ecosystems.",2022-07-13
1428,Human-type sialic acid receptors contribute to avian influenza A virus binding and entry by hetero-multivalent interactions,"Establishment of zoonotic viruses, causing pandemics like the Spanish flu and Covid-19, requires adaptation to human receptors. Pandemic influenza A viruses (IAV) that crossed the avian-human species barrier switched from binding avian-type α2-3-linked sialic acid (2-3Sia) to human-type 2-6Sia receptors. Here, we show that this specificity switch is however less dichotomous as generally assumed. Binding and entry specificity were compared using mixed synthetic glycan gradients of 2-3Sia and 2-6Sia and by employing a genetically remodeled Sia repertoire on the surface of a Sia-free cell line and on a sialoglycoprotein secreted from these cells. Expression of a range of (mixed) 2-3Sia and 2-6Sia densities shows that non-binding human-type receptors efficiently enhanced avian IAV binding and entry provided the presence of a low density of high affinity avian-type receptors, and vice versa. Considering the heterogeneity of sialoglycan receptors encountered in vivo, hetero-multivalent binding is physiologically relevant and will impact evolutionary pathways leading to host adaptation.","It is believed that human Influenza HA glycoprotein attaches to alpha2-6 linked sialic acids (SA) on cells, while avian viruses bind to alpha2-3 linked sialic acids, therewith contributing to host tropism. Here, Liu et al. show that mixing low-affinity alpha2-3 SA with low amounts of high-affinity alpha2-6 SA increases binding and entry of human viruses and the converse for avian virus. This shows that receptor recognition is not as strict as currently assumed and provides evidence that heteromultivalent interactions between human/avian HA and SA contributes to host adaptation.",2022-07-13
1429,Selective expression of variant surface antigens enables Plasmodium falciparum to evade immune clearance in vivo,"Plasmodium falciparum has developed extensive mechanisms to evade host immune clearance. Currently, most of our understanding is based on in vitro studies of individual parasite variant surface antigens and how this relates to the processes in vivo is not well-understood. Here, we have used a humanized mouse model to identify parasite factors important for in vivo growth. We show that upregulation of the specific PfEMP1, VAR2CSA, provides the parasite with protection from macrophage phagocytosis and clearance in the humanized mice. Furthermore, parasites adapted to thrive in the humanized mice show reduced NK cell-mediated killing through interaction with the immune inhibitory receptor, LILRB1. Taken together, these findings reveal new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms that the parasite utilizes to coordinate immune escape in vivo. Identification and targeting of these specific parasite variant surface antigens crucial for immune evasion provides a unique approach for therapy.","During the erythrocyte (RBC) stage of P. falciparum infection variant surface antigens (VSAs) such as PfEMP1s and RIFINs expressed on RBCs are important for infection and evasion of host innate immune system. Here, Chew et al. use a NSG mouse model, which is deficient in B, T and NK cells but retains macrophages, to show that PfEMP1 surface expression is required for in vivo adaptation as well as in vitro evasion of macrophage phagocytosis.",2022-07-13
1430,Massively targeted evaluation of therapeutic CRISPR off-targets in cells,"Methods for sensitive and high-throughput evaluation of CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs) off-targets (OTs) are essential for advancing RGN-based gene therapies. Here we report SURRO-seq for simultaneously evaluating thousands of therapeutic RGN OTs in cells. SURRO-seq captures RGN-induced indels in cells by pooled lentiviral OTs libraries and deep sequencing, an approach comparable and complementary to OTs detection by T7 endonuclease 1, GUIDE-seq, and CIRCLE-seq. Application of SURRO-seq to 8150 OTs from 110 therapeutic RGNs identifies significantly detectable indels in 783 OTs, of which 37 OTs are found in cancer genes and 23 OTs are further validated in five human cell lines by targeted amplicon sequencing. Finally, SURRO-seq reveals that thermodynamically stable wobble base pair (rG•dT) and free binding energy strongly affect RGN specificity. Our study emphasizes the necessity of thoroughly evaluating therapeutic RGN OTs to minimize inevitable off-target effects.",Thorough evaluation of CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases off-targets in cells is required for advancing gene therapies.

1431,De-etiolation-induced protein 1 (DEIP1) mediates assembly of the cytochrome b6f complex in Arabidopsis,"The conversion of light energy to chemical energy by photosynthesis requires the concerted action of large protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane. Recent work has provided fundamental insights into the three-dimensional structure of these complexes, but how they are assembled from hundreds of parts remains poorly understood. Particularly little is known about the biogenesis of the cytochrome b6f complex (Cytb6f), the redox-coupling complex that interconnects the two photosystems. Here we report the identification of a factor that guides the assembly of Cytb6f in thylakoids of chloroplasts. The protein, DE-ETIOLATION-INDUCED PROTEIN 1 (DEIP1), resides in the thylakoid membrane and is essential for photoautotrophic growth. Knock-out mutants show a specific loss of Cytb6f, and are defective in complex assembly. We demonstrate that DEIP1 interacts with the two cytochrome subunits of the complex, PetA and PetB, and mediates the assembly of intermediates in Cytb6f biogenesis. The identification of DEIP1 provides an entry point into the study of the assembly pathway of a crucial complex in photosynthetic electron transfer.","The Cytb6f complex is a multi-subunit enzyme that couples the two photosystems during the light reactions of photosynthesis. Here the authors show that the thylakoid-localized DEIP1 protein interacts with the PetA and PetB subunits, and is essential for Cytb6f complex assembly in Arabidopsis.",2022-07-13
1432,The HHIP-AS1 lncRNA promotes tumorigenicity through stabilization of dynein complex 1 in human SHH-driven tumors,"Most lncRNAs display species-specific expression patterns suggesting that animal models of cancer may only incompletely recapitulate the regulatory crosstalk between lncRNAs and oncogenic pathways in humans. Among these pathways, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling is aberrantly activated in several human cancer entities. We unravel that aberrant expression of the primate-specific lncRNA HedgeHog Interacting Protein-AntiSense 1 (HHIP-AS1) is a hallmark of SHH-driven tumors including medulloblastoma and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors. HHIP-AS1 is actively transcribed from a bidirectional promoter shared with SHH regulator HHIP. Knockdown of HHIP-AS1 induces mitotic spindle deregulation impairing tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HHIP-AS1 binds directly to the mRNA of cytoplasmic dynein 1 intermediate chain 2 (DYNC1I2) and attenuates its degradation by hsa-miR-425-5p. We uncover that neither HHIP-AS1 nor the corresponding regulatory element in DYNC1I2 are evolutionary conserved in mice. Taken together, we discover an lncRNA-mediated mechanism that enables the pro-mitotic effects of SHH pathway activation in human tumors.","Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can contribute to cancers that are driven by Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling. Here the authors report that lncRNA HHIP-AS1 stabilises the mRNA of dynein complex 1, thereby, promoting the pro-mitotic effects of SHH-driven tumors.",2022-07-13
1433,Genomic epidemiology of Delta SARS-CoV-2 during transition from elimination to suppression in Aotearoa New Zealand,"New Zealand’s COVID-19 elimination strategy heavily relied on the use of genomics to inform contact tracing, linking cases to the border and to clusters during community outbreaks. In August 2021, New Zealand entered its second nationwide lockdown after the detection of a single community case with no immediately apparent epidemiological link to the border. This incursion resulted in the largest outbreak seen in New Zealand caused by the Delta Variant of Concern. Here we generated 3806 high quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cases reported in New Zealand between 17 August and 1 December 2021, representing 43% of reported cases. We detected wide geographical spread coupled with undetected community transmission, characterised by the apparent extinction and reappearance of genomically linked clusters. We also identified the emergence, and near replacement, of genomes possessing a 10-nucleotide frameshift deletion that caused the likely truncation of accessory protein ORF7a. By early October, New Zealand moved from an elimination strategy to a suppression strategy and the role of genomics changed markedly from being used to track and trace, towards population-level surveillance.","Aotearoa New Zealand pursued a COVID-19 elimination strategy until October 2021 when it moved to a suppression strategy. In this genomic surveillance study, the authors describe spread of the virus during the transition between these strategies, with evidence of substantial undetected community transmission.",2022-07-12
1434,Anisotropic magnon damping by zero-temperature quantum fluctuations in ferromagnetic CrGeTe3,"Spin and lattice are two fundamental degrees of freedom in a solid, and their fluctuations about the equilibrium values in a magnetic ordered crystalline lattice form quasiparticles termed magnons (spin waves) and phonons (lattice waves), respectively. In most materials with strong spin-lattice coupling (SLC), the interaction of spin and lattice induces energy gaps in the spin wave dispersion at the nominal intersections of magnon and phonon modes. Here we use neutron scattering to show that in the two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals honeycomb lattice ferromagnetic CrGeTe3, spin waves propagating within the 2D plane exhibit an anomalous dispersion, damping, and breakdown of quasiparticle conservation, while magnons along the c axis behave as expected for a local moment ferromagnet. These results indicate the presence of dynamical SLC arising from the zero-temperature quantum fluctuations in CrGeTe3, suggesting that the observed in-plane spin waves are mixed spin and lattice quasiparticles fundamentally different from pure magnons and phonons.","CrGeTe3 is a van der Waals honeycomb ferromagnet, known for exhibiting strong coupling between lattice and spin degrees of freedom. Here, Chen et al perform neutron scattering on CrGeTe3, find a broadened spin-wave excitation resulting from zero-temperature motion of the atoms in the lattice.",2022-07-12
1435,CD8 lymphocytes mitigate HIV-1 persistence in lymph node follicular helper T cells during hyperacute-treated infection,"HIV persistence in tissue sites despite ART is a major barrier to HIV cure. Detailed studies of HIV-infected cells and immune responses in native lymph node tissue environment is critical for gaining insight into immune mechanisms impacting HIV persistence and clearance in tissue sanctuary sites. We compared HIV persistence and HIV-specific T cell responses in lymph node biopsies obtained from 14 individuals who initiated therapy in Fiebig stages I/II, 5 persons treated in Fiebig stages III-V and 17 late treated individuals who initiated ART in Fiebig VI and beyond. Using multicolor immunofluorescence staining and in situ hybridization, we detect HIV RNA and/or protein in 12 of 14 Fiebig I/II treated persons on suppressive therapy for 1 to 55 months, and in late treated persons with persistent antigens. CXCR3+ T follicular helper cells harbor the greatest amounts of gag mRNA transcripts. Notably, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells responses are associated with lower HIV antigen burden, suggesting that these responses may contribute to HIV suppression in lymph nodes during therapy. These results reveal HIV persistence despite the initiation of ART in hyperacute infection and highlight the contribution of virus-specific responses to HIV suppression in tissue sanctuaries during suppressive ART.","Despite antiretroviral therapy, HIV often persists in tissue sanctuary sites. In this work, authors investigate HIV persistence and T cell responses in lymph node biopsies obtained from individuals who initiated antiretroviral therapy in Fiebig stage I and beyond.",2022-07-12
1436,An LNA-amide modification that enhances the cell uptake and activity of phosphorothioate exon-skipping oligonucleotides,"Oligonucleotides that target mRNA have great promise as therapeutic agents for life-threatening conditions but suffer from poor bioavailability, hence high cost. As currently untreatable diseases come within the reach of oligonucleotide therapies, new analogues are urgently needed to address this. With this in mind we describe reduced-charge oligonucleotides containing artificial LNA-amide linkages with improved gymnotic cell uptake, RNA affinity, stability and potency. To construct such oligonucleotides, five LNA-amide monomers (A, T, C, 5mC and G), where the 3′-OH is replaced by an ethanoic acid group, are synthesised in good yield and used in solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis to form amide linkages with high efficiency. The artificial backbone causes minimal structural deviation to the DNA:RNA duplex. These studies indicate that splice-switching oligonucleotides containing LNA-amide linkages and phosphorothioates display improved activity relative to oligonucleotides lacking amides, highlighting the therapeutic potential of this technology.","Oligonucleotides targeting mRNA are promising therapeutic agents but suffer from poor bioavailability. Here, the authors develop reduced-charge oligonucleotides with artificial LNA-amide linkages with improved cell uptake and minimal structural deviation to the DNA:RNA duplex.",2022-07-12
1437,A randomized phase 3 trial of Gemcitabine or Nab-paclitaxel combined with cisPlatin as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer,"Platinum is recommended in combination with gemcitabine in the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). We conduct a randomized phase 3, controlled, open-label trial to compare nab-paclitaxel/cisplatin (AP) with gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) in mTNBC patients (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02546934). 254 patients with untreated mTNBC randomly receive AP (nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m² on day 1, 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m² on day 1) or GP (gemcitabine 1250 mg/m² on day 1, 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m² on day 1) intravenously every 3 weeks until progression disease, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints are objective response rate (ORR), safety and overall survival (OS). The trial has met pre-specified endpoints. The median PFS is 9.8 months with AP as compared to 7.4 months with GP (stratified HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50–0.88; P = 0.004). AP significantly increases ORR (81.1% vs. 56.3%, P < 0.001) and prolongs OS (stratified HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44–0.90; P = 0.010) to GP. Of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, a significantly higher incidence of neuropathy in AP and thrombocytopenia in GP is noted. These findings warrant further assessment of adding novel agents to the nab-paclitaxel/platinum backbone due to its high potency for patients with mTNBC.","Platinum agents, such as carboplatin and cisplatin, have been recommended in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

1438,"Deciphering polymorphism in 61,157 Escherichia coli genomes via epistatic sequence landscapes","Characterizing the effect of mutations is key to understand the evolution of protein sequences and to separate neutral amino-acid changes from deleterious ones. Epistatic interactions between residues can lead to a context dependence of mutation effects. Context dependence constrains the amino-acid changes that can contribute to polymorphism in the short term, and the ones that can accumulate between species in the long term. We use computational approaches to accurately predict the polymorphisms segregating in a panel of 61,157 Escherichia coli genomes from the analysis of distant homologues. By comparing a context-aware Direct-Coupling Analysis modelling to a non-epistatic approach, we show that the genetic context strongly constrains the tolerable amino acids in 30% to 50% of amino-acid sites. The study of more distant species suggests the gradual build-up of genetic context over long evolutionary timescales by the accumulation of small epistatic contributions.","Predicting the effects of mutations in a species is a major challenge in genetics. Here, the authors investigate protein sequence landscapes using diverged E. coli sequences, to predict tolerated mutations and capture interactions between mutations.",2022-07-12
1439,Precision cancer sono-immunotherapy using deep-tissue activatable semiconducting polymer immunomodulatory nanoparticles,"Nanomedicine holds promise to enhance cancer immunotherapy; however, its potential to elicit highly specific anti-tumor immunity without compromising immune tolerance has yet to be fully unlocked. This study develops deep-tissue activatable cancer sono-immunotherapy based on the discovery of a semiconducting polymer that generates sonodynamic singlet oxygen (1O2) substantially higher than other sonosensitizers. Conjugation of two immunomodulators via 1O2-cleavable linkers onto this polymer affords semiconducting polymer immunomodulatory nanoparticles (SPINs) whose immunotherapeutic actions are largely inhibited. Under ultrasound irradiation, SPINs generate 1O2 not only to directly debulk tumors and reprogram tumor microenvironment to enhance tumor immunogenicity, but also to remotely release the immunomodulators specifically at tumor site. Such a precision sono-immunotherapy eliminates tumors and prevents relapse in pancreatic mouse tumor model. SPINs show effective antitumor efficacy even in a rabbit tumor model. Moreover, the sonodynamic activation of SPINs confines immunotherapeutic action primarily to tumors, reducing the sign of immune-related adverse events.","To improve the specificity of immunotherapy, here the authors report the design of a semiconducting polymer immunomodulatory nanoparticle with sonodynamic process to remotely release immune-modulators for deep-tissue precision cancer sono-immunotherapy.",2022-07-12
1440,Malaria parasite heme biosynthesis promotes and griseofulvin protects against cerebral malaria in mice,"Heme-biosynthetic pathway of malaria parasite is dispensable for asexual stages, but essential for mosquito and liver stages. Despite having backup mechanisms to acquire hemoglobin-heme, pathway intermediates and/or enzymes from the host, asexual parasites express heme pathway enzymes and synthesize heme. Here we show heme synthesized in asexual stages promotes cerebral pathogenesis by enhancing hemozoin formation. Hemozoin is a parasite molecule associated with inflammation, aberrant host-immune responses, disease severity and cerebral pathogenesis. The heme pathway knockout parasites synthesize less hemozoin, and mice infected with knockout parasites are protected from cerebral malaria and death due to anemia is delayed. Biosynthetic heme regulates food vacuole integrity and the food vacuoles from knockout parasites are compromised in pH, lipid unsaturation and proteins, essential for hemozoin formation. Targeting parasite heme synthesis by griseofulvin—a FDA-approved antifungal drug, prevents cerebral malaria in mice and provides an adjunct therapeutic option for cerebral and severe malaria.","Malaria parasite heme pathway is non-essential for blood stages, but essential for mosquito and liver stages. Here, the authors show that heme pathway promotes cerebral pathogenesis by enhancing hemozoin formation and that targeting it with griseofulvin inhibits cerebral malaria in mice.",2022-07-12
1441,Genome-wide signatures of synergistic epistasis during parallel adaptation in a Baltic Sea copepod,"The role of epistasis in driving adaptation has remained an unresolved problem dating back to the Evolutionary Synthesis. In particular, whether epistatic interactions among genes could promote parallel evolution remains unexplored. To address this problem, we employ an Evolve and Resequence (E&R) experiment, using the copepod Eurytemora affinis, to elucidate the evolutionary genomic response to rapid salinity decline. Rapid declines in coastal salinity at high latitudes are a predicted consequence of global climate change. Based on time-resolved pooled whole-genome sequencing, we uncover a remarkably parallel, polygenic response across ten replicate selection lines, with 79.4% of selected alleles shared between lines by the tenth generation of natural selection. Using extensive computer simulations of our experiment conditions, we find that this polygenic parallelism is consistent with positive synergistic epistasis among alleles, far more so than other mechanisms tested. Our study provides experimental and theoretical support for a novel mechanism promoting repeatable polygenic adaptation, a phenomenon that may be common for selection on complex physiological traits.","Using time-series whole-genome sequencing data from a laboratory evolution experiment, along with extensive computer simulations, the authors show that synergistic epistasis could drive rapid parallel freshwater adaptation in a saline copepod.",2022-07-12
1442,Exploration of glassy state in Prussian blue analogues,"Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are archetypes of microporous coordination polymers/metal–organic frameworks whose versatile composition allows for diverse functionalities. However, developments in PBAs have centred solely on their crystalline state, and the glassy state of PBAs has not been explored. Here we describe the preparation of the glassy state of PBAs via a mechanically induced crystal-to-glass transformation and explore their properties. The preservation of short-range metal–ligand–metal connectivity is confirmed, enabling the framework-based functionality and semiconductivity in the glass. The transformation also generates unconventional CN− vacancies, followed by the reduction of metal sites. This leads to significant porosity enhancement in recrystallised PBA, enabled by further accessibility of isolated micropores. Finally, mechanical stability under stress for successful vitrification is correlated to defect contents and interstitial water. Our results demonstrate how mechanochemistry provides opportunities to explore glassy states of molecular framework materials in which the stable liquid state is absent.","Developments in Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have centred solely on their crystalline state.

1443,Base editing in human cells with monomeric DddA-TALE fusion deaminases,"Inter-bacterial toxin DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs) enable targeted C-to-T conversions in nuclear and organellar DNA. DddAtox, the deaminase catalytic domain derived from Burkholderia cenocepacia, is split into two inactive halves to avoid its cytotoxicity in eukaryotic cells, when fused to transcription activator-like effector (TALE) DNA-binding proteins to make DdCBEs. As a result, DdCBEs function as pairs, which hampers gene delivery via viral vectors with a small cargo size. Here, we present non-toxic, full-length DddAtox variants to make monomeric DdCBEs (mDdCBEs), enabling mitochondrial DNA editing with high efficiencies of up to 50%, when transiently expressed in human cells. We demonstrate that mDdCBEs expressed via AAV in cultured human cells can achieve nearly homoplasmic C-to-T editing in mitochondrial DNA. Interestingly, mDdCBEs often produce mutation patterns different from those obtained with conventional dimeric DdCBEs. Furthermore, mDdCBEs allow base editing at sites for which only one TALE protein can be designed. We also show that transfection of mDdCBE-encoding mRNA, rather than plasmid, can reduce off-target editing in human mitochondrial DNA.","Monomeric DdCBEs (mDdCBEs), enabling mitochondrial DNA editing with high efficiencies of up to 50%, when transiently expressed in cultured human cells and nearly homoplasmic C-to-T editing via AAV.",2022-07-12
1444,Cluster-type analogue memristor by engineering redox dynamics for high-performance neuromorphic computing,"Memristors, or memristive devices, have attracted tremendous interest in neuromorphic hardware implementation. However, the high electric-field dependence in conventional filamentary memristors results in either digital-like conductance updates or gradual switching only in a limited dynamic range. Here, we address the switching parameter, the reduction probability of Ag cations in the switching medium, and ultimately demonstrate a cluster-type analogue memristor. Ti nanoclusters are embedded into densified amorphous Si for the following reasons: low standard reduction potential, thermodynamic miscibility with Si, and alloy formation with Ag. These Ti clusters effectively induce the electrochemical reduction activity of Ag cations and allow linear potentiation/depression in tandem with a large conductance range (~244) and long data retention (~99% at 1 hour). Moreover, according to the reduction potentials of incorporated metals (Pt, Ta, W, and Ti), the extent of linearity improvement is selectively tuneable. Image processing simulation proves that the Ti4.8%:a-Si device can fully function with high accuracy as an ideal synaptic model.","Conventional filamentary memristors are limited in dynamics by the high electric-field dependence of the conductive filament. Here, Jeong et al. presents a method which creates a cluster-type memristor, enabling large conductance range and long data retention.",2022-07-12

Here we investigate membranes made from multilayer graphdiyne, a graphene-like crystal with a larger unit cell. Despite being nearly a hundred of nanometers thick, the membranes allow fast, Knudsen-type permeation of light gases such as helium and hydrogen whereas heavy noble gases like xenon exhibit strongly suppressed flows. Using isotope and cryogenic temperature measurements, the seemingly conflicting characteristics are explained by a high density of straight-through holes (direct porosity of ∼0.1%), in which heavy atoms are adsorbed on the walls, partially blocking Knudsen flows. Our work offers important insights into intricate transport mechanisms playing a role at nanoscale.","2D nanoporous membranes are predicted to provide highly selective gas transport in combination with extreme permeance.

We describe herein a highly sensitive and selective molecule amplification technology - superRCA assays - for rapid and highly specific detection of DNA sequence variants present at very low frequencies in DNA samples. Using a standard flow cytometer we demonstrate precise, ultra-sensitive detection of single-nucleotide mutant sequences from malignant cells against up to a 100,000-fold excess of DNA from normal cells in either bone marrow or peripheral blood, to follow the course of patients treated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We also demonstrate that sequence variants located in a high-GC region may be sensitively detected, and we illustrate the potential of the technology for early detection of disease recurrence as a basis for prompt change of therapy.","Rare tumour specific mutations in patient samples act as markers to monitor the course of disease. Here the authors report superRCA assays for rapid, highly specific detection of DNA sequence variants present at very low frequencies in DNA samples with flow cytometry readout; they use this on AML patients.",2022-07-12
1447,Trypsin is a coordinate regulator of N and P nutrients in marine phytoplankton,"Trypsin is best known as a digestive enzyme in animals, but remains unexplored in phytoplankton, the major primary producers in the ocean. Here we report the prevalence of trypsin genes in global ocean phytoplankton and significant influences of environmental nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) on their expression. Using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated-knockout and overexpression analyses, we further reveal that a trypsin in Phaeodactylum tricornutum (PtTryp2) functions to repress N acquisition, but its expression decreases under N-deficiency to promote N acquisition. On the contrary, PtTryp2 promotes phosphate uptake per se, and its expression increases under P-deficiency to further reinforce P acquisition. Furthermore, PtTryp2 knockout led to amplitude magnification of the nitrate and phosphate uptake ‘seesaw’, whereas PtTryp2 overexpression dampened it, linking PtTryp2 to stabilizing N:P stoichiometry. Our data demonstrate that PtTryp2 is a coordinate regulator of N:P stoichiometric homeostasis. The study opens a window for deciphering how phytoplankton adapt to nutrient-variable marine environments.","Using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated-knockout and overexpression analyses, this study shows that a trypsin in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum promotes phosphorus uptake and inhibits nitrogen uptake but its expression is downregulated under nitrogen stress and upregulated under phosphorus stress. Together, the findings suggest this trypsin is a coordinate regulator of nutrient homeostasis.",2022-07-12
1448,Early crustal processes revealed by the ejection site of the oldest martian meteorite,"The formation and differentiation of the crust of Mars in the first tens of millions of years after its accretion can only be deciphered from incredibly limited records. The martian breccia NWA 7034 and its paired stones is one of them. This meteorite contains the oldest martian igneous material ever dated: ~4.5 Ga old. However, its source and geological context have so far remained unknown. Here, we show that the meteorite was ejected 5–10 Ma ago from the north-east of the Terra Cimmeria—Sirenum province, in the southern hemisphere of Mars. More specifically, the breccia belongs to the ejecta deposits of the Khujirt crater formed 1.5 Ga ago, and it was ejected as a result of the formation of the Karratha crater 5–10 Ma ago. Our findings demonstrate that the Terra Cimmeria—Sirenum province is a relic of the differentiated primordial martian crust, formed shortly after the accretion of the planet, and that it constitutes a unique record of early crustal processes. This province is an ideal landing site for future missions aiming to unravel the first tens of millions of years of the history of Mars and, by extension, of all terrestrial planets, including the Earth.",A new study pinpoints the ejection site of the 4.5-Ga-old Martian breccia NWA 7034 and paired stones to an area northeast of the Terra 679 Cimmeria–Sirenium province.,2022-07-12
1449,Self-assembly of tessellated tissue sheets by expansion and collision,"Tissues do not exist in isolation—they interact with other tissues within and across organs. While cell-cell interactions have been intensely investigated, less is known about tissue-tissue interactions. Here, we studied collisions between monolayer tissues with different geometries, cell densities, and cell types. First, we determine rules for tissue shape changes during binary collisions and describe complex cell migration at tri-tissue boundaries. Next, we propose that genetically identical tissues displace each other based on pressure gradients, which are directly linked to gradients in cell density. We present a physical model of tissue interactions that allows us to estimate the bulk modulus of the tissues from collision dynamics. Finally, we introduce TissEllate, a design tool for self-assembling complex tessellations from arrays of many tissues, and we use cell sheet engineering techniques to transfer these composite tissues like cellular films. Overall, our work provides insight into the mechanics of tissue collisions, harnessing them to engineer tissue composites as designable living materials.","Tissue boundaries in our body separate organs and enable healing, but boundary mechanics are not well known. Here, the authors define mechanical rules for colliding cell monolayers and use these rules to make complex, predictable tessellations.",2022-07-12
1450,Cumulative cultural evolution and mechanisms for cultural selection in wild bird songs,"Cumulative cultural evolution, the accumulation of sequential changes within a single socially learned behaviour that results in improved function, is prominent in humans and has been documented in experimental studies of captive animals and managed wild populations. Here, we provide evidence that cumulative cultural evolution has occurred in the learned songs of Savannah sparrows. In a first step, “click trains” replaced “high note clusters” over a period of three decades. We use mathematical modelling to show that this replacement is consistent with the action of selection, rather than drift or frequency-dependent bias. Generations later, young birds elaborated the “click train” song form by adding more clicks. We show that the new songs with more clicks elicit stronger behavioural responses from both males and females. Therefore, we suggest that a combination of social learning, innovation, and sexual selection favoring a specific discrete trait was followed by directional sexual selection that resulted in naturally occurring cumulative cultural evolution in the songs of this wild animal population.","Cumulative cultural evolution is ubiquitous in humans, but is rarely observed in non-human animals. Here, Williams et al. report elaboration of songs over several decades in Savannah sparrows, consistent with cumulative cultural evolution.",2022-07-11
1451,Single-cell analysis highlights differences in druggable pathways underlying adaptive or fibrotic kidney regeneration,"The kidney has tremendous capacity to repair after acute injury, however, pathways guiding adaptive and fibrotic repair are poorly understood. We developed a model of adaptive and fibrotic kidney regeneration by titrating ischemic injury dose. We performed detailed biochemical and histological analysis and profiled transcriptomic changes at bulk and single-cell level (> 110,000 cells) over time. Our analysis highlights kidney proximal tubule cells as key susceptible cells to injury. Adaptive proximal tubule repair correlated with fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. We identify a specific maladaptive/profibrotic proximal tubule cluster after long ischemia, which expresses proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines and myeloid cell chemotactic factors. Druggability analysis highlights pyroptosis/ferroptosis as vulnerable pathways in these profibrotic cells. Pharmacological targeting of pyroptosis/ferroptosis in vivo pushed cells towards adaptive repair and ameliorates fibrosis. In summary, our single-cell analysis defines key differences in adaptive and fibrotic repair and identifies druggable pathways for pharmacological intervention to prevent kidney fibrosis.","After acute injury, kidneys either successfully repair/regenerate or become fibrotic. Here the authors use scRNA-seq to study adaptive/maladaptive kidney regeneration and identify proinflammatory/fibrotic proximal tubule cells with pharmacologically targetable pyroptosis/ferroptosis signatures.",2022-07-11
1452,Relativistic Bohmian trajectories of photons via weak measurements,"Bohmian mechanics is a nonlocal hidden-variable interpretation of quantum theory which predicts that particles follow deterministic trajectories in spacetime. Historically, the study of Bohmian trajectories has mainly been restricted to nonrelativistic regimes due to the widely held belief that the theory is incompatible with special relativity. Here, we present an approach for constructing the relativistic Bohmian-type velocity field of single particles. The advantage of our proposal is that it is operational in nature, grounded in weak measurements of the particle’s momentum and energy. We apply our weak measurement formalism to obtain the relativistic spacetime trajectories of photons in a Michelson–Sagnac interferometer. The trajectories satisfy quantum-mechanical continuity and the relativistic velocity addition rule. We propose a modified Alcubierre metric which could give rise to these trajectories within the paradigm of general relativity.","Making Bohmian mechanics fully compatible with special relativity is still an ongoing challenge. Here, the authors make a further step in this direction by providing a way of constructing the relativistic Bohmian-type velocity field of single photons which is operationally based on weak measurements.",2022-07-11
1453,Enhancing fibre-optic distributed acoustic sensing capabilities with blind near-field array signal processing,"Distributed acoustic sensors (DAS) can monitor mechanical vibrations along thousands independent locations using an optical fibre. The measured acoustic waveform highly varies along the sensing fibre due to the intrinsic uneven DAS longitudinal response and distortions originated during mechanical wave propagation. Here, we propose a fully blind method based on near-field acoustic array processing that considers the nonuniform response of DAS channels and can be used with any optical fibre positioning geometry having angular diversity. With no source and fibre location information, the method can reduce signal distortions and provide relevant signal-to-noise ratio enhancement through sparse beamforming spatial filtering. The method also allows the localisation of the two-dimensional spatial coordinates of acoustic sources, requiring no specific fibre installation design. The method offers distributed analysis capabilities of the entire acoustic field outside the sensing fibre, enabling DAS systems to characterise vibration sources placed in areas far from the optical fibre.","Here, the authors demonstrate a blind and sparse near-field array signal processing approach to enhance the measurement quality of fibre-optic distributed acoustic sensors. It further enables the accurate estimation of the spatial coordinates of acoustic sources.",2022-07-11
1454,Chiral self-sorting and guest recognition of porous aromatic cages,"The synthesis of ultra-stable chiral porous organic cages (POCs) and their controllable chiral self-sorting at the molecular and supramolecular level remains challening. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a serial of axially chiral porous aromatic cages (PAC 1-S and 1-R) with high chemical stability. The theoretical and experimental studies on the chiral self-sorting reveal that the exclusive self-recognition on cage formation is an enthalpy-driven process while the chiral narcissistic and self-sorting on supramolecular assembly of racemic cages can be precisely regulated by π–π and C–H…π interactions from different solvents. Regarding the chemical stability, the crystallinity of PAC 1 is maintained in aqueous solvents, such as boiling water, high-concentrated acid and alkali; mixtures of solvents, such as 1 M H2SO4/MeOH/H2O solution, are also tolerated. Investigations on the chiral sensing performance show that PAC 1 enables enantioselective recognition of axially chiral biaryl molecules.","The synthesis of stable chiral porous organic cages and the study of their chiral self-sorting properties is challenging. Here, the authors report axially chiral porous aromatic cages with high stability and solvent-controlled chiral self-sorting.",2022-07-11
1455,Blocking glycine utilization inhibits multiple myeloma progression by disrupting glutathione balance,"Metabolites in the tumor microenvironment are a critical factor for tumor progression. However, the lack of knowledge about the metabolic profile in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment of multiple myeloma (MM) limits our understanding of MM progression. Here, we show that the glycine concentration in the BM microenvironment is elevated due to bone collagen degradation mediated by MM cell-secreted matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13), while the elevated glycine level is linked to MM progression. MM cells utilize the channel protein solute carrier family 6 member 9 (SLC6A9) to absorb extrinsic glycine subsequently involved in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH) and purines. Inhibiting glycine utilization via SLC6A9 knockdown or the treatment with betaine suppresses MM cell proliferation and enhances the effects of bortezomib on MM cells. Together, we identify glycine as a key metabolic regulator of MM, unveil molecular mechanisms governing MM progression, and provide a promising therapeutic strategy for MM treatment.","The bone tumour microenvironment plays an essential role in multiple myeloma (MM) development. Here, the authors show that bone collagen degradation provides glycine to support MM progression through glutathione and purine synthesis.",2022-07-11
1456,Translational fidelity and growth of Arabidopsis require stress-sensitive diphthamide biosynthesis,"Diphthamide, a post-translationally modified histidine residue of eukaryotic TRANSLATION ELONGATION FACTOR2 (eEF2), is the human host cell-sensitizing target of diphtheria toxin. Diphthamide biosynthesis depends on the 4Fe-4S-cluster protein Dph1 catalyzing the first committed step, as well as Dph2 to Dph7, in yeast and mammals. Here we show that diphthamide modification of eEF2 is conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana and requires AtDPH1. Ribosomal −1 frameshifting-error rates are increased in Arabidopsis dph1 mutants, similar to yeast and mice. Compared to the wild type, shorter roots and smaller rosettes of dph1 mutants result from fewer formed cells. TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase activity is attenuated, and autophagy is activated, in dph1 mutants. Under abiotic stress diphthamide-unmodified eEF2 accumulates in wild-type seedlings, most strongly upon heavy metal excess, which is conserved in human cells. In summary, our results suggest that diphthamide contributes to the functionality of the translational machinery monitored by plants to regulate growth.",Diphthamide is a post-translationally modified histidine residue present in animal and yeast TRANSLATION ELONGATION FACTOR2.

1457,Angstrom-confined catalytic water purification within Co-TiOx laminar membrane nanochannels,"The freshwater scarcity and inadequate access to clean water globally have rallied tremendous efforts in developing robust technologies for water purification and decontamination, and heterogeneous catalysis is a highly-promising solution. Sub-nanometer-confined reaction is the ultimate frontier of catalytic chemistry, yet it is challenging to form the angstrom channels with distributed atomic catalytic centers within, and to match the internal mass transfer and the reactive species’ lifetimes. Here, we resolve these issues by applying the concept of the angstrom-confined catalytic water contaminant degradation to achieve unprecedented reaction rates within 4.6 Å channels of two-dimensional laminate membrane assembled from monolayer cobalt-doped titanium oxide nanosheets. The demonstrated degradation rate constant of the target pollutant ranitidine (1.06 ms−1) is 5–7 orders of magnitude faster compared with the state-of-the-art, achieving the 100% degradation over 100 h continuous operation. This approach is also ~100% effective against diverse water contaminates with a retention time of <30 ms, and the strategy developed can be also extended to other two-dimensional material-assembled membranes. This work paves the way towards the generic angstrom-confined catalysis and unravels the importance of utilizing angstrom-confinement strategy in the design of efficient catalysts for water purification.","Subnanometer-confined reaction is the frontier of catalytic chemistry, yet it is challenging to form the angstrom channels with distributed atomic catalytic centers within, and to match the internal mass transfer and the reactive species’ lifetimes.

1458,Regulation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR condensation and nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning,"Auxin critically regulates plant growth and development. Auxin-driven transcriptional responses are mediated through the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) family of transcription factors. ARF protein condensation attenuates ARF activity, resulting in dramatic shifts in the auxin transcriptional landscape. Here, we perform a forward genetics screen for ARF hypercondensation, identifying an F-box protein, which we named AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR F-BOX1 (AFF1). Functional characterization of SCFAFF1 revealed that this E3 ubiquitin ligase directly interacts with ARF19 and ARF7 to regulate their accumulation, condensation, and nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning. Mutants defective in AFF1 display attenuated auxin responsiveness, and developmental defects, suggesting that SCFAFF1 -mediated regulation of ARF protein drives aspects of auxin response and plant development.","Auxin-driven transcriptional responses are mediated by ARF transcription factors. Here the authors characterize an F-box protein, AFF1, that regulates the accumulation, condensation, and nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of ARF19 and ARF7.",2022-07-11
1459,Nestin-dependent mitochondria-ER contacts define stem Leydig cell differentiation to attenuate male reproductive ageing,"Male reproductive system ageing is closely associated with deficiency in testosterone production due to loss of functional Leydig cells, which are differentiated from stem Leydig cells (SLCs). However, the relationship between SLC differentiation and ageing remains unknown. In addition, active lipid metabolism during SLC differentiation in the reproductive system requires transportation and processing of substrates among multiple organelles, e.g., mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), highlighting the importance of interorganelle contact. Here, we show that SLC differentiation potential declines with disordered intracellular homeostasis during SLC senescence. Mechanistically, loss of the intermediate filament Nestin results in lower differentiation capacity by separating mitochondria-ER contacts (MERCs) during SLC senescence. Furthermore, pharmacological intervention by melatonin restores Nestin-dependent MERCs, reverses SLC differentiation capacity and alleviates male reproductive system ageing. These findings not only explain SLC senescence from a cytoskeleton-dependent MERCs regulation mechanism, but also suggest a promising therapy targeting SLC differentiation for age-related reproductive system diseases.","The regulatory mechanisms contributing to male reproductive ageing are unknown. Here, the authors show that Nestin-dependent mito-ER contacts (MERCs) regulate stem Leydig cell (SLC) senescence and provide insights into SLCs-targeting therapies.",2022-07-11
1460,Time diffraction-free transverse orbital angular momentum beams,"The discovery of optical transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) has broadened our understanding of light and is expected to promote optics and other physics. However, some fundamental questions concerning the nature of such OAM remain, particularly whether they can survive from observed mode degradation and hold OAM values higher than 1. Here, we show that the strong degradation actually origins from inappropriate time-delayed kx–ω modulation, instead, for transverse OAM having inherent space-time coupling, immediate modulation is necessary. Thus, using immediate x–ω modulation, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally degradation-free spatiotemporal Bessel (STB) vortices with transverse OAM even beyond 102. Remarkably, we observe a time-symmetrical evolution, verifying pure time diffraction on transverse OAM beams. More importantly, we quantify such nontrivial evolution as an intrinsic dispersion factor, opening the door towards time diffraction-free STB vortices via dispersion engineering. Our results may find analogues in other physical systems, such as surface plasmon-polaritons, superfluids, and Bose-Einstein condensates.",It remains unclear whether transverse orbital angular momentum beams can maintain OAM values above 1. Here the authors demonstrate the generation of beams with transverse OAM up to 100 by the inverse design of phase and find an intrinsic dispersion factor to describe the nontrivial evolution of such beams.,2022-07-11
1461,Atomic-resolution structures from polycrystalline covalent organic frameworks with enhanced cryo-cRED,"The pursuit of atomic precision structure of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is the key to understanding the relationship between structures and properties, and further developing new materials with superior performance. Yet, a challenge of how to determine their atomic structures has always existed since the first COFs reported seventeen years ago. Here, we present a universal method for ab initio structure determination of polycrystalline three-dimensional (3D) COFs at atomic level using enhanced cryo-continuous rotation electron diffraction (cryo-cRED), which combines hierarchical cluster analysis with cryo-EM technique. The high-quality datasets possess not only up to 0.79-angstrom resolution but more than 90% completeness, leading to unambiguous solution and precise refinement with anisotropic temperature factors. With such a powerful method, the dynamic structures with flexible linkers, degree of interpenetration, position of functional groups, and arrangement of ordered guest molecules are successfully revealed with atomic precision in five 3D COFs, which are almost impossible to be obtained without atomic resolution structure solution. This study demonstrates a practicable strategy for determining the structures of polycrystalline COFs and other beam-sensitive materials and to help in the future discovery of novel materials on the other.","Structure determination of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is the key to pushing the development of COF-based materials further but precise determination of the structure of COFs is challenging.

1462,Machine learning-based tissue of origin classification for cancer of unknown primary diagnostics using genome-wide mutation features,"Cancers of unknown primary (CUP) origin account for ∼3% of all cancer diagnoses, whereby the tumor tissue of origin (TOO) cannot be determined. Using a uniformly processed dataset encompassing 6756 whole-genome sequenced primary and metastatic tumors, we develop Cancer of Unknown Primary Location Resolver (CUPLR), a random forest TOO classifier that employs 511 features based on simple and complex somatic driver and passenger mutations. CUPLR distinguishes 35 cancer (sub)types with ∼90% recall and ∼90% precision based on cross-validation and test set predictions. We find that structural variant derived features increase the performance and utility for classifying specific cancer types. With CUPLR, we could determine the TOO for 82/141 (58%) of CUP patients. Although CUPLR is based on machine learning, it provides a human interpretable graphical report with detailed feature explanations. The comprehensive output of CUPLR complements existing histopathological procedures and can enable improved diagnostics for CUP patients.","The original tumor location can be unclear for metastatic tumors. Here, the authors show that DNA sequencing of whole genomes can be used to classify metastatic tumors using a machine learning model, Cancer of Unknown Primary Location Resolver, in order to improve diagnosis and inform treatment decisions.",2022-07-11
1463,Spatially resolved proteomic map shows that extracellular matrix regulates epidermal growth,"Human skin comprises stratified squamous epithelium and dermis with various stromal cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). The basement membrane (BM), a thin layer at the top of the dermis, serves as a unique niche for determining the fate of epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) by transmitting physical and biochemical signals to establish epidermal cell polarity and maintain the hierarchical structure and function of skin tissue. However, how stem cell niches maintain tissue homeostasis and control wound healing by regulating the behavior of EpSCs is still not completely understood. In this study, a hierarchical skin proteome map is constructed using spatial quantitative proteomics combined with decellularization, laser capture microdissection, and mass spectrometry. The specific functions of different structures of normal native skin tissues or tissues with a dermatologic disease are analyzed in situ. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ)-induced protein ig-h3 (TGFBI), an ECM glycoprotein, in the BM is identified that could enhance the growth and function of EpSCs and promote wound healing. Our results provide insights into the way in which ECM proteins facilitate the growth and function of EpSCs as part of an important niche. The results may benefit the clinical treatment of skin ulcers or diseases with refractory lesions that involve epidermal cell dysfunction and re-epithelialization block in the future.","Ling Leng et al. construct a hierarchical skin proteome map and identify an extracellular matrix glycoprotein TGFBI, which is located in basement membrane and could enhance the growth and function of epidermal stem cells and promote wound healing.",2022-07-11
1464,Interchromosomal interaction of homologous Stat92E alleles regulates transcriptional switch during stem-cell differentiation,"Pairing of homologous chromosomes in somatic cells provides the opportunity of interchromosomal interaction between homologous gene regions. In the Drosophila male germline, the Stat92E gene is highly expressed in a germline stem cell (GSC) and gradually downregulated during the differentiation. Here we show that the pairing of Stat92E is always tight in GSCs and immediately loosened in differentiating daughter cells, gonialblasts (GBs). Disturbance of Stat92E pairing by relocation of one locus to another chromosome or by knockdown of global pairing/anti-pairing factors both result in a failure of Stat92E downregulation, suggesting that the pairing is required for the decline in transcription. Furthermore, the Stat92E enhancer, but not its transcription, is required for the change in pairing state, indicating that pairing is not a consequence of transcriptional changes. Finally, we show that the change in Stat92E pairing is dependent on asymmetric histone inheritance during the asymmetric division of GSCs. Taken together, we propose that the changes in Stat92E pairing status is an intrinsically programmed mechanism for enabling prompt cell fate switch during the differentiation of stem cells.","Asymmetric inheritance of organelles, proteins and RNAs occurs during stem cell division. Here the authors show the strength of pairing of homologous Stat92E loci, a stem cell-specific gene, changes immediately after the asymmetric division due to asymmetric inheritance of new histones to one of the daughter cells and is important for turning off gene expression in this cell as it differentiates.",2022-07-09
1465,Photonic-circuited resonance fluorescence of single molecules with an ultrastable lifetime-limited transition,"Resonance fluorescence as the emission of a resonantly-excited two-level quantum system promises indistinguishable single photons and coherent high-fidelity quantum-state manipulation of the matter qubit, which underpin many quantum information processing protocols. Real applications of the protocols demand high degrees of scalability and stability of the experimental platform, and thus favor quantum systems integrated on one chip. However, the on-chip solution confronts several formidable challenges compromising the scalability prospect, such as the randomness, spectral wandering and scattering background of the integrated quantum systems near heterogeneous and nanofabricated material interfaces. Here we report an organic-inorganic hybrid integrated quantum photonic platform that circuits background-free resonance fluorescence of single molecules with an ultrastable lifetime-limited transition. Our platform allows a collective alignment of the dipole orientations of many isolated molecules with the photonic waveguide. We demonstrate on-chip generation, beam splitting and routing of resonance-fluorescence single photons with a signal-to-background ratio over 3000 in the waveguide at the weak excitation limit. Crucially, we show the photonic-circuited single molecules possess a lifetime-limited-linewidth transition and exhibit inhomogeneous spectral broadenings of only about 5% over hours’ measurements. These findings and the versatility of our platform pave the way for scalable quantum photonic networks.","Single molecules can generate high-quality single photons for quantum technologies, but coupling to waveguides is difficult.

However, most reported scintillators are limited to inorganic or organic crystal materials, which have some obstacles in repeatability and processability. Here we present a facile strategy to achieve the X-ray-excited organic phosphorescent scintillation from amorphous copolymers through the copolymerization of the bromine-substituted chromophores and acrylic acid. These polymeric scintillators exhibit efficient X-ray responsibility and decent phosphorescent quantum yield up to 51.4% under ambient conditions. The universality of the design principle was further confirmed by a series of copolymers with multi-color radioluminescence ranging from green to orange-red. Moreover, we demonstrated their potential application in X-ray radiography. This finding not only outlines a feasible principle to develop X-ray responsive phosphorescent polymers, but also expands the potential applications of polymer materials with phosphorescence features.",The authors achieved the X-ray-excited organic phosphorescent scintillation from copolymers through copolymerization of bromine-substituted chromophores and acrylic acid and demonstrated their potential application in X-ray radiography.,2022-07-09
1467,Electrical resistance of the current collector controls lithium morphology,"The electrodeposition of low surface area lithium is critical to successful adoption of lithium metal batteries. Here, we discover the dependence of lithium metal morphology on electrical resistance of substrates, enabling us to design an alternative strategy for controlling lithium morphology and improving electrochemical performance. By modifying the current collector with atomic layer deposited conductive (ZnO, SnO2) and resistive (Al2O3) nanofilms, we show that conductive films promote the formation of high surface area lithium deposits, whereas highly resistive films promote the formation of lithium clusters of low surface area. We reveal an electrodeposition mechanism in which radial diffusion of electroactive species is promoted on resistive substrates, resulting in lateral growth of large (150 µm in diameter) planar lithium deposits. Using resistive substrates, similar lithium morphologies are formed in three distinct classes of electrolytes, resulting in up to ten-fold improvement in battery performance. Ultimately, we report anode-free pouch cells using the Al2O3-modified copper that maintain 60 % of their initial discharge capacity after 100 cycles, displaying the benefits of resistive substrates for controlling lithium electrodeposition.","The deployment of lithium metal batteries is forestalled by poor control over the deposition morphology of lithium.

1468,Precision digital mapping of endogenous and induced genomic DNA breaks by INDUCE-seq,"Understanding how breaks form and are repaired in the genome depends on the accurate measurement of the frequency and position of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). This is crucial for identification of a chemical’s DNA damage potential and for safe development of therapies, including genome editing technologies. Current DSB sequencing methods suffer from high background levels, the inability to accurately measure low frequency endogenous breaks and high sequencing costs. Here we describe INDUCE-seq, which overcomes these problems, detecting simultaneously the presence of low-level endogenous DSBs caused by physiological processes, and higher-level recurrent breaks induced by restriction enzymes or CRISPR-Cas nucleases. INDUCE-seq exploits an innovative NGS flow cell enrichment method, permitting the digital detection of breaks. It can therefore be used to determine the mechanism of DSB repair and to facilitate safe development of therapeutic genome editing. We further discuss how the method can be adapted to detect other genomic features.",Understanding how DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) form and are repaired in the genome depends on their accurate measurement.

1469,Chromatin sequesters pioneer transcription factor Sox2 from exerting force on DNA,"Biomolecular condensation constitutes an emerging mechanism for transcriptional regulation. Recent studies suggest that the co-condensation between transcription factors (TFs) and DNA can generate mechanical forces driving genome rearrangements. However, the reported forces generated by protein-DNA co-condensation are typically below one piconewton (pN), questioning its physiological significance. Moreover, the force-generating capacity of these condensates in the chromatin context remains unknown. Here, we show that Sox2, a nucleosome-binding pioneer TF, forms co-condensates with DNA and generates forces up to 7 pN, exerting considerable mechanical tension on DNA strands. We find that the disordered domains of Sox2 are required for maximum force generation but not for condensate formation. Furthermore, we show that nucleosomes dramatically attenuate the mechanical stress exerted by Sox2 by sequestering it from coalescing on bare DNA. Our findings reveal that TF-mediated DNA condensation can exert significant mechanical stress on the genome which can nonetheless be attenuated by the chromatin architecture.","Here the authors used single-molecule imaging and manipulation to study the mechanical effects of transcription factor Sox2 co-condensation with DNA and chromatin. They found that Sox2 condensates exert a high level of mechanical stress on DNA, but this stress is dramatically attenuated by nucleosomes assembled on the DNA.",2022-07-09

As wearable modules, microneedles can extract analytes of interest from interstitial fluid in a minimally invasive fashion. However, some microneedles are limited by their ability to perform highly effective extraction and real-time monitoring for macromolecule biomarkers simultaneously. Here we show the synergetic effect of CRISPR-activated graphene biointerfaces, and report an on-line wearable microneedle patch for extraction and in vivo long-term monitoring of universal cell-free DNA. In this study, this wearable system enables real-time monitoring of Epstein-Barr virus, sepsis, and kidney transplantation cell-free DNA, with anti-interference ability of 60% fetal bovine serum, and has satisfactory stable sensitivity for 10 days in vivo. The experimental results of immunodeficient mouse models shows the feasibility and practicability of this proposed method. This wearable patch holds great promise for long-term in vivo monitoring of cell-free DNA and could potentially be used for early disease screening and prognosis.","Real-time sensing of biomarkers via the use of wearable devices is a major aim of personalised medicine.

1471,Clinical characteristics and immune profile alterations in vaccinated individuals with breakthrough Delta SARS-CoV-2 infections,"Despite timely immunization programs, and efficacious vaccines conveying protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals have been reported. The Delta variant of concern (VOC) outbreak in Guangzhou resulted in local transmission in vaccinated and non-vaccinated residents, providing a unique opportunity to study the protective effects of the inactivated vaccines in breakthrough infection. Here, we find that the 2-dose vaccinated group has similar peak viral titers and comparable speeds of viral RNA clearance to the non-vaccinated group but accelerated viral suppression in the middle course of the disease. We quantitatively demonstrate that peak viral pneumonia is significantly mitigated in the 2-dose vaccine group (median 0.298%) compared with the non-vaccinated (5.77%) and 1-dose vaccine (3.34%) groups. Pneumonia absorbance is approximately 6 days ahead in the 2-dose group (median 10 days) than in the non-vaccinated group (16 days) (p = 0.003). We also observe reduced cytokine inflammation and markedly undisturbed gene transcription profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the 2-dose group. In short, our study demonstrates that prior vaccination substantially restrains pneumonia development, reduces cytokine storms, and facilitates clinical recovery.","SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals are a public health concern.

1472,All-fibre heterogeneously-integrated frequency comb generation using silicon core fibre,"Originally developed for metrology, optical frequency combs are becoming increasingly pervasive in a wider range of research topics including optical communications, spectroscopy, and radio or microwave signal processing. However, application demands in these fields can be more challenging as they require compact sources with a high tolerance to temperature variations that are capable of delivering flat comb spectra, high power per tone, narrow linewidth and high optical signal-to-noise ratio. This work reports the generation of a flat, high power frequency comb in the telecom band using a 17 mm fully-integrated silicon core fibre as a parametric mixer. Our all-fibre, cavity-free source combines the material benefits of planar waveguide structures with the advantageous properties of fibre platforms to achieve a 30 nm bandwidth comb source containing 143 tones with <3 kHz linewidth, 12 dB flatness, and >30 dB OSNR over the entire spectral region.","Silicon core fibre is a highly nonlinear waveguide that combines the benefits of both fibre and planar waveguide systems. Here, the authors demonstrate frequency comb generation using a fully-fibre integrated silicon core fibre as a nonlinear mixer.",2022-07-09
1473,Variance-quantitative trait loci enable systematic discovery of gene-environment interactions for cardiometabolic serum biomarkers,"Gene-environment interactions represent the modification of genetic effects by environmental exposures and are critical for understanding disease and informing personalized medicine. These often induce differential phenotypic variance across genotypes; these variance-quantitative trait loci can be prioritized in a two-stage interaction detection strategy to greatly reduce the computational and statistical burden and enable testing of a broader range of exposures. We perform genome-wide variance-quantitative trait locus analysis for 20 serum cardiometabolic biomarkers by multi-ancestry meta-analysis of 350,016 unrelated participants in the UK Biobank, identifying 182 independent locus-biomarker pairs (p < 4.5×10−9). Most are concentrated in a small subset (4%) of loci with genome-wide significant main effects, and 44% replicate (p < 0.05) in the Women’s Genome Health Study (N = 23,294). Next, we test each locus-biomarker pair for interaction across 2380 exposures, identifying 847 significant interactions (p < 2.4×10−7), of which 132 are independent (p < 0.05) after accounting for correlation between exposures. Specific examples demonstrate interaction of triglyceride-associated variants with distinct body mass- versus body fat-related exposures as well as genotype-specific associations between alcohol consumption and liver stress at the ADH1B gene. Our catalog of variance-quantitative trait loci and gene-environment interactions is publicly available in an online portal.","Understanding how our genes interact with the environment is critical to improving health. Using a large-scale discovery pipeline, here the authors investigate synergies between genetic variants and a broad range of environmental factors impacting cardiometabolic health.",2022-07-09
1474,Compulsive alcohol drinking in rodents is associated with altered representations of behavioral control and seeking in dorsal medial prefrontal cortex,"A key feature of compulsive alcohol drinking is continuing to drink despite negative consequences. To examine the changes in neural activity that underlie this behavior, compulsive alcohol drinking was assessed in a validated rodent model of heritable risk for excessive drinking (alcohol preferring (P) rats). Neural activity was measured in dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC—a brain region involved in maladaptive decision-making) and assessed via change point analyses and novel principal component analyses. Neural population representations of specific decision-making variables were measured to determine how they were altered in animals that drink alcohol compulsively. Compulsive animals showed weakened representations of behavioral control signals, but strengthened representations of alcohol seeking-related signals. Finally, chemogenetic-based excitation of dmPFC prevented escalation of compulsive alcohol drinking. Collectively, these data indicate that compulsive alcohol drinking in rats is associated with alterations in dmPFC neural activity that underlie diminished behavioral control and enhanced seeking.","Compulsive alcohol drinking is a core feature of alcohol use disorder. Here the authors find that in rodents, neural signals in a key decision-making brain region (dmPFC) shift from behavioral control to alcohol seeking during compulsive alcohol drinking behaviour.",2022-07-09
1475,Low-dimensional assemblies of metal-organic framework particles and mutually coordinated anisotropy,"Assembling metal-organic framework (MOF)-based particles is an emerging approach for creating colloidal superstructures and hierarchical functional materials. However, realization of this goal requires strategies that not only regulate particle interactions but also harness the anisotropic morphologies and functions of various frameworks. Here, by exploiting depletion interaction induced by ionic amphiphiles, we show the assembly of a broad range of low-dimensional MOF colloidal superstructures, including 1D straight chains, alternating or bundled chains, 2D films of hexagonal, square, centered rectangular, and snowflake-like architectures, and quasi-3D supercrystals. With well-defined polyhedral shapes, the MOF particles are mutually oriented upon assembly, producing super-frameworks with hierarchically coordinated crystallinity and micropores. We demonstrate this advantage by creating functional MOF films with optical anisotropy, in our cases, birefringence and anisotropic fluorescence. Given the variety of MOFs available, our technique should allow access to advanced materials for sensing, optics, and photonics.","Colloidal self-assembly is a powerful strategy for designing materials, and MOFs offer wide structural and functional diversity. Here, authors present the self-assembly of MOF microcrystals using depletion interactions to form low-dimensional MOF colloidal superstructures with anisotropic properties.",2022-07-09
1476,ADAMTS18+ villus tip telocytes maintain a polarized VEGFA signaling domain and fenestrations in nutrient-absorbing intestinal blood vessels,"The small intestinal villus tip is the first point of contact for lumen-derived substances including nutrients and microbial products. Electron microscopy studies from the early 1970s uncovered unusual spatial organization of small intestinal villus tip blood vessels: their exterior, epithelial-facing side is fenestrated, while the side facing the villus stroma is non-fenestrated, covered by pericytes and harbors endothelial nuclei. Such organization optimizes the absorption process, however the molecular mechanisms maintaining this highly specialized structure remain unclear. Here we report that perivascular LGR5+ villus tip telocytes (VTTs) are necessary for maintenance of villus tip endothelial cell polarization and fenestration by sequestering VEGFA signaling. Mechanistically, unique VTT expression of the protease ADAMTS18 is necessary for VEGFA signaling sequestration through limiting fibronectin accumulation. Therefore, we propose a model in which LGR5+ ADAMTS18+ telocytes are necessary to maintain a “just-right” level and location of VEGFA signaling in intestinal villus blood vasculature to ensure on one hand the presence of sufficient endothelial fenestrae, while avoiding excessive leakiness of the vessels and destabilization of villus tip epithelial structures.","The molecular mechanisms ensuring the specialized structure of small intestinal villus tip blood vessels are incompletely understood. Here the authors show that ADAMTS18+ telocytes maintain a “just-right” level and location of VEGFA signaling on intestinal villus blood vessels, thereby ensuring the presence of endothelial fenestrae for nutrient absorption, while avoiding excessive leakiness and destabilization of villus tip epithelial structures.",2022-07-09
1477,Mechanism of fertilization-induced auxin synthesis in the endosperm for seed and fruit development,"The dominance of flowering plants on earth is owed largely to the evolution of maternal tissues such as fruit and seedcoat that protect and disseminate the seeds. The mechanism of how fertilization triggers the development of these specialized maternal tissues is not well understood. A key event is the induction of auxin synthesis in the endosperm, and the mobile auxin subsequently stimulates seedcoat and fruit development. However, the regulatory mechanism of auxin synthesis in the endosperm remains unknown. Here, we show that a type I MADS box gene AGL62 is required for the activation of auxin synthesis in the endosperm in both Fragaria vesca, a diploid strawberry, and in Arabidopsis. Several strawberry FveATHB genes were identified as downstream targets of FveAGL62 and act to repress auxin biosynthesis. In this work, we identify a key mechanism for auxin induction to mediate fertilization success, a finding broadly relevant to flowering plants.","In flowering plants, fertilization triggers auxin synthesis in the endosperm to promote seed and fruit development. Here the authors show that an MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 is required to activate auxin synthesis in the endosperms of Fragaria vesca, a diploid strawberry, and Arabidopsis.",2022-07-09
1478,"Decoupling PER phosphorylation, stability and rhythmic expression from circadian clock function by abolishing PER-CK1 interaction","Robust rhythms of abundances and phosphorylation profiles of PERIOD proteins were thought be the master rhythms that drive mammalian circadian clock functions. PER stability was proposed to be a major determinant of period length. In mammals, CK1 forms stable complexes with PER. Here we identify the PER residues essential for PER-CK1 interaction. In cells and in mice, their mutation abolishes PER phosphorylation and CLOCK hyperphosphorylation, resulting in PER stabilization, arrhythmic PER abundance and impaired negative feedback process, indicating that PER acts as the CK1 scaffold in circadian feedback mechanism. Surprisingly, the mutant mice exhibit robust short period locomotor activity and other physiological rhythms but low amplitude molecular rhythms. PER-CK1 interaction has two opposing roles in regulating CLOCK-BMAL1 activity. These results indicate that the circadian clock can function independently of PER phosphorylation and abundance rhythms due to another PER-CRY-dependent feedback mechanism and that period length can be uncoupled from PER stability.","PERIOD proteins, the core components of the mammalian circadian clock, act as the CK1 scaffold in the negative feedback process. Surprisingly, the mouse circadian clock can function independent of PER phosphorylation and PER abundance rhythms.",2022-07-09
1479,A Nodal enhanced micropeptide NEMEP regulates glucose uptake during mesendoderm differentiation of embryonic stem cells,"TGF-β family proteins including Nodal are known as central regulators of early development in metazoans, yet our understanding of the scope of Nodal signaling’s downstream targets and associated physiological mechanisms in specifying developmentally appropriate cell fates is far from complete. Here, we identified a highly conserved, transmembrane micropeptide—NEMEP—as a direct target of Nodal signaling in mesendoderm differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and this micropeptide is essential for mesendoderm differentiation. We showed that NEMEP interacts with the glucose transporters GLUT1/GLUT3 and promotes glucose uptake likely through these interactions. Thus, beyond expanding the scope of known Nodal signaling targets in early development and showing that this target micropeptide augments the glucose uptake during mesendoderm differentiation, our study provides a clear example for the direct functional impact of altered glucose metabolism on cell fate determination.","Fu et al. identify the highly conserved, transmembrane micropeptide, NEMEP, as a direct target of Nodal signaling, essential for mesendoderm differentiation.

1480,Probing interlayer shear thermal deformation in atomically-thin van der Waals layered materials,"Atomically-thin van der Waals layered materials, with both high in-plane stiffness and bending flexibility, offer a unique platform for thermomechanical engineering. However, the lack of effective characterization techniques hinders the development of this research topic. Here, we develop a direct experimental method and effective theoretical model to study the mechanical, thermal, and interlayer properties of van der Waals materials. This is accomplished by using a carefully designed WSe2-based heterostructure, where monolayer WSe2 serves as an in-situ strain meter. Combining experimental results and theoretical modelling, we are able to resolve the shear deformation and interlayer shear thermal deformation of each individual layer quantitatively in van der Waals materials. Our approach also provides important interlayer coupling information as well as key thermal parameters. The model can be applied to van der Waals materials with different layer numbers and various boundary conditions for both thermally-induced and mechanically-induced deformations.","Van der Waals materials exhibit unique thermomechanical properties, but interlayer deformations are usually challenging to measure. Here, the authors exploit the strain-dependent optical properties of monolayer WSe2 to quantitatively probe the interlayer shear thermal deformations and interlayer coupling in phosphorene and hexagonal boron nitride.",2022-07-09
1481,Multi-modal molecular programs regulate melanoma cell state,"Melanoma cells display distinct intrinsic phenotypic states. Here, we seek to characterize the molecular regulation of these states using multi-omic analyses of whole exome, transcriptome, microRNA, long non-coding RNA and DNA methylation data together with reverse-phase protein array data on a panel of 68 highly annotated early passage melanoma cell lines. We demonstrate that clearly defined cancer cell intrinsic transcriptomic programs are maintained in melanoma cells ex vivo and remain highly conserved within melanoma tumors, are associated with distinct immune features within tumors, and differentially correlate with checkpoint inhibitor and adoptive T cell therapy efficacy. Through integrative analyses we demonstrate highly complex multi-omic regulation of melanoma cell intrinsic programs that provide key insights into the molecular maintenance of phenotypic states. These findings have implications for cancer biology and the identification of new therapeutic strategies. Further, these deeply characterized cell lines will serve as an invaluable resource for future research in the field.","The regulation of the distinct intrinsic phenotypic states in melanoma remain poorly characterised. Here, multi-omics analysis for a panel of 68 early passage melanoma cell lines reveals that cancer cell intrinsic transcriptomic programs are associated with distinct immune features.",2022-07-09
1482,Probing strigolactone perception mechanisms with rationally designed small-molecule agonists stimulating germination of root parasitic weeds,"The development of potent strigolactone (SL) agonists as suicidal germination inducers could be a useful strategy for controlling root parasitic weeds, but uncertainty about the SL perception mechanism impedes real progress. Here we describe small-molecule agonists that efficiently stimulate Phelipanchce aegyptiaca, and Striga hermonthica, germination in concentrations as low as 10−8 to 10−17 M. We show that full efficiency of synthetic SL agonists in triggering signaling through the Striga SL receptor, ShHTL7, depends on the receptor-catalyzed hydrolytic reaction of the agonists. Additionally, we reveal that the stereochemistry of synthetic SL analogs affects the hydrolytic ability of ShHTL7 by influencing the probability of the privileged conformations of ShHTL7. Importantly, an alternative ShHTL7-mediated hydrolysis mechanism, proceeding via nucleophilic attack of the NE2 atom of H246 to the 2′C of the D-ring, is reported. Together, our findings provide insight into SL hydrolysis and structure-perception mechanisms, and potent suicide germination stimulants, which would contribute to the elimination of the noxious parasitic weeds.",Strigolactone agonists could potentially help control noxious weeds by promoting suicidal germination.

1483,Trade off-free entanglement stabilization in a superconducting qutrit-qubit system,"Quantum reservoir engineering is a powerful framework for autonomous quantum state preparation and error correction. However, traditional approaches to reservoir engineering are hindered by unavoidable coherent leakage out of the target state, which imposes an inherent trade off between achievable steady-state state fidelity and stabilization rate. In this work we demonstrate a protocol that achieves trade off-free Bell state stabilization in a qutrit-qubit system realized on a circuit-QED platform. We accomplish this by creating a purely dissipative channel for population transfer into the target state, mediated by strong parametric interactions coupling the second-excited state of a superconducting transmon and the engineered bath resonator. Our scheme achieves a state preparation fidelity of 84% with a stabilization time constant of 339 ns, leading to a 54 ns error-time product in a solid-state quantum information platform.",The approach to stabilizing a quantum state by coupling to engineered reservoirs is limited by a trade-off between state fidelity and stabilization rate.

1484,Acetyl-CoA-Carboxylase 1-mediated de novo fatty acid synthesis sustains Lgr5+ intestinal stem cell function,"Basic processes of the fatty acid metabolism have an important impact on the function of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). However, while the role of cellular fatty acid oxidation is well appreciated, it is not clear how de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS) influences the biology of IECs. We report here that interfering with de novo FAS by deletion of the enzyme Acetyl-CoA-Carboxylase (ACC)1 in IECs results in the loss of epithelial crypt structures and a specific decline in Lgr5+ intestinal epithelial stem cells (ISC). Mechanistically, ACC1-mediated de novo FAS supports the formation of intestinal organoids and the differentiation of complex crypt structures by sustaining the nuclear accumulation of PPARδ/β-catenin in ISCs. The dependency of ISCs on cellular de novo FAS is tuned by the availability of environmental lipids, as an excess delivery of external fatty acids is sufficient to rescue the defect in crypt formation. Finally, inhibition of ACC1 reduces the formation of tumors in colitis-associated colon cancer, together highlighting the importance of cellular lipogenesis for sustaining ISC function and providing a potential perspective to colon cancer therapy.",Here the authors report that inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis by deleting the enzyme Acetyl-CoA-Carboxylase 1 in the intestinal epithelium results in the loss of crypt structures and a specific decline in Lgr5+ intestinal epithelial stem cells.,2022-07-09
1485,Ciliary transition zone proteins coordinate ciliary protein composition and ectosome shedding,"The transition zone (TZ) of the cilium/flagellum serves as a diffusion barrier that controls the entry/exit of ciliary proteins. Mutations of the TZ proteins disrupt barrier function and lead to multiple human diseases. However, the systematic regulation of ciliary composition and signaling-related processes by different TZ proteins is not completely understood. Here, we reveal that loss of TCTN1 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii disrupts the assembly of wedge-shaped structures in the TZ. Proteomic analysis of cilia from WT and three TZ mutants, tctn1, cep290, and nphp4, shows a unique role of each TZ subunit in the regulation of ciliary composition, explaining the phenotypic diversity of different TZ mutants. Interestingly, we find that defects in the TZ impair the formation and biological activity of ciliary ectosomes. Collectively, our findings provide systematic insights into the regulation of ciliary composition by TZ proteins and reveal a link between the TZ and ciliary ectosomes.","Cilia project from cells to serve sensory functions, and ciliary disruption can result in multiple disorders known as ciliopathies.

1486,Expanding chemical space by para-C−H arylation of arenes,"Biaryl scaffolds are privileged templates used in the discovery and design of therapeutics with high affinity and specificity for a broad range of protein targets. Biaryls are found in the structures of therapeutics, including antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, neurological and antihypertensive drugs. However, existing synthetic routes to biphenyls rely on traditional coupling approaches that require both arenes to be prefunctionalized with halides or pseudohalides with the desired regiochemistry. Therefore, the coupling of drug fragments may be challenging via conventional approaches. As an attractive alternative, directed C−H activation has the potential to be a versatile tool to form para-substituted biphenyl motifs selectively. However, existing C–H arylation protocols are not suitable for drug entities as they are hindered by catalyst deactivation by polar and delicate functionalities present alongside the instability of macrocyclic intermediates required for para-C−H activation. To address this challenge, we have developed a robust catalytic system that displays unique efficacy towards para-arylation of highly functionalized substrates such as drug entities, giving access to structurally diversified biaryl scaffolds. This diversification process provides access to an expanded chemical space for further exploration in drug discovery. Further, the applicability of the transformation is realized through the synthesis of drug molecules bearing a biphenyl fragment. Computational and experimental mechanistic studies further provide insight into the catalytic cycle operative in this versatile C−H arylation protocol.","Biaryls are privileged structural motif used in the discovery and design of therapeutics with high affinity and specificity for a broad range of protein targets.

1487,Megathrust reflectivity reveals the updip limit of the 2014 Iquique earthquake rupture,"The updip limit of seismic rupture during a megathrust earthquake exerts a major control on the size of the resulting tsunami. Offshore Northern Chile, the 2014 Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake ruptured the plate boundary between 19.5° and 21°S. Rupture terminated under the mid-continental slope and did not propagate updip to the trench. Here, we use state-of-the-art seismic reflection data to investigate the tectonic setting associated with the apparent updip arrest of rupture propagation at 15 km depth during the Iquique earthquake. We document a spatial correspondence between the rupture area and the seismic reflectivity of the plate boundary. North and updip of the rupture area, a coherent, highly reflective plate boundary indicates excess fluid pressure, which may prevent the accumulation of elastic strain. In contrast, the rupture area is characterized by the absence of plate boundary reflectivity, which suggests low fluid pressure that results in stress accumulation and thus controls the extent of earthquake rupture. Generalizing these results, seismic reflection data can provide insights into the physical state of the shallow plate boundary and help to assess the potential for future shallow rupture in the absence of direct measurements of interplate deformation from most outermost forearc slopes.","The rupture area of the 2014 Iquique earthquake offshore northern Chile was spatially limited to a region where the plate boundary is non-reflective in seismic images, indicative of low fluid pressure. In contrast, north and updip of the rupture area, a coherent highly reflective plate boundary indicates excess fluid pressure, which may inhibit strain accumulation, while strain release in the non-reflective rupture area occurs during large earthquakes.",2022-07-08

Herein we report electrochemical C–H hydroxylation of arenes in continuous flow for the synthesis of phenols. The method is characterized by broad scope (compatible with arenes of diverse electronic properties), mild conditions without any catalysts or chemical oxidants, and excellent scalability as demonstrated by the continuous production of 1 mol (204 grams) of one of the phenol products.",The direct hydroxylation of arene C–H bonds is a highly sought-after transformation but with little literature precedent.

1489,Synthetic phosphoethanolamine-modified oligosaccharides reveal the importance of glycan length and substitution in biofilm-inspired assemblies,"Bacterial biofilm matrices are nanocomposites of proteins and polysaccharides with remarkable mechanical properties. Efforts understanding and tuning the protein component have been extensive, whereas the polysaccharide part remained mostly overlooked. The discovery of phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) modified cellulose in E. coli biofilms revealed that polysaccharide functionalization alters the biofilm properties. To date, the pattern of pEtN cellulose and its mode of interactions with proteins remains elusive. Herein, we report a model system based on synthetic epitomes to explore the role of pEtN in biofilm-inspired assemblies. Nine pEtN-modified oligosaccharides were synthesized with full control over the length, degree and pattern of pEtN substitution. The oligomers were co-assembled with a representative peptide, triggering the formation of fibers in a length dependent manner. We discovered that the pEtN pattern modulates the adhesion of biofilm-inspired matrices, while the peptide component controls its stiffness. Unnatural oligosaccharides tune or disrupt the assembly morphology, revealing interesting targets for polysaccharide engineering to develop tunable bio-inspired materials.","The phosphoethanolamine modified cellulose in E. colibiofilms has revealed that polysaccharide functionalization alters the biofilm properties.

1491,Temperature elevations can induce switches to homoclinic action potentials that alter neural encoding and synchronization,"Almost seventy years after the discovery of the mechanisms of action potential generation, some aspects of their computational consequences are still not fully understood. Based on mathematical modeling, we here explore a type of action potential dynamics – arising from a saddle-node homoclinic orbit bifurcation - that so far has received little attention. We show that this type of dynamics is to be expected by specific changes in common physiological parameters, like an elevation of temperature. Moreover, we demonstrate that it favours synchronization patterns in networks – a feature that becomes particularly prominent when system parameters change such that homoclinic spiking is induced. Supported by in-vitro hallmarks for homoclinic spikes in the rodent brain, we hypothesize that the prevalence of homoclinic spikes in the brain may be underestimated and provide a missing link between the impact of biophysical parameters on abrupt transitions between asynchronous and synchronous states of electrical activity in the brain.","The intrinsic dynamics of neurons, in particular the generation action potentials, can impact neural network states and processes of encoding information. The authors demonstrate how the elevation of temperature induces a type of action potential dynamics that favors synchronization patterns in neural networks.",2022-07-08

Previous studies consistently demonstrate desert wetting during times of Earth’s high orbital eccentricity and strong summer monsoon. Here we report the first evidence demonstrating desert wetting during Earth’s low orbital eccentricity from the late Miocene strata of the northwestern Tarim Basin of northern China, which is commonly thought to be beyond the range of Asian monsoon precipitation. Using mechanisms for modern Tarim wetting as analogs, we propose that East Asian summer monsoon weakening enhanced westward moisture transport and caused opposite desert wetting pattern to that observed in monsoon marginal region deserts. This inference is supported by our model simulations. This result has far-reaching implications for understanding environmental variations in non-monsoonal deserts in the next few thousands of years under high atmospheric CO2 content and low eccentricity.",The late Miocene Tarim desert experienced periodic wetting and greening in eccentricity minimum and East Asian summer monsoon weakening,2022-07-08
1493,TRIM24 is an insulin-responsive regulator of P-bodies,"Insulin is a potent inducer of mRNA transcription and translation, contributing to metabolic regulation. Insulin has also been suggested to regulate mRNA stability through the processing body (P-body) molecular machinery. However, whether and how insulin regulates mRNA stability via P-bodies is not clear. Here we show that the E3-ligase TRIM24 is a critical factor linking insulin signalling to P-bodies. Upon insulin stimulation, protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) phosphorylates TRIM24 and stimulates its shuttling from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. TRIM24 interacts with several critical components of P-bodies in the cytoplasm, promoting their polyubiquitylation, which consequently stabilises Pparγ mRNA. Inactivation of TRIM24 E3-ligase activity or prevention of its phosphorylation via knockin mutations in mice promotes hepatic Pparγ degradation via P-bodies. Consequently, both knockin mutations alleviate hepatosteatosis in mice fed on a high-fat diet. Our results demonstrate the critical role of TRIM24 in linking insulin signalling to P-bodies and have therapeutic implications for the treatment of hepatosteatosis.","Insulin promotes hepatic lipogenesis, though underlying regulation remains unclear. Here the authors show that insulin translocates TRIM24 from the nucleus into cytosolic P-bodies to stabilise hepatic Pparγ mRNA, and that inactivation of TRIM24 promotes Pparγ degradation and alleviates hepatosteatosis.",2022-07-08
1494,Optimal acceleration voltage for near-atomic resolution imaging of layer-stacked 2D polymer thin films,"Despite superb instrumental resolution in modern transmission electron microscopes (TEM), high-resolution imaging of organic two-dimensional (2D) materials is a formidable task. Here, we present that the appropriate selection of the incident electron energy plays a crucial role in reducing the gap between achievable resolution in the image and the instrumental limit. Among a broad range of electron acceleration voltages (300 kV, 200 kV, 120 kV, and 80 kV) tested, we found that the highest resolution in the HRTEM image is achieved at 120 kV, which is 1.9 Å. In two imine-based 2D polymer thin films, unexpected molecular interstitial defects were unraveled. Their structural nature is identified with the aid of quantum mechanical calculations. Furthermore, the increased image resolution and enhanced image contrast at 120 kV enabled the detection of functional groups at the pore interfaces. The experimental setup has also been employed for an amorphous organic 2D material.","High-resolution imaging of organic 2D materials using transmission electron microscopes is challenging.

1495,Energy-selective confinement of fusion-born alpha particles during internal relaxations in a tokamak plasma,"Long-pulse operation of a self-sustained fusion reactor using toroidal magnetic containment requires control over the content of alpha particles produced by D-T fusion reactions. On the one hand, MeV-class alpha particles must stay confined to heat the plasma. On the other hand, decelerated helium ash must be expelled before diluting the fusion fuel. Here, we report results of kinetic-magnetohydrodynamic hybrid simulations of a large tokamak plasma that confirm the existence of a parameter window where such energy-selective confinement can be accomplished by exploiting internal relaxation events known as sawtooth crashes. The physical picture — a synergy between magnetic geometry, optimal crash duration and rapid particle motion — is completed by clarifying the role of magnetic drifts. Besides causing asymmetry between co- and counter-going particle populations, magnetic drifts determine the size of the confinement window by dictating where and how much reconnection occurs in particle orbit topology.",Confining plasma for fusion requires controlling many parameters. Here the authors report the existence of a narrow parameter space for the simultaneous confinement of energetic alpha particles and removal of slowed-down helium ash in a magnetically confined fusion plasma by using kinetic-magnetohydrodynamic hybrid simulations.,2022-07-08
1496,Shallow subsurface heat recycling is a sustainable global space heating alternative,"Despite the global interest in green energy alternatives, little attention has focused on the large-scale viability of recycling the ground heat accumulated due to urbanization, industrialization and climate change. Here we show this theoretical heat potential at a multi-continental scale by first leveraging datasets of groundwater temperature and lithology to assess the distribution of subsurface thermal pollution. We then evaluate subsurface heat recycling for three scenarios: a status quo scenario representing present-day accumulated heat, a recycled scenario with ground temperatures returned to background values, and a climate change scenario representing projected warming impacts. Our analyses reveal that over 50% of sites show recyclable underground heat pollution in the status quo, 25% of locations would be feasible for long-term heat recycling for the recycled scenario, and at least 83% for the climate change scenario. Results highlight that subsurface heat recycling warrants consideration in the move to a low-carbon economy in a warmer world.","Using shallow geothermal energy systems to recycle the heat accumulating in the subsurface due to climate change and urbanization is a feasible, sustainable, and opportunistic alternative to conventional space heating in the face of climate change",2022-07-08
1497,Lipolysis regulates major transcriptional programs in brown adipocytes,"β-Adrenergic signaling is a core regulator of brown adipocyte function stimulating both lipolysis and transcription of thermogenic genes, thereby expanding the capacity for oxidative metabolism. We have used pharmacological inhibitors and a direct activator of lipolysis to acutely modulate the activity of lipases, thereby enabling us to uncover lipolysis-dependent signaling pathways downstream of β-adrenergic signaling in cultured brown adipocytes. Here we show that induction of lipolysis leads to acute induction of several gene programs and is required for transcriptional regulation by β-adrenergic signals. Using machine-learning algorithms to infer causal transcription factors, we show that PPARs are key mediators of lipolysis-induced activation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and thermogenesis. Importantly, however, lipolysis also activates the unfolded protein response and regulates the core circadian transcriptional machinery independently of PPARs. Our results demonstrate that lipolysis generates important metabolic signals that exert profound pleiotropic effects on transcription and function of cultured brown adipocytes.","β-Adrenergic signaling is a core regulator of brown adipocyte function. Here, the authors provide unbiased insight into the transcriptional network controlled by lipolysis in brown adipocytes, showing that lipolysis is required for much of the thermogenic gene program activated by β-adrenergic signals.",2022-07-08
1498,Increased Indian Ocean-North Atlantic Ocean warming chain under greenhouse warming,"Over the past half a century, both the Indian Ocean (IO) and the North Atlantic Ocean (NA) exhibit strong warming trends like a global mean surface temperature (SST). Here, we show that not only simply as a result of increased greenhouse gases, but the IO-NA interaction through atmospheric teleconnection boosts up their warming trends. Climate model simulations demonstrate that the IO warming increases the NA SST by enhancing the longwave radiation through atmospheric teleconnection, subsequently, the warmer NA SST-induced atmospheric teleconnection leads to IO warming by reducing evaporative cooling with weakened surface winds. This two-way interaction (i.e., IO-NA warming chain) acts as positive feedback that reinforces warming over both ocean basins. The Pacific Ocean is partly involved in this warming chain as a modulator in an interdecadal timescale. These results highlight the importance of understanding ocean-basin interactions that may provide a more accurate future projection of warming.","Over the past half century, both the Indian Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean exhibit strong warming trends like a global mean surface temperature. In this study, the authors show that not only an increase of greenhouse gases, but also atmospheric teleconnections boost the observed warming trends.",2022-07-08
1499,GLI3 regulates muscle stem cell entry into GAlert and self-renewal,"Satellite cells are required for the growth, maintenance, and regeneration of skeletal muscle. Quiescent satellite cells possess a primary cilium, a structure that regulates the processing of the GLI family of transcription factors. Here we find that GLI3 processing by the primary cilium plays a critical role for satellite cell function. GLI3 is required to maintain satellite cells in a G0 dormant state. Strikingly, satellite cells lacking GLI3 enter the GAlert state in the absence of injury. Furthermore, GLI3 depletion stimulates expansion of the stem cell pool. As a result, satellite cells lacking GLI3 display rapid cell-cycle entry, increased proliferation and augmented self-renewal, and markedly enhanced regenerative capacity. At the molecular level, we establish that the loss of GLI3 induces mTORC1 signaling activation. Therefore, our results provide a mechanism by which GLI3 controls mTORC1 signaling, consequently regulating muscle stem cell activation and fate.","Primary cilia regulate the processing of the GLI transcription factors and Hedgehog signaling. Here, the authors show that cilia-related GLI3 controls both the quiescence-to-activation transition and self-renewal in muscle stem cells.",2022-07-08
1500,A calibratable sensory neuron based on epitaxial VO2 for spike-based neuromorphic multisensory system,"Neuromorphic perception systems inspired by biology have tremendous potential in efficiently processing multi-sensory signals from the physical world, but a highly efficient hardware element capable of sensing and encoding multiple physical signals is still lacking. Here, we report a spike-based neuromorphic perception system consisting of calibratable artificial sensory neurons based on epitaxial VO2, where the high crystalline quality of VO2 leads to significantly improved cycle-to-cycle uniformity. A calibration resistor is introduced to optimize device-to-device consistency, and to adapt the VO2 neuron to different sensors with varied resistance level, a scaling resistor is further incorporated, demonstrating cross-sensory neuromorphic perception component that can encode illuminance, temperature, pressure and curvature signals into spikes. These components are utilized to monitor the curvatures of fingers, thereby achieving hand gesture classification. This study addresses the fundamental cycle-to-cycle and device-to-device variation issues of sensory neurons, therefore promoting the construction of neuromorphic perception systems for e-skin and neurorobotics.","A highly efficient hardware element capable of sensing and encoding multiple physical signals is still lacking. Here, the authors report a spike-based neuromorphic perception system consisting of tunable and highly uniform artificial sensory neurons based on epitaxial VO2 capable of hand gesture classification.",2022-07-08
1501,Effectiveness and protection duration of Covid-19 vaccines and previous infection against any SARS-CoV-2 infection in young adults,"Data on effectiveness and protection duration of Covid-19 vaccines and previous infection against general SARS-CoV-2 infection in general populations are limited. Here we evaluate protection from Covid-19 vaccination (primary series) and previous infection in 21,261 university students undergoing repeated surveillance testing between 8/8/2021–12/04/2021, during which B.1.617 (delta) was the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant. Estimated mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and AD26.COV2.S effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection is 75.4% (95% CI: 70.5-79.5), 65.7% (95% CI: 61.1-69.8), and 42.8% (95% CI: 26.1–55.8), respectively. Among previously infected individuals, protection is 72.9% when unvaccinated (95% CI: 66.1–78.4) and increased by 22.1% with full vaccination (95% CI: 15.8–28.7). Statistically significant decline in protection is observed for mRNA-1273 (P < .001), BNT162b2 (P < .001), but not Ad26.CoV2.S (P = 0.40) or previous infection (P = 0.12). mRNA vaccine protection dropped 29.7% (95% CI: 17.9–41.6) six months post- vaccination, from 83.2% to 53.5%. We conclude that the 2-dose mRNA vaccine series initially offers strong protection against general SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the delta variant in young adults, but protection substantially decreases over time. These findings indicate that vaccinated individuals may still contribute to community spread. While previous SARS-CoV-2 infection consistently provides moderately strong protection against repeat infection from delta, vaccination yields a substantial increase in protection.","Here the authors estimate effectiveness of three COVID-19 vaccines in university students and find that 2-dose mRNA vaccines offer strong protection against general SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by delta, but protection substantially declines over 6 months. While previous infection protects against reinfection, vaccination substantially increases protection.",2022-07-08
1502,Pro-inflammatory cytokines mediate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like transition of pediatric posterior fossa ependymoma,"Pediatric ependymoma is a devastating brain cancer marked by its relapsing pattern and lack of effective chemotherapies. This shortage of treatments is due to limited knowledge about ependymoma tumorigenic mechanisms. By means of single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling of posterior fossa primary tumors and distal metastases, we reveal key transcription factors and enhancers associated with the differentiation of ependymoma tumor cells into tumor-derived cell lineages and their transition into a mesenchymal-like state. We identify NFκB, AP-1, and MYC as mediators of this transition, and show that the gene expression profiles of tumor cells and infiltrating microglia are consistent with abundant pro-inflammatory signaling between these populations. In line with these results, both TGF-β1 and TNF-α induce the expression of mesenchymal genes on a patient-derived cell model, and TGF-β1 leads to an invasive phenotype. Altogether, these data suggest that tumor gliosis induced by inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress underlies the mesenchymal phenotype of posterior fossa ependymoma.","The molecular mechanisms underlying ependymoma tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. Here, single cell analysis of posterior fossa primary tumours and distal metastases highlights the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition.",2022-07-08
1503,Cation-selective two-dimensional polyimine membranes for high-performance osmotic energy conversion,"Two-dimensional (2D) membranes are emerging candidates for osmotic energy conversion. However, the trade-off between ion selectivity and conductivity remains the key bottleneck. Here we demonstrate a fully crystalline imine-based 2D polymer (2DPI) membrane capable of combining excellent ionic conductivity and high selectivity for osmotic energy conversion. The 2DPI can preferentially transport cations with Na+ selectivity coefficient of 0.98 (Na+/Cl− selectivity ratio ~84) and K+ selectivity coefficient of 0.93 (K+/Cl− ratio ~29). Moreover, the nanometer-scale thickness (~70 nm) generates a substantially high ionic flux, contributing to a record power density of up to ~53 W m−2, which is superior to most of nanoporous 2D membranes (0.8~35 W m−2). Density functional theory unveils that the oxygen and imine nitrogen can both function as the active sites depending on the ionization state of hydroxyl groups, and the enhanced interaction of Na+ versus K+ with 2DPI plays a significant role in directing the ion selectivity.","Two-dimensional (2D) membranes are emerging candidates for osmotic energy conversion but the trade-off between ion selectivity and conductivity remains the key bottleneck. Here, the authors demonstrate a fully crystalline imine-based 2D polymer membrane capable of combining excellent ionic conductivity and high selectivity for osmotic energy conversion.",2022-07-08
1504,Widespread increasing vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture,"Global vegetation and associated ecosystem services critically depend on soil moisture availability which has decreased in many regions during the last three decades. While spatial patterns of vegetation sensitivity to global soil water have been recently investigated, long-term changes in vegetation sensitivity to soil water availability are still unclear. Here we assess global vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture during 1982-2017 by applying explainable machine learning with observation-based leaf area index (LAI) and hydro-climate anomaly data. We show that LAI sensitivity to soil moisture significantly increases in many semi-arid and arid regions. LAI sensitivity trends are associated with multiple hydro-climate and ecological variables, and strongest increasing trends occur in the most water-sensitive regions which additionally experience declining precipitation. State-of-the-art land surface models do not reproduce this increasing sensitivity as they misrepresent water-sensitive regions and sensitivity strength. Our sensitivity results imply an increasing ecosystem vulnerability to water availability which can lead to exacerbated reductions in vegetation carbon uptake under future intensified drought, consequently amplifying climate change.","Water availability is a major control of vegetation dynamics and terrestrial carbon cycling. Here, the authors show that vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture has been increasing in the last 36 years, especially in (semi)arid areas, and that state-of-the-art land surface models fail to capture this trend.",2022-07-08
1505,A third vaccination with a single T cell epitope confers protection in a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Understanding the mechanisms and impact of booster vaccinations are essential in the design and delivery of vaccination programs. Here we show that a three dose regimen of a synthetic peptide vaccine elicits an accruing CD8+ T cell response against one SARS-CoV-2 Spike epitope. We see protection against lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model in the absence of neutralizing antibodies, but two dose approaches are insufficient to confer protection. The third vaccine dose of the single T cell epitope peptide results in superior generation of effector-memory T cells and tissue-resident memory T cells, and these tertiary vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells are characterized by enhanced polyfunctional cytokine production. Moreover, fate mapping shows that a substantial fraction of the tertiary CD8+ effector-memory T cells develop from re-migrated tissue-resident memory T cells. Thus, repeated booster vaccinations quantitatively and qualitatively improve the CD8+ T cell response leading to protection against otherwise lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Vaccination regimens and the number of doses required for optimal immunity and protection are critical factors in the translation of vaccines. Here the authors show administration of a three dose protocol of a single T cell epitope to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces a robust CD8+ T cell response and confers protection in a lethal murine challenge model of infection.,2022-07-08
1506,"The effect of COVID certificates on vaccine uptake, health outcomes, and the economy","In the COVID-19 pandemic many countries required COVID certificates, proving vaccination, recovery, or a recent negative test, to access public and private venues. We estimate their effect on vaccine uptake for France, Germany, and Italy using counterfactuals constructed via innovation diffusion theory. The announcement of COVID certificates during summer 2021 were associated – although causality cannot be directly inferred – with increased vaccine uptake in France of 13.0 (95% CI 9.7–14.9) percentage points (p.p.) of the total population until the end of the year, in Germany 6.2 (2.6–6.9) p.p., and in Italy 9.7 (5.4–12.3) p.p. Based on these estimates, an additional 3979 (3453–4298) deaths in France, 1133 (−312–1358) in Germany, and 1331 (502–1794) in Italy were averted; and gross domestic product (GDP) losses of €6.0 (5.9–6.1) billion in France, €1.4 (1.3–1.5) billion in Germany, and €2.1 (2.0–2.2) billion in Italy were prevented. Notably, in France, the application of COVID certificates averted high intensive care unit occupancy levels where prior lockdowns were instated.","Many countries introduced COVID certificates that were required to access public venues. Here, the authors analyse data from France, Germany, and Italy, and estimate that these policies led to increased vaccine uptake of 6-13 percentage points with subsequent beneficial impacts on health and economic outcomes.",2022-07-08
1507,Subnanometric Ru clusters with upshifted D band center improve performance for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction,"Subnanometric metal clusters usually have unique electronic structures and may display electrocatalytic performance distinctive from single atoms (SAs) and larger nanoparticles (NPs). However, the electrocatalytic performance of clusters, especially the size-activity relationship at the sub-nanoscale, is largely unexplored. Here, we synthesize a series of Ru nanocrystals from single atoms, subnanometric clusters to larger nanoparticles, aiming at investigating the size-dependent activity of hydrogen evolution in alkaline media. It is found that the d band center of Ru downshifts in a nearly linear relationship with the increase of diameter, and the subnanometric Ru clusters with d band center closer to Femi level display a stronger water dissociation ability and thus superior hydrogen evolution activity than SAs and larger nanoparticles. Benefiting from the high metal utilization and strong water dissociation ability, the Ru clusters manifest an ultrahigh turnover frequency of 43.3 s−1 at the overpotential of 100 mV, 36.1-fold larger than the commercial Pt/C.","Metal nanocluster properties undergo drastic activity alterations with slight size variations, although in-depth examinations of such changes are challenging to perform. Here, authors demonstrate Ru cluster size governs the d-band center position and electrocatalytic activity for H2 evolution.",2022-07-08
1508,Recurrent somatic mutations as predictors of immunotherapy response,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed the treatment of metastatic cancer but is hindered by variable response rates. A key unmet need is the identification of biomarkers that predict treatment response. To address this, we analyzed six whole exome sequencing cohorts with matched disease outcomes to identify genes and pathways predictive of ICB response. To increase detection power, we focus on genes and pathways that are significantly mutated following correction for epigenetic, replication timing, and sequence-based covariates. Using this technique, we identify several genes (BCLAF1, KRAS, BRAF, and TP53) and pathways (MAPK signaling, p53 associated, and immunomodulatory) as predictors of ICB response and develop the Cancer Immunotherapy Response CLassifiEr (CIRCLE). Compared to tumor mutational burden alone, CIRCLE led to superior prediction of ICB response with a 10.5% increase in sensitivity and a 11% increase in specificity. We envision that CIRCLE and more broadly the analysis of recurrently mutated cancer genes will pave the way for better prognostic tools for cancer immunotherapy.",Few genetic biomarkers are known for cancer immunotherapy. Here the authors identify recurrently-mutated genes and pathways associated with treatment response and develop a classifier using tumour whole exome sequencing and clinical features.,2022-07-08
1509,Observation of Néel-type skyrmions in acentric self-intercalated Cr1+δTe2,"Transition-metal dichalcogenides intercalated with 3d-transition metals within the van der Waals (vdW) gaps have been the focus of intense investigations owing to their fascinating structural and magnetic properties. At certain concentrations the intercalated atoms form ordered superstructures that exhibit ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic ordering. Here we show that the self-intercalated compound Cr1+δTe2 with δ ≈ 0.3 exhibits a new, so far unseen, three-dimensionally ordered (2×2×2) superstructure. Furthermore, high resolution X-ray diffraction reveals that there is an asymmetric occupation of the two inequivalent vdW gaps in the unit cell. The structure thus lacks inversion symmetry, which, thereby, allows for chiral non-collinear magnetic nanostructures. Indeed, Néel-type skyrmions are directly observed using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. The skyrmions are stable within the accessible temperature range (100–200 K) as well as in zero magnetic field. The diameter of the Néel skyrmions increases with lamella thickness and varies with applied magnetic field, indicating the role of long-range dipole fields. Our studies show that self-intercalation in vdW materials is a novel route to the formation of synthetic non-collinear spin textures.","Here, Saha et al. show that self-intercalation of e2Cr atoms in CrTe2 create an asymmetry in the number of atoms intercalated in the van der Waals gaps between the layers of CrTe2. This inversion symmetry breaking leads to non-collinear spin-textures and Néel-type magnetic skyrmions over a wide temperature range.",2022-07-08
1510,Signal-processing and adaptive prototissue formation in metabolic DNA protocells,"The fundamental life-defining processes in living cells, such as replication, division, adaptation, and tissue formation, occur via intertwined metabolic reaction networks that process signals for downstream effects with high precision in a confined, crowded environment. Hence, it is crucial to understand and reenact some of these functions in wholly synthetic cell-like entities (protocells) to envision designing soft materials with life-like traits. Herein, we report on all-DNA protocells composed of a liquid DNA interior and a hydrogel-like shell, harboring a catalytically active DNAzyme, that converts DNA signals into functional metabolites that lead to downstream adaptation processes via site-selective strand displacement reactions. The downstream processes include intra-protocellular phenotype-like changes, prototissue formation via multivalent interactions, and chemical messenger communication between active sender and dormant receiver cell populations for sorted heteroprototissue formation. The approach integrates several tools of DNA-nanoscience in a synchronized way to mimic life-like behavior in artificial systems for future interactive materials.","Signal processing for downstream functional and morphological adaptations is crucial for understanding and re-enacting features of living systems. Here, the authors show DNAzyme-containing, metabolic protocells that induce prototissue formation via chemical messenger communication due to in situ cleavage of upstream DNA signals.",2022-07-08
1511,Early life inflammation is associated with spinal cord excitability and nociceptive sensitivity in human infants,"Immune function and sensitivity to pain are closely related, but the association between early life inflammation and sensory nervous system development is poorly understood—especially in humans. Here, in term-born infants, we measure brain activity and reflex withdrawal activity (using EEG and EMG) and behavioural and physiological activity (using the PIPP-R score) to assess the impact of suspected early-onset neonatal infection on tactile- and noxious-evoked responses. We present evidence that neonatal inflammation (assessed by measuring C-reactive protein levels) is associated with increased spinal cord excitability and evoked brain activity following both tactile and noxious stimulation. There are early indications that this hyperalgesia could be maintained post-inflammation, supporting pre-clinical reports of early-life immune dysfunction influencing pain sensitivity in adults.","More than 1 in 10 babies born in the UK are suspected of having an infection. Here the authors show that newborn babies with signs of infection (raised C-Reactive Protein levels) have exaggerated leg reflexes and pain-related brain activity following a heel prick blood test, suggesting they may be more sensitive to pain.",2022-07-08
1512,An ancestral function of strigolactones as symbiotic rhizosphere signals,"In flowering plants, strigolactones (SLs) have dual functions as hormones that regulate growth and development, and as rhizosphere signaling molecules that induce symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Here, we report the identification of bryosymbiol (BSB), an SL from the bryophyte Marchantia paleacea. BSB is also found in vascular plants, indicating its origin in the common ancestor of land plants. BSB synthesis is enhanced at AM symbiosis permissive conditions and BSB deficient mutants are impaired in AM symbiosis. In contrast, the absence of BSB synthesis has little effect on the growth and gene expression. We show that the introduction of the SL receptor of Arabidopsis renders M. paleacea cells BSB-responsive. These results suggest that BSB is not perceived by M. paleacea cells due to the lack of cognate SL receptors. We propose that SLs originated as AM symbiosis-inducing rhizosphere signaling molecules and were later recruited as plant hormone.","Strigolactones (SLs) regulate angiosperm development and promote symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizae. Here the authors show that bryosymbiol, an SL present in bryophytes and angiosperms, promotes AM symbiosis in Marchantia paleacea suggesting an ancestral function of SLs as rhizosphere signals.",2022-07-08
1513,The contribution of common regulatory and protein-coding TYR variants to the genetic architecture of albinism,"Genetic diseases have been historically segregated into rare Mendelian disorders and common complex conditions. Large-scale studies using genome sequencing are eroding this distinction and are gradually unmasking the underlying complexity of human traits. Here, we analysed data from the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project and from a cohort of 1313 individuals with albinism aiming to gain insights into the genetic architecture of this archetypal rare disorder. We investigated the contribution of protein-coding and regulatory variants both rare and common. We focused on TYR, the gene encoding tyrosinase, and found that a high-frequency promoter variant, TYR c.−301C>T [rs4547091], modulates the penetrance of a prevalent, albinism-associated missense change, TYR c.1205G>A (p.Arg402Gln) [rs1126809]. We also found that homozygosity for a haplotype formed by three common, functionally-relevant variants, TYR c.[−301C;575C>A;1205G>A], is associated with a high probability of receiving an albinism diagnosis (OR>82). This genotype is also associated with reduced visual acuity and with increased central retinal thickness in UK Biobank participants. Finally, we report how the combined analysis of rare and common variants can increase diagnostic yield and can help inform genetic counselling in families with albinism.","Albinism is a rare disorder often caused by high-effect rare variants in the TYR gene. Here, the authors study a large albinism cohort and find that a common variant in the TYR promoter contributes to albinism by modifying the penetrance of other common variants, demonstrating a complex genetic architecture.",2022-07-08
1514,Cardiac disruption of SDHAF4-mediated mitochondrial complex II assembly promotes dilated cardiomyopathy,"Succinate dehydrogenase, which is known as mitochondrial complex II, has proven to be a fascinating machinery, attracting renewed and increased interest in its involvement in human diseases. Herein, we find that succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 4 (SDHAF4) is downregulated in cardiac muscle in response to pathological stresses and in diseased hearts from human patients. Cardiac loss of Sdhaf4 suppresses complex II assembly and results in subunit degradation and complex II deficiency in fetal mice. These defects are exacerbated in young adults with globally impaired metabolic capacity and activation of dynamin-related protein 1, which induces excess mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, thereby causing progressive dilated cardiomyopathy and lethal heart failure in animals. Targeting mitochondria via supplementation with fumarate or inhibiting mitochondrial fission improves mitochondrial dynamics, partially restores cardiac function and prolongs the lifespan of mutant mice. Moreover, the addition of fumarate is found to dramatically improve cardiac function in myocardial infarction mice. These findings reveal a vital role for complex II assembly in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and provide additional insights into therapeutic interventions for heart diseases.",Functional succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex is vital to mitochondrial homeostasis. Here the authors show that disruption of SDH assembly in the heart causes dilated cardiomyopathy via impairing the mitochondrial integrity and metabolism and that mitochondrial interventions can be an effective approach to ameliorate the disease progression.,2022-07-08
1515,Halide perovskites as disposable epitaxial templates for the phase-selective synthesis of lead sulfochloride nanocrystals,"Colloidal chemistry grants access to a wealth of materials through simple and mild reactions. However, even few elements can combine in a variety of stoichiometries and structures, potentially resulting in impurities or even wrong products. Similar issues have been long addressed in organic chemistry by using reaction-directing groups, that are added to a substrate to promote a specific product and are later removed. Inspired by such approach, we demonstrate the use of CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals to drive the phase-selective synthesis of two yet unexplored lead sulfochlorides: Pb3S2Cl2 and Pb4S3Cl2. When homogeneously nucleated in solution, lead sulfochlorides form Pb3S2Cl2 nanocrystals. Conversely, the presence of CsPbCl3 triggers the formation of Pb4S3Cl2/CsPbCl3 epitaxial heterostructures. The phase selectivity is guaranteed by the continuity of the cationic subnetwork across the interface, a condition not met in a hypothetical Pb3S2Cl2/CsPbCl3 heterostructure. The perovskite domain is then etched, delivering phase-pure Pb4S3Cl2 nanocrystals that could not be synthesized directly.","Phase-selective approaches, such using reaction-directing groups, are often seen in traditional organic chemistry and catalysis. Here authors use perovskite nanocrystals as disposable templates to drive the phase-selective synthesis of two colloidal nanomaterials, the lead sulfohalides Pb3S2Cl2 and Pb4S3Cl2.",2022-07-08
1516,The cholesterol uptake regulator PCSK9 promotes and is a therapeutic target in APC/KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer,"Therapeutic targeting of KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) is an unmet need. Here, we show that Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PSCK9) promotes APC/KRAS-mutant CRC and is a therapeutic target. Using CRC patient cohorts, isogenic cell lines and transgenic mice, we identify that de novo cholesterol biosynthesis is induced in APC/KRAS mutant CRC, accompanied by increased geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP)─a metabolite necessary for KRAS activation. PCSK9 is the top up-regulated cholesterol-related gene. PCSK9 depletion represses APC/KRAS-mutant CRC cell growth in vitro and in vivo, whereas PCSK9 overexpression induces oncogenesis. Mechanistically, PCSK9 reduces cholesterol uptake but induces cholesterol de novo biosynthesis and GGPP accumulation. GGPP is a pivotal metabolite downstream of PCSK9 by activating KRAS/MEK/ERK signaling. PCSK9 inhibitors suppress growth of APC/KRAS-mutant CRC cells, organoids and xenografts, especially in combination with simvastatin. PCSK9 overexpression predicts poor survival of APC/KRAS-mutant CRC patients. Together, cholesterol homeostasis regulator PCSK9 promotes APC/KRAS-mutant CRC via GGPP-KRAS/MEK/ERK axis and is a therapeutic target.","Looking for metabolic-associated vulnerabilities is a promising approach for therapeutic intervention in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer. Here, the authors show that the cholesterol-uptake regulator PCSK9 drives tumourigenesis and is a therapeutic target in KRASmutant colorectal cancer.",2022-07-08
1517,Imbalanced gut microbiota fuels hepatocellular carcinoma development by shaping the hepatic inflammatory microenvironment,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and therapeutic options for advanced HCC are limited. Here, we observe that intestinal dysbiosis affects antitumor immune surveillance and drives liver disease progression towards cancer. Dysbiotic microbiota, as seen in Nlrp6−/− mice, induces a Toll-like receptor 4 dependent expansion of hepatic monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mMDSC) and suppression of T-cell abundance. This phenotype is transmissible via fecal microbiota transfer and reversible upon antibiotic treatment, pointing to the high plasticity of the tumor microenvironment. While loss of Akkermansia muciniphila correlates with mMDSC abundance, its reintroduction restores intestinal barrier function and strongly reduces liver inflammation and fibrosis. Cirrhosis patients display increased bacterial abundance in hepatic tissue, which induces pronounced transcriptional changes, including activation of fibro-inflammatory pathways as well as circuits mediating cancer immunosuppression. This study demonstrates that gut microbiota closely shapes the hepatic inflammatory microenvironment opening approaches for cancer prevention and therapy.","Steatohepatitis is a chronic hepatic inflammation associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma progression. Here the authors show that intestinal dysbiosis in mice lacking the inflammasome sensor molecule NLRP6 aggravates steatohepatitis and accelerates liver cancer progression, a process that can be delayed by antibiotic treatment.",2022-07-08
1518,Visual timing-tuned responses in human association cortices and response dynamics in early visual cortex,"Quantifying the timing (duration and frequency) of brief visual events is vital to human perception, multisensory integration and action planning. Tuned neural responses to visual event timing have been found in association cortices, in areas implicated in these processes. Here we ask how these timing-tuned responses are related to the responses of early visual cortex, which monotonically increase with event duration and frequency. Using 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging and neural model-based analyses, we find a gradual transition from monotonically increasing to timing-tuned neural responses beginning in the medial temporal area (MT/V5). Therefore, across successive stages of visual processing, timing-tuned response components gradually become dominant over inherent sensory response modulation by event timing. This additional timing-tuned response component is independent of retinotopic location. We propose that this hierarchical emergence of timing-tuned responses from sensory processing areas quantifies sensory event timing while abstracting temporal representations from spatial properties of their inputs.","Early visual cortical responses increase with event duration and frequency, while later timing-tuned responses quantify event timing. Here, the authors show timing tuning gradually emerges up the visual hierarchy, and separates temporal and spatial event features.",2022-07-08
1519,Late quaternary biotic homogenization of North American mammalian faunas,"Biotic homogenization—increasing similarity of species composition among ecological communities—has been linked to anthropogenic processes operating over the last century. Fossil evidence, however, suggests that humans have had impacts on ecosystems for millennia. We quantify biotic homogenization of North American mammalian assemblages during the late Pleistocene through Holocene (~30,000 ybp to recent), a timespan encompassing increased evidence of humans on the landscape (~20,000–14,000 ybp). From ~10,000 ybp to recent, assemblages became significantly more homogenous (>100% increase in Jaccard similarity), a pattern that cannot be explained by changes in fossil record sampling. Homogenization was most pronounced among mammals larger than 1 kg and occurred in two phases. The first followed the megafaunal extinction at ~10,000 ybp. The second, more rapid phase began during human population growth and early agricultural intensification (~2,000–1,000 ybp). We show that North American ecosystems were homogenizing for millennia, extending human impacts back ~10,000 years.","Biotic homogenization, which is increased similarity in the composition of species among communities, is rising due to human activities. Using North American mammal fossil records from the past 30,000 years, this study shows that this phenomenon is ancient, beginning between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago with the extinction of the mammal megafauna.",2022-07-08
1520,A charge transfer framework that describes supramolecular interactions governing structure and properties of 2D perovskites,"The elucidation of structure-to-function relationships for two-dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites remains a primary challenge for engineering efficient perovskite-based devices. By combining insights from theory and experiment, we describe the introduction of bifunctional ligands that are capable of making strong hydrogen bonds within the organic bilayer. We find that stronger intermolecular interactions draw charge away from the perovskite layers, and we have formulated a simple and intuitive computational descriptor, the charge separation descriptor (CSD), that accurately describes the relationship between the Pb-I-Pb angle, band gap, and in-plane charge transport with the strength of these interactions. A higher CSD value correlates to less distortion of the Pb-I-Pb angle, a reduced band gap, and higher in-plane mobility of the perovskite. These improved material properties result in improved device characteristics of the resulting solar cells.","Understanding structure-property relationships is important when designing functional materials. Here, authors propose a descriptor to help understand and predict the electronic properties of two-dimensional lead iodide perovskites for photovoltaic applications.",2022-07-08
1521,Mimicked synthetic ribosomal protein complex for benchmarking crosslinking mass spectrometry workflows,"Cross-linking mass spectrometry has matured to a frequently used tool for the investigation of protein structures as well as interactome studies up to a system-wide level. The growing community generated a broad spectrum of applications, linker types, acquisition strategies and specialized data analysis tools, which makes it challenging to decide for an appropriate analysis workflow. Here, we report a large and flexible synthetic peptide library as reliable instrument to benchmark crosslink workflows. Additionally, we provide a tool, IMP-X-FDR, that calculates the real, experimentally validated, FDR, compares results across search engine platforms and analyses crosslink properties in an automated manner. We apply the library with 6 commonly used linker reagents and analyse the data with 6 established search engines. We thereby show that the correct algorithm and search setting choice is highly important to improve identification rate and reliability. We reach identification rates of up to ~70 % of the theoretical maximum (i.e. 700 unique lysine-lysine cross-links) while maintaining a real false-discovery-rate of <3 % at cross-link level with high reproducibility, representatively showing that our test system delivers valuable and statistically solid results.","Cross-linking mass spectrometry is widely used to elucidate protein structures and interactions. Here, the authors generate an extensive peptide library to benchmark the most common cross-link search engines with frequently used cross-linking reagents in low and high complex sample systems.",2022-07-08
1522,Cryo-EM structures of recombinant human sodium-potassium pump determined in three different states,"Sodium-Potassium Pump (Na+/K+-ATPase, NKA) is an ion pump that generates an electrochemical gradient of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane by hydrolyzing ATP. During each Post-Albers cycle, NKA exchanges three cytoplasmic sodium ions for two extracellular potassium ions through alternating changes between the E1 and E2 states. Hitherto, several steps remained unknown during the complete working cycle of NKA. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of recombinant human NKA (hNKA) in three distinct states at 2.7–3.2 Å resolution, representing the E1·3Na and E1·3Na·ATP states with cytosolic gates open and the basic E2·[2K] state, respectively. This work provides the insights into the cytoplasmic Na+ entrance pathway and the mechanism of cytoplasmic gate closure coupled with ATP hydrolysis, filling crucial gaps in the structural elucidation of the Post-Albers cycle of NKA.","Sodium-Potassium Pump (Na+/K+-ATPase, NKA) generates an electrochemical gradient of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane by hydrolyzing ATP.

1523,PRMT5 activates AKT via methylation to promote tumor metastasis,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is the primary methyltransferase generating symmetric-dimethyl-arginine marks on histone and non-histone proteins. PRMT5 dysregulation is implicated in multiple oncogenic processes. Here, we report that PRMT5-mediated methylation of protein kinase B (AKT) is required for its subsequent phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473. Moreover, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PRMT5 abolishes AKT1 arginine 15 methylation, thereby preventing AKT1 translocation to the plasma membrane and subsequent recruitment of its upstream activating kinases PDK1 and mTOR2. We show that PRMT5/AKT signaling controls the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition transcription factors ZEB1, SNAIL, and TWIST1. PRMT5 inhibition significantly attenuates primary tumor growth and broadly blocks metastasis in multiple organs in xenograft tumor models of high-risk neuroblastoma. Collectively, our results suggest that PRMT5 inhibition augments anti-AKT or other downstream targeted therapeutics in high-risk metastatic cancers.","‘Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is known to regulate the expression of genes involved in metastasis. Here, the authors show that PRMT5 methylates Akt and methylation is required for phosphorylation and activation of Akt; ultimately leading to the increase in expression of pro-metastatic transcription factors.",2022-07-08
1524,A luciferase prosubstrate and a red bioluminescent calcium indicator for imaging neuronal activity in mice,"Although fluorescent indicators have been broadly utilized for monitoring bioactivities, fluorescence imaging, when applied to mammals, is limited to superficial targets or requires invasive surgical procedures. Thus, there is emerging interest in developing bioluminescent indicators for noninvasive mammalian imaging. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of neuronal activity is highly desired but hindered by insufficient photons needed to digitalize fast brain activities. In this work, we develop a luciferase prosubstrate deliverable at an increased dose and activated in vivo by nonspecific esterase. We further engineer a bright, bioluminescent indicator with robust responsiveness to calcium ions (Ca2+) and appreciable emission above 600 nm. Integration of these advantageous components enables the imaging of the activity of neuronal ensembles in awake mice minimally invasively with excellent signal-to-background and subsecond temporal resolution. This study thus establishes a paradigm for studying brain function in health and disease.",Bioluminescence imaging of neuronal activity is desired. Here the authors report a luciferase prosubstrate activatable in vivo by nonspecific esterase and engineer a bioluminescent indicator with responsiveness to calcium ions: integration of these components enabled imaging of neuronal activity in mice.,2022-07-08
1525,Upper airway gene expression shows a more robust adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in children,"Unlike other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 disproportionately causes severe disease in older adults whereas disease burden in children is lower. To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response may contribute to this disparity, we compare nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 older adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes is robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrate markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including response to TNF and production of IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-4. Cell type deconvolution confirms greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibit a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, among the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and especially adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.","The difference between children and adults in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not clearly established. Here the authors use gene expression analysis of nasopharyngeal samples from children and adults and show a higher level of immune response in children compared to adults, including of B and T cell activation.",2022-07-08
1526,Mast4 determines the cell fate of MSCs for bone and cartilage development,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) differentiation into different lineages is precisely controlled by signaling pathways. Given that protein kinases play a crucial role in signal transduction, here we show that Microtubule Associated Serine/Threonine Kinase Family Member 4 (Mast4) serves as an important mediator of TGF-β and Wnt signal transduction in regulating chondro-osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Suppression of Mast4 by TGF-β1 led to increased Sox9 stability by blocking Mast4-induced Sox9 serine 494 phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation, ultimately enhancing chondrogenesis of MSCs. On the other hand, Mast4 protein, which stability was enhanced by Wnt-mediated inhibition of GSK-3β and subsequent Smurf1 recruitment, promoted β-catenin nuclear localization and Runx2 activity, increasing osteogenesis of MSCs. Consistently, Mast4−/− mice demonstrated excessive cartilage synthesis, while exhibiting osteoporotic phenotype. Interestingly, Mast4 depletion in MSCs facilitated cartilage formation and regeneration in vivo. Altogether, our findings uncover essential roles of Mast4 in determining the fate of MSC development into cartilage or bone.","Controlling fate decision of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) is important for their clinical application. Here the authors demonstrate that TGF-β-induced Mast4 suppression and Wnt-mediated Mast4 stabilization regulate MSC differentiation into cartilage and bone, respectively.",2022-07-08
1527,Inherited MUTYH mutations cause elevated somatic mutation rates and distinctive mutational signatures in normal human cells,"Cellular DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species is repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway which includes the DNA glycosylase MUTYH. Inherited biallelic MUTYH mutations cause predisposition to colorectal adenomas and carcinoma. However, the mechanistic progression from germline MUTYH mutations to MUTYH-Associated Polyposis (MAP) is incompletely understood. Here, we sequence normal tissue DNAs from 10 individuals with MAP. Somatic base substitution mutation rates in intestinal epithelial cells were elevated 2 to 4-fold in all individuals, except for one showing a 31-fold increase, and were also increased in other tissues. The increased mutation burdens were of multiple mutational signatures characterised by C > A changes. Different mutation rates and signatures between individuals are likely due to different MUTYH mutations or additional inherited mutations in other BER pathway genes. The elevated base substitution rate in normal cells likely accounts for the predisposition to neoplasia in MAP. Despite ubiquitously elevated mutation rates, individuals with MAP do not display overt evidence of premature ageing. Thus, accumulation of somatic mutations may not be sufficient to cause the global organismal functional decline of ageing.","Inherited mutations in MUTYH have been shown to predispose patients to colorectal cancers. Here, the authors show that MUTYH mutations lead to an increased somatic base substitution mutation rate in normal intestinal epithelial cells, which is the likely cause for the increased cancer risk.",2022-07-08
1528,Contrasting behaviour under pressure reveals the reasons for pyramidalization in tris(amido)uranium(III) and tris(arylthiolate) uranium(III) molecules,"A range of reasons has been suggested for why many low-coordinate complexes across the periodic table exhibit a geometry that is bent, rather a higher symmetry that would best separate the ligands. The dominating reason or reasons are still debated. Here we show that two pyramidal UX3 molecules, in which X is a bulky anionic ligand, show opposite behaviour upon pressurisation in the solid state. UN″3 (UN3, N″ = N(SiMe3)2) increases in pyramidalization between ambient pressure and 4.08 GPa, while U(SAr)3 (US3, SAr = S-C6H2-tBu3−2,4,6) undergoes pressure-induced planarization. This capacity for planarization enables the use of X-ray structural and computational analyses to explore the four hypotheses normally put forward for this pyramidalization. The pyramidality of UN3, which increases with pressure, is favoured by increased dipole and reduction in molecular volume, the two factors outweighing the slight increase in metal-ligand agostic interactions that would be formed if it was planar. The ambient pressure pyramidal geometry of US3 is favoured by the induced dipole moment and agostic bond formation but these are weaker drivers than in UN3; the pressure-induced planarization of US3 is promoted by the lower molecular volume of US3 when it is planar compared to when it is pyramidal.","The reasons for which many low-coordinate complexes exhibit bent geometry, rather than a higher symmetry, are still under debate. Here, the authors use high-pressure crystallography to examine whether low-coordinate f-block molecules become more planar or pyramidal under pressure; which happens is dictated by the dipole moment of the complex and the volume of the planar form.",2022-07-07
1529,Fluorescence turn on amine detection in a cationic covalent organic framework,"Ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) are new examples of porous materials and have shown great potential for various applications. When functionalized with suitable emission sites, guest uptake via the ionic moieties of iCOFs can cause a significant change in luminescence, making them excellent candidates for chemosensors. In here, we present a luminescence sensor in the form of an ionic covalent organic framework (TGH+•PD) composed of guanidinium and phenanthroline moieties for the detection of ammonia and primary aliphatic amines. TGH+•PD exhibits strong emission enhancement in the presence of selective primary amines due to the suppression of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) with an ultra-low detection limit of 1.2 × 10‒7 M for ammonia. The presence of ionic moieties makes TGH+•PD highly dispersible in water, while deprotonation of the guanidinium moiety by amines restricts its ICT process and signals their presence by enhanced fluorescence emission. The presence of ordered pore walls introduces size selectivity among analyte molecules, and the iCOF has been successfully used to monitor meat products that release biogenic amine vapors upon decomposition due to improper storage.","Ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) are new examples of porous materials and show great potential for various applications. Here, the authors demonstrate functionalization of an iCOFs with suitable emission sites and application as chemosensor for amine detection with high sensitivity which can be used to monitor meat spoilage.",2022-07-07
1530,Audiovisual adaptation is expressed in spatial and decisional codes,The brain adapts dynamically to the changing sensory statistics of its environment. Recent research has started to delineate the neural circuitries and representations that support this cross-sensory plasticity. Combining psychophysics and model-based representational fMRI and EEG we characterized how the adult human brain adapts to misaligned audiovisual signals. We show that audiovisual adaptation is associated with changes in regional BOLD-responses and fine-scale activity patterns in a widespread network from Heschl’s gyrus to dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Audiovisual recalibration relies on distinct spatial and decisional codes that are expressed with opposite gradients and time courses across the auditory processing hierarchy. Early activity patterns in auditory cortices encode sounds in a continuous space that flexibly adapts to misaligned visual inputs. Later activity patterns in frontoparietal cortices code decisional uncertainty consistent with these spatial transformations. Our findings suggest that regions within the auditory processing hierarchy multiplex spatial and decisional codes to adapt flexibly to the changing sensory statistics in the environment.,"The brain adapts dynamically to the statistics of its environment. Here, the authors use psychophysics and model-based representational fMRI and EEG to show that audiovisual recalibration relies on distinct spatial and decisional codes that are expressed with opposite gradients and time courses across the auditory processing hierarchy.",2022-07-07
1531,Biomimetic generation of the strongest known biomaterial found in limpet tooth,"The biomaterial with the highest known tensile strength is a unique composite of chitin and goethite (α-FeO(OH)) present in teeth from the Common Limpet (Patella vulgata). A biomimetic based on limpet tooth, with corresponding high-performance mechanical properties is highly desirable. Here we report on the replication of limpet tooth developmental processes ex vivo, where isolated limpet tissue and cells in culture generate new biomimetic structures. Transcriptomic analysis of each developmental stage of the radula, the organ from which limpet teeth originate, identifies sequential changes in expression of genes related to chitin and iron processing. We quantify iron and chitin metabolic processes in the radula and grow isolated radula cells in vitro. Bioinspired material can be developed with electrospun chitin mineralised by conditioned media from cultured radula cells. Our results inform molecular processes behind the generation of limpet tooth and establish a platform for development of a novel biomimetic with comparable properties.","The highest tensile strength biomaterial known exists in limpet teeth and replicating this material is of interest.

1532,Light sources with bias tunable spectrum based on van der Waals interface transistors,"Light-emitting electronic devices are ubiquitous in key areas of current technology, such as data communications, solid-state lighting, displays, and optical interconnects. Controlling the spectrum of the emitted light electrically, by simply acting on the device bias conditions, is an important goal with potential technological repercussions. However, identifying a material platform enabling broad electrical tuning of the spectrum of electroluminescent devices remains challenging. Here, we propose light-emitting field-effect transistors based on van der Waals interfaces of atomically thin semiconductors as a promising class of devices to achieve this goal. We demonstrate that large spectral changes in room-temperature electroluminescence can be controlled both at the device assembly stage –by suitably selecting the material forming the interfaces– and on-chip, by changing the bias to modify the device operation point. Even though the precise relation between device bias and kinetics of the radiative transitions remains to be understood, our experiments show that the physical mechanism responsible for light emission is robust, making these devices compatible with simple large areas device production methods.","Here, the authors report the realization of light-emitting field-effect transistors based on van der Waals heterostructures with conduction and valence band edges at the Γ-point of the Brillouin zone, showing electrically tunable and material-dependent electroluminescence spectra at room temperature.",2022-07-07
1533,Biophysical impacts of northern vegetation changes on seasonal warming patterns,"The seasonal greening of Northern Hemisphere (NH) ecosystems, due to extended growing periods and enhanced photosynthetic activity, could modify near-surface warming by perturbing land-atmosphere energy exchanges, yet this biophysical control on warming seasonality is underexplored. By performing experiments with a coupled land-atmosphere model, here we show that summer greening effectively dampens NH warming by −0.15 ± 0.03 °C for 1982–2014 due to enhanced evapotranspiration. However, greening generates weak temperature changes in spring (+0.02 ± 0.06 °C) and autumn (−0.05 ± 0.05 °C), because the evaporative cooling is counterbalanced by radiative warming from albedo and water vapor feedbacks. The dwindling evaporative cooling towards cool seasons is also supported by state-of-the-art Earth system models. Moreover, greening-triggered energy imbalance is propagated forward by atmospheric circulation to subsequent seasons and causes sizable time-lagged climate effects. Overall, greening makes winter warmer and summer cooler, attenuating the seasonal amplitude of NH temperature. These findings demonstrate complex tradeoffs and linkages of vegetation-climate feedbacks among seasons.","The seasonal greening of Northern Hemisphere ecosystems due to extended growing periods and enhanced photosynthetic activity is, via experiments, shown to modify near-surface warming by perturbing land-atmosphere energy exchanges.",2022-07-07
1534,Multi-scale computer-aided design and photo-controlled macromolecular synthesis boosting uranium harvesting from seawater,"By integrating multi-scale computational simulation with photo-regulated macromolecular synthesis, this study presents a new paradigm for smart design while customizing polymeric adsorbents for uranium harvesting from seawater. A dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) approach, combined with a molecular dynamics (MD) study, is performed to simulate the conformational dynamics and adsorption process of a model uranium grabber, i.e., PAOm-b-PPEGMAn, suggesting that the maximum adsorption capacity with atomic economy can be achieved with a preferred block ratio of 0.18. The designed polymers are synthesized using the PET-RAFT polymerization in a microfluidic platform, exhibiting a record high adsorption capacity of uranium (11.4 ± 1.2 mg/g) in real seawater within 28 days. This study offers an integrated perspective to quantitatively assess adsorption phenomena of polymers, bridging metal-ligand interactions at the molecular level with their spatial conformations at the mesoscopic level. The established protocol is generally adaptable for target-oriented development of more advanced polymers for broadened applications.","Developing materials for uranium harvesting from seawater with high adsorption capacity remains challenging. Here, the authors develop a new protocol, by combining multi-scale computational simulations with the PET-RAFT polymerization, for rational design and precise synthesis of block copolymers with optimal architectures and atomic economy, achieving a capacity of 11.4 mg/g within 28 days.",2022-07-07

Here we present a synthetic biology framework for assaying Mtb drug targets in engineered E. coli. We construct Target Essential Surrogate E. coli (TESEC) in which an essential metabolic enzyme is deleted and replaced with an Mtb-derived functional analog, linking bacterial growth to the activity of the target enzyme. High throughput screening of a TESEC model for Mtb alanine racemase (Alr) revealed benazepril as a targeted inhibitor, a result validated in whole-cell Mtb. In vitro biochemical assays indicated a noncompetitive mechanism unlike that of clinical Alr inhibitors. We establish the scalability of TESEC for drug discovery by characterizing TESEC strains for four additional targets.",Whole-cell screening for Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibitors is complicated by the pathogen’s slow growth and biocontainment requirements.

1536,Ultrahigh transverse thermoelectric power factor in flexible Weyl semimetal WTe2,"Topological semimetals are well known for their interesting physical properties, while their mechanical properties have rarely received attention. With the increasing demand for flexible electronics, we explore the great potential of the van der Waals bonded Weyl semimetal WTe2 for flexible thermoelectric applications. We find that WTe2 single crystals have an ultrahigh Nernst power factor of ~3 Wm−1K−2, which outperforms the conventional Seebeck power factors of the state-of-the-art thermoelectric semiconductors by 2–3 orders of magnitude. A unique band structure that hosts compensated electrons and holes with extremely high mobilities is the primary mechanism for this huge Nernst power factor. Moreover, a large Ettingshausen signal of ~5 × 10−5 KA−1m is observed at 23.1 K and 9 T. In this work, the combination of the exceptional Nernst–Ettingshausen performance and excellent mechanical transformative ability of WTe2 would be instructive for flexible micro-/nano-thermoelectric devices.","Flexible thermoelectrics are of great interest with increasing demand of flexible and wearable electronics. Here, the authors demonstrate that the Weyl semimetal, WTe2, has a high Nernst power factor and great mechanical flexibility.",2022-07-07
1537,Inhibitory role of Annexin A1 in pathological bone resorption and therapeutic implications in periprosthetic osteolysis,"There is currently no therapy available for periprosthetic osteolysis, the most common cause of arthroplasty failure. Here, the role of AnxA1 in periprosthetic osteolysis and potential therapeutics were investigated. Reducing the expression of AnxA1 in calvarial tissue was found to be associated with increased osteolytic lesions and the osteolytic lesions induced by debris implantation were more severe in AnxA1-defecient mice than in wild-type mice. AnxA1 inhibits the differentiation of osteoclasts through suppressing NFκB signaling and promoting the PPAR-γ pathway. Administration of N-terminal-AnxA1 (Ac2-26 peptide) onto calvariae significantly reduced osteolytic lesions triggered by wear debris. These therapeutic effects were abrogated in mice that had received the PPAR-γ antagonist, suggesting that the AnxA1/PPAR-γ axis has an inhibitory role in osteolysis. The administration of Ac2–26 suppressed osteolysis induced by TNF-α and RANKL injections in mice. These findings indicate that AnxA1 is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of periprosthetic osteolysis.",Periprosthetic osteolysis is a cause of arthroplasty failure without available therapies. Here the authors show that Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is involved in in periprosthetic osteolysis and exerts potential therapeutic effects through suppressing NFκB signaling and promoting the PPAR-γ pathway resulting in inhibition of inflammation and osteoclasts differentiation induced by wear debris.,2022-07-07
1538,A plasmid system with tunable copy number,"Plasmids are one of the most commonly used platforms for genetic engineering and recombinant gene expression in bacteria. The range of available copy numbers for cloning vectors is largely restricted to the handful of Origins of Replication (ORIs) that have been isolated from plasmids found in nature. Here, we introduce two systems that allow for the continuous, finely-tuned control of plasmid copy number between 1 and 800 copies per cell: a plasmid with an anhydrotetracycline-controlled copy number, and a parallelized assay that is used to generate a continuous spectrum of 1194 ColE1-based copy number variants. Using these systems, we investigate the effects of plasmid copy number on cellular growth rates, gene expression, biosynthesis, and genetic circuit performance. We perform single-cell timelapse measurements to characterize plasmid loss, runaway plasmid replication, and quantify the impact of plasmid copy number on the variability of gene expression. Using our assay, we find that each plasmid imposes a 0.063% linear metabolic burden on their hosts, hinting at a simple relationship between metabolic burdens and plasmid DNA synthesis. Our systems enable the precise control of gene expression, and our results highlight the importance of tuning plasmid copy number as a powerful tool for the optimization of synthetic biological systems.","The range of available copy numbers for cloning vectors is largely restricted to the handful of ORIs that have been isolated from plasmids found in nature.

1539,Nucleotide mismatches prevent intrinsic self-silencing of hpRNA transgenes to enhance RNAi stability in plants,"Hairpin RNA (hpRNA) transgenes are the most successful RNA interference (RNAi) method in plants. Here, we show that hpRNA transgenes are invariably methylated in the inverted-repeat (IR) DNA and the adjacent promoter, causing transcriptional self-silencing. Nucleotide substitutions in the sense sequence, disrupting the IR structure, prevent the intrinsic DNA methylation resulting in more uniform and persistent RNAi. Substituting all cytosine with thymine nucleotides, in a G:U hpRNA design, prevents self-silencing but still allows for the formation of hpRNA due to G:U wobble base-pairing. The G:U design induces effective RNAi in 90–96% of transgenic lines, compared to 57–65% for the traditional hpRNA design. While a traditional hpRNA transgene shows increasing self-silencing from cotyledons to true leaves, its G:U counterpart avoids this and induce RNAi throughout plant growth. Furthermore, siRNAs from G:U and traditional hpRNA show different characteristics and appear to function via different pathways to induce target DNA methylation.","Long hairpin RNA (hpRNA) transgenes are the most widely used RNAi technology in plants, but are potentially subject to self-induced transcriptional silencing. Here, the authors show nucleotide mismatches prevent intrinsic self-silencing of hpRNA transgenes in Arabidopsis and tobacco.",2022-07-07
1540,A cryptic third active site in cyanophycin synthetase creates primers for polymerization,"Cyanophycin is a nitrogen reserve biopolymer in many bacteria that has promising industrial applications. Made by cyanophycin synthetase 1 (CphA1), it has a poly-L-Asp backbone with L-Arg residues attached to each aspartate sidechain. CphA1s are thought to typically require existing segments of cyanophycin to act as primers for cyanophycin polymerization. In this study, we show that most CphA1s will not require exogenous primers and discover the surprising cause of primer independence: CphA1 can make minute quantities of cyanophycin without primer, and an unexpected, cryptic metallopeptidase-like active site in the N-terminal domain of many CphA1s digests these into primers, solving the problem of primer availability. We present co-complex cryo-EM structures, make mutations that transition CphA1s between primer dependence and independence, and demonstrate that primer dependence can be a limiting factor for cyanophycin production in heterologous hosts. In CphA1, domains with opposite catalytic activities combine into a remarkable, self-sufficient, biosynthetic nanomachine.",Cyanophycin synthetase CphA1 polymerizes Asp and Arg into the nitrogen reserve polymer cyanophycin using two active sites.

1541,Highly robust and soft biohybrid mechanoluminescence for optical signaling and illumination,"Biohybrid is a newly emerging and promising approach to construct soft robotics and soft machines with novel functions, high energy efficiency, great adaptivity and intelligence. Despite many unique advantages of biohybrid systems, it is well known that most biohybrid systems have a relatively short lifetime, require complex fabrication process, and only remain functional with careful maintenance. Herein, we introduce a simple method to create a highly robust and power-free soft biohybrid mechanoluminescence, by encapsulating dinoflagellates, bioluminescent unicellular marine algae, into soft elastomeric chambers. The dinoflagellates retain their intrinsic bioluminescence, which is a near-instantaneous light response to mechanical forces. We demonstrate the robustness of various geometries of biohybrid mechanoluminescent devices, as well as potential applications such as visualizing external mechanical perturbations, deformation-induced illumination, and optical signaling in a dark environment. Our biohybrid mechanoluminescent devices are ultra-sensitive with fast response time and can maintain their light emission capability for weeks without special maintenance.","Despite the advantages of biohybrid systems for soft robotics, most systems have short lifetime, require complex fabrication, and only remain functional with careful maintenance.

1542,Characterization of core fucosylation via sequential enzymatic treatments of intact glycopeptides and mass spectrometry analysis,"Core fucosylation of N-linked glycoproteins has been linked to the functions of glycoproteins in physiological and pathological processes. However, quantitative characterization of core fucosylation remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of N-linked glycosylation. Here we report a mass spectrometry-based method that employs sequential treatment of intact glycopeptides with enzymes (STAGE) to analyze site-specific core fucosylation of glycoproteins. The STAGE method utilizes Endo F3 followed by PNGase F treatment to generate mass signatures for glycosites that are formerly modified by core fucosylated N-linked glycans. We benchmark the STAGE method and use it to characterize site specific core fucosylation of glycoproteins from human hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, resulting in the identification of 1130 and 782 core fucosylated glycosites, respectively. These results indicate that our STAGE method enables quantitative characterization of core fucosylation events from complex protein mixtures, which may benefit our understanding of core fucosylation functions in various diseases.","Core fucosylation of N-linked glycoproteins has been linked to physiological and pathological processes.

1543,Nanoscale organization of two-dimensional multimeric pMHC reagents with DNA origami for CD8+ T cell detection,"Peptide-MHC (pMHC) multimers have excelled in the detection of antigen-specific T cells and have allowed phenotypic analysis using other reagents, but their use for detection of low-affinity T cells remains a challenge. Here we develop a multimeric T cell identifying reagent platform using two-dimensional DNA origami scaffolds to spatially organize pMHCs (termed as dorimers) with nanoscale control. We show that these dorimers enhance the binding avidity for low-affinity antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs). The dorimers are able to detect more antigen-specific T cells in mouse CD8+ T cells and early-stage CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes that express less dense TCRs, compared with the equivalent tetramers and dextramers. Moreover, we demonstrate dorimer function in the analysis of autoimmune CD8+ T cells that express low-affinity TCRs, which are difficult to detect using tetramers. We anticipate that dorimers could contribute to the investigation of antigen-specific T cells in immune T cell function or immunotherapy applications.",MHC-peptide multimers are important reagents for detecting antigen specific T cells. Here the authors show that DNA scaffolds can be used to make MHC-peptide multimers and the avidity controlled so that low abundance or T cells with low affinity TCR can be detected using these reagents.,2022-07-07
1544,TET1 dioxygenase is required for FOXA2-associated chromatin remodeling in pancreatic beta-cell differentiation,"Existing knowledge of the role of epigenetic modifiers in pancreas development has exponentially increased. However, the function of TET dioxygenases in pancreatic endocrine specification remains obscure. We set out to tackle this issue using a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation system, in which TET1/TET2/TET3 triple knockout cells display severe defects in pancreatic β-cell specification. The integrative whole-genome analysis identifies unique cell-type-specific hypermethylated regions (hyper-DMRs) displaying reduced chromatin activity and remarkable enrichment of FOXA2, a pioneer transcription factor essential for pancreatic endoderm specification. Intriguingly, TET depletion leads to significant changes in FOXA2 binding at the pancreatic progenitor stage, in which gene loci with decreased FOXA2 binding feature low levels of active chromatin modifications and enriches for bHLH motifs. Transduction of full-length TET1 but not the TET1-catalytic-domain in TET-deficient cells effectively rescues β-cell differentiation accompanied by restoring PAX4 hypomethylation. Taking these findings together with the defective generation of functional β-cells upon TET1-inactivation, our study unveils an essential role of TET1-dependent demethylation in establishing β-cell identity. Moreover, we discover a physical interaction between TET1 and FOXA2 in endodermal lineage intermediates, which provides a mechanistic clue regarding the complex crosstalk between TET dioxygenases and pioneer transcription factors in epigenetic regulation during pancreas specification.","Here the authors show that TET1 is required for the generation of functional insulin-producing cells, FOXA2 physically interacts with TET1 and contributes to specific recruitment of TET1 to mediate chromatin opening at the regulatory elements of pancreatic lineage determinants.",2022-07-07
1545,Sex-specific regulation of inhibition and network activity by local aromatase in the mouse hippocampus,"Cognitive function relies on a balanced interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons (INs), but the impact of estradiol on IN function is not fully understood. Here, we characterize the regulation of hippocampal INs by aromatase, the enzyme responsible for estradiol synthesis, using a combination of molecular, genetic, functional and behavioral tools. The results show that CA1 parvalbumin-expressing INs (PV-INs) contribute to brain estradiol synthesis. Brain aromatase regulates synaptic inhibition through a mechanism that involves modification of perineuronal nets enwrapping PV-INs. In the female brain, aromatase modulates PV-INs activity, the dynamics of network oscillations and hippocampal-dependent memory. Aromatase regulation of PV-INs and inhibitory synapses is determined by the gonads and independent of sex chromosomes. These results suggest PV-INs are mediators of estrogenic regulation of behaviorally-relevant activity.","Using a combination of molecular, genetic, functional and behavioural tools, this study describes the impact of brain synthesized estrogen in inhibitory neuronal function, network oscillations and hippocampal dependent memory.",2022-07-07
1546,Modulating mitofusins to control mitochondrial function and signaling,"Mitofusins reside on the outer mitochondrial membrane and regulate mitochondrial fusion, a physiological process that impacts diverse cellular processes. Mitofusins are activated by conformational changes and subsequently oligomerize to enable mitochondrial fusion. Here, we identify small molecules that directly increase or inhibit mitofusins activity by modulating mitofusin conformations and oligomerization. We use these small molecules to better understand the role of mitofusins activity in mitochondrial fusion, function, and signaling. We find that mitofusin activation increases, whereas mitofusin inhibition decreases mitochondrial fusion and functionality. Remarkably, mitofusin inhibition also induces minority mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization followed by sub-lethal caspase-3/7 activation, which in turn induces DNA damage and upregulates DNA damage response genes. In this context, apoptotic death induced by a second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetic is potentiated by mitofusin inhibition. These data provide mechanistic insights into the function and regulation of mitofusins as well as small molecules to pharmacologically target mitofusins.","Mitofusins regulate mitochondrial fusion. Here the authors identify small molecules that activate or inhibit mitofusins’ activity and modulate mitochondrial fusion and functionality. Inhibition of mitochondrial fusion promotes minority MOMP, caspase-3/7 activation, and DNA damage.",2022-07-07
1547,TGFβ reprograms TNF stimulation of macrophages towards a non-canonical pathway driving inflammatory osteoclastogenesis,"It is well-established that receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) is the inducer of physiological osteoclast differentiation. However, the specific drivers and mechanisms driving inflammatory osteoclast differentiation under pathological conditions remain obscure. This is especially true given that inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) demonstrate little to no ability to directly drive osteoclast differentiation. Here, we found that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) priming enables TNF to effectively induce osteoclastogenesis, independently of the canonical RANKL pathway. Lack of TGFβ signaling in macrophages suppresses inflammatory, but not basal, osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vivo. Mechanistically, TGFβ priming reprograms the macrophage response to TNF by remodeling chromatin accessibility and histone modifications, and enables TNF to induce a previously unrecognized non-canonical osteoclastogenic program, which includes suppression of the TNF-induced IRF1-IFNβ-IFN-stimulated-gene axis, IRF8 degradation and B-Myb induction. These mechanisms are active in rheumatoid arthritis, in which TGFβ level is elevated and correlates with osteoclast activity. Our findings identify a TGFβ/TNF-driven inflammatory osteoclastogenic program, and may lead to development of selective treatments for inflammatory osteolysis.","Mechanisms for inflammatory osteolysis are unclear. Here, Xia et al. find that TGFβ shifts the inflammatory action of TNF on macrophages to a potent osteoclastogenic function and identify a novel TGFβ/TNF-mediated non-canonical osteoclastogenic program.",2022-07-07
1548,Origin of giant electric-field-induced strain in faulted alkali niobate films,"A large electromechanical response in ferroelectrics is highly desirable for developing high-performance sensors and actuators. Enhanced electromechanical coupling in ferroelectrics is usually obtained at morphotropic phase boundaries requiring stoichiometric control of complex compositions. Recently it was shown that giant piezoelectricity can be obtained in films with nanopillar structures. Here, we elucidate its origin in terms of atomic structure and demonstrate a different system with a greatly enhanced response. This is in non-stoichiometric potassium sodium niobate epitaxial thin films with a high density of self-assembled planar faults. A giant piezoelectric coefficient of ∼1900 picometer per volt is demonstrated at 1 kHz, which is almost double the highest ever reported effective piezoelectric response in any existing thin films. The large oxygen octahedral distortions and the coupling between the structural distortion and polarization orientation mediated by charge redistribution at the planar faults enable the giant electric-field-induced strain. Our findings demonstrate an important mechanism for realizing the unprecedentedly giant electromechanical coupling and can be extended to many other material functions by engineering lattice faults in non-stoichiometric compositions.","Maximizing the electromechanical response is crucial for developing piezoelectric devices. Here, the authors demonstrate a giant electric-field-induced strain and its origin in alkali niobate epitaxial thin films with self-assembled planar faults.",2022-07-07
1549,Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutations important for infection of mice and escape from human immune sera,"Due to differences in human and murine angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, initially available SARS-CoV-2 isolates could not infect mice. Here we show that serial passaging of USA-WA1/2020 strain in mouse lungs results in “mouse-adapted” SARS-CoV-2 (MA-SARS-CoV-2) with mutations in S, M, and N genes, and a twelve-nucleotide insertion in the S gene. MA-SARS-CoV-2 infection causes mild disease, with more pronounced morbidity depending on genetic background and in aged and obese mice. Two mutations in the S gene associated with mouse adaptation (N501Y, H655Y) are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs). N501Y in the receptor binding domain of viruses of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and B.1.1.529 lineages (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Omicron variants) is associated with high transmissibility and allows VoCs to infect wild type mice. We further show that S protein mutations of MA-SARS-CoV-2 do not affect neutralization efficiency by human convalescent and post vaccination sera.","Here, Rathnasinghe et al. characterize the pathogenesis of a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in infected obese and aged mice, and identify mutations that are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, associated with higher transmissibility.",2022-07-07
1550,Waveguide-integrated mid-infrared photodetection using graphene on a scalable chalcogenide glass platform,"The development of compact and fieldable mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopy devices represents a critical challenge for distributed sensing with applications from gas leak detection to environmental monitoring. Recent work has focused on mid-IR photonic integrated circuit (PIC) sensing platforms and waveguide-integrated mid-IR light sources and detectors based on semiconductors such as PbTe, black phosphorus and tellurene. However, material bandgaps and reliance on SiO2 substrates limit operation to wavelengths λ ≲ 4 μm. Here we overcome these challenges with a chalcogenide glass-on-CaF2 PIC architecture incorporating split-gate photothermoelectric graphene photodetectors. Our design extends operation to λ = 5.2 μm with a Johnson noise-limited noise-equivalent power of 1.1 nW/Hz1/2, no fall-off in photoresponse up to f = 1 MHz, and a predicted 3-dB bandwidth of f3dB > 1 GHz. This mid-IR PIC platform readily extends to longer wavelengths and opens the door to applications from distributed gas sensing and portable dual comb spectroscopy to weather-resilient free space optical communications.","Mid-infrared photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are important for sensing and optical communications, but their operational wavelengths are usually limited below 4 μm.

1551,Mutations in DNA polymerase δ subunit 1 co-segregate with CMD2-type resistance to Cassava Mosaic Geminiviruses,"Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) suppresses cassava yields across the tropics. The dominant CMD2 locus confers resistance to cassava mosaic geminiviruses. It has been reported that CMD2-type landraces lose resistance after regeneration through de novo morphogenesis. As full genome bisulfite sequencing failed to uncover an epigenetic mechanism for this loss of resistance, whole genome sequencing and genetic variant analysis was performed and the CMD2 locus was fine-mapped to a 190 kilobase interval. Collectively, these data indicate that CMD2-type resistance is caused by a nonsynonymous, single nucleotide polymorphism in DNA polymerase δ subunit 1 (MePOLD1) located within this region. Virus-induced gene silencing of MePOLD1 in a CMD-susceptible cassava variety produced a recovery phenotype typical of CMD2-type resistance. Analysis of other CMD2-type cassava varieties identified additional candidate resistance alleles within MePOLD1. Genetic variation of MePOLD1, therefore, could represent an important genetic resource for resistance breeding and/or genome editing, and elucidating mechanisms of resistance to geminiviruses.","Cassava mosaic disease is caused by geminiviruses and suppresses cassava yields throughout the tropics. Here, the authors show that mutations in MePOLD1, encoding DNA polymerase δ subunit 1, co-segregate with CMD2, the major source of genetic resistance for this disease.",2022-07-07
1552,Soliton walls paired by polar surface interactions in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal,"Surface interactions are responsible for many properties of condensed matter, ranging from crystal faceting to the kinetics of phase transitions. Usually, these interactions are polar along the normal to the interface and apolar within the interface. Here we demonstrate that polar in-plane surface interactions of a ferroelectric nematic NF produce polar monodomains in micron-thin planar cells and stripes of an alternating electric polarization, separated by \({180}^{{{{{{\rm{o}}}}}}}\) domain walls, in thicker slabs. The surface polarity binds together pairs of these walls, yielding a total polarization rotation by \({360}^{{{{{{\rm{o}}}}}}}\). The polar contribution to the total surface anchoring strength is on the order of 10%. The domain walls involve splay, bend, and twist of the polarization. The structure suggests that the splay elastic constant is larger than the bend modulus. The \({360}^{{{{{{\rm{o}}}}}}}\) pairs resemble domain walls in cosmology models with biased vacuums and ferromagnets in an external magnetic field.","Surface interactions are usually polar along the normal to the interface and apolar within the interface. Here, the authors find that polar in-plane surface interactions produce domain structures in the bulk of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal.",2022-07-07
1553,Mode-pairing quantum key distribution,"Quantum key distribution — the establishment of information-theoretically secure keys based on quantum physics — is mainly limited by its practical performance, which is characterised by the dependence of the key rate on the channel transmittance R(η). Recently, schemes based on single-photon interference have been proposed to improve the key rate to \(R=O(\sqrt{\eta })\) by overcoming the point-to-point secret key capacity bound with interferometers. Unfortunately, all of these schemes require challenging global phase locking to realise a stable long-arm single-photon interferometer with a precision of approximately 100 nm over fibres that are hundreds of kilometres long. Aiming to address this problem, we propose a mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution scheme in which the encoded key bits and bases are determined during data post-processing. Using conventional second-order interference, this scheme can achieve a key rate of \(R=O(\sqrt{\eta })\) without global phase locking when the local phase fluctuation is mild. We expect this high-performance scheme to be ready-to-implement with off-the-shelf optical devices.","Measurement-device-independent QKD schemes suffer from a trade-off between ease of implementation (avoiding the need for global phase locking) and high rates (quadratic improvement in rate). Here, the authors propose a protocol which offers both simple implementation and strong performances.",2022-07-07
1554,Determining the interlayer shearing in twisted bilayer MoS2 by nanoindentation,"The rise of twistronics has increased the attention of the community to the twist-angle-dependent properties of two-dimensional van der Waals integrated architectures. Clarification of the relationship between twist angles and interlayer mechanical interactions is important in benefiting the design of two-dimensional twisted structures. However, current mechanical methods have critical limitations in quantitatively probing the twist-angle dependence of two-dimensional interlayer interactions in monolayer limits. Here we report a nanoindentation-based technique and a shearing-boundary model to determine the interlayer mechanical interactions of twisted bilayer MoS2. Both in-plane elastic moduli and interlayer shear stress are found to be independent of the twist angle, which is attributed to the long-range interaction of intermolecular van der Waals forces that homogenously spread over the interfaces of MoS2. Our work provides a universal approach to determining the interlayer shear stress and deepens the understanding of twist-angle-dependent behaviours of two-dimensional layered materials.","The study of the mechanical properties of twisted van der Waals structures can provide important information about their interlayer coupling and electronic behaviour. Here, the authors report a nanoindentation-based technique to determine the interlayer shear stress in bilayer MoS2, showing its independence as a function of the twist angle.",2022-07-06
1555,Ligand-induced transmembrane conformational coupling in monomeric EGFR,"Single pass cell surface receptors regulate cellular processes by transmitting ligand-encoded signals across the plasma membrane via changes to their extracellular and intracellular conformations. This transmembrane signaling is generally initiated by ligand binding to the receptors in their monomeric form. While subsequent receptor-receptor interactions are established as key aspects of transmembrane signaling, the contribution of monomeric receptors has been challenging to isolate due to the complexity and ligand-dependence of these interactions. By combining membrane nanodiscs produced with cell-free expression, single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations, we report that ligand binding induces intracellular conformational changes within monomeric, full-length epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Our observations establish the existence of extracellular/intracellular conformational coupling within a single receptor molecule. We implicate a series of electrostatic interactions in the conformational coupling and find the coupling is inhibited by targeted therapeutics and mutations that also inhibit phosphorylation in cells. Collectively, these results introduce a facile mechanism to link the extracellular and intracellular regions through the single transmembrane helix of monomeric EGFR, and raise the possibility that intramolecular transmembrane conformational changes upon ligand binding are common to single-pass membrane proteins.","EGFR regulates cellular processes across the animal kingdom. Here, the authors show that transmembrane conformational coupling is the first step in EGFR signaling, providing evidence for the existence of transmembrane intramolecular conformational changes in a single pass membrane protein.",2022-07-06
1556,Decatungstate-catalyzed radical disulfuration through direct C-H functionalization for the preparation of unsymmetrical disulfides,"Unsymmetrical disulfides are widely found in the areas of food chemistry, pharmaceutical industry, chemical biology and polymer science. Due the importance of such disulfides in various fields, general methods for the nondirected intermolecular disulfuration of C-H bonds are highly desirable. In this work, the conversion of aliphatic C(sp3)-H bonds and aldehydic C(sp2)-H bonds into the corresponding C-SS bonds with tetrasulfides (RSSSSR) as radical disulfuration reagents is reported. The decatungstate anion ([W10O32]4−) as photocatalyst is used for C-radical generation via intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer in combination with cheap sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8) as oxidant. Herein a series of valuable acyl alkyl disulfides, important precursors for the generation of RSS-anions, and unsymmetrical dialkyl disulfides are synthesized using this direct approach. To demonstrate the potential of the method for late-stage functionalization, approved drugs and natural products were successfully C-H functionalized.","Despite the importance of unsymmetrical disulfides in various fields such as food chemistry, pharmaceutical industry, and polymer science, the nondirected intermolecular disulfuration of C-H bonds remains challenging.

1557,Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor Ga2O3 power diodes,"Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor Ga2O3 based electronic devices are expected to perform beyond wide bandgap counterparts GaN and SiC. However, the reported power figure-of-merit hardly can exceed, which is far below the projected Ga2O3 material limit. Major obstacles are high breakdown voltage requires low doping material and PN junction termination, contradicting with low specific on-resistance and simultaneous achieving of n- and p-type doping, respectively. In this work, we demonstrate that Ga2O3 heterojunction PN diodes can overcome above challenges. By implementing the holes injection in the Ga2O3, bipolar transport can induce conductivity modulation and low resistance in a low doping Ga2O3 material. Therefore, breakdown voltage of 8.32 kV, specific on-resistance of 5.24 mΩ⋅cm2, power figure-of-merit of 13.2 GW/cm2, and turn-on voltage of 1.8 V are achieved. The power figure-of-merit value surpasses the 1-D unipolar limit of GaN and SiC. Those Ga2O3 power diodes demonstrate their great potential for next-generation power electronics applications.","The simultaneous achievement of high breakdown voltage and low resistance is a contradictory point because it would require high and low doping simultaneously.

1558,Estuarine plastisphere as an overlooked source of N2O production,"“Plastisphere”, microbial communities colonizing plastic debris, has sparked global concern for marine ecosystems. Microbiome inhabiting this novel human-made niche has been increasingly characterized; however, whether the plastisphere holds crucial roles in biogeochemical cycling remains largely unknown. Here we evaluate the potential of plastisphere in biotic and abiotic denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) production in estuaries. Biofilm formation provides anoxic conditions favoring denitrifiers. Comparing with surrounding bulk water, plastisphere exhibits a higher denitrifying activity and N2O production, suggesting an overlooked N2O source. Regardless of plastisphere and bulk water, bacterial and fungal denitrifications are the main regulators for N2O production instead of chemodenitrification. However, the contributions of bacteria and fungi in the plastisphere are different from those in bulk water, indicating a distinct N2O production pattern in the plastisphere. These findings pinpoint plastisphere as a N2O source, and provide insights into roles of the new biotope in biogeochemical cycling in the Anthropocene.","The roles of marine plastisphere in global nitrogen cycling are largely unknown. Here, the authors indicate that the plastisphere could act as a potential source of N2O production, which is mainly regulated by the biotic denitrification",2022-07-06
1559,Deep learning from phylogenies to uncover the epidemiological dynamics of outbreaks,"Widely applicable, accurate and fast inference methods in phylodynamics are needed to fully profit from the richness of genetic data in uncovering the dynamics of epidemics. Standard methods, including maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches, generally rely on complex mathematical formulae and approximations, and do not scale with dataset size. We develop a likelihood-free, simulation-based approach, which combines deep learning with (1) a large set of summary statistics measured on phylogenies or (2) a complete and compact representation of trees, which avoids potential limitations of summary statistics and applies to any phylodynamics model. Our method enables both model selection and estimation of epidemiological parameters from very large phylogenies. We demonstrate its speed and accuracy on simulated data, where it performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. To illustrate its applicability, we assess the dynamics induced by superspreading individuals in an HIV dataset of men-having-sex-with-men in Zurich. Our tool PhyloDeep is available on github.com/evolbioinfo/phylodeep.","Widely applicable, accurate and fast inference methods in phylodynamics are needed to fully profit from the richness of genetic data in uncovering the dynamics of epidemics.

1560,Mitochondrial fission induces immunoescape in solid tumors through decreasing MHC-I surface expression,"Mitochondrial dynamics can regulate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-I antigen expression by cancer cells and their immunogenicity in mice and in patients with malignancies. A crucial role in the mitochondrial fragmentation connection with immunogenicity is played by the IRE1α-XBP-1s axis. XBP-1s is a transcription factor for aminopeptidase TPP2, which inhibits MHC-I complex cell surface expression likely by degrading tumor antigen peptides. Mitochondrial fission inhibition with Mdivi-1 upregulates MHC-I expression on cancer cells and enhances the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy in patient-derived tumor models. Therefore mitochondrial fission inhibition might provide an approach to enhance the efficacy of T cell-based immunotherapy.","Cancer cells downregulate surface expression of major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) for immune evasion. Here, the authors show that rapid mitochondrial fission activates the ER-stress response leading to reduced MHC-I complex formation and cell surface expression in solid cancer cells; moreover inhibition of mitochondrial fission increases the immune-mediated anticancer response in murine models.",2022-07-06
1561,Programmable synthetic cell networks regulated by tuneable reaction rates,"Coupled compartmentalised information processing and communication via molecular diffusion underpin network based population dynamics as observed in biological systems. Understanding how both compartmentalisation and communication can regulate information processes is key to rational design and control of compartmentalised reaction networks. Here, we integrate PEN DNA reactions into semi-permeable proteinosomes and characterise the effect of compartmentalisation on autocatalytic PEN DNA reactions. We observe unique behaviours in the compartmentalised systems which are not accessible under bulk conditions; for example, rates of reaction increase by an order of magnitude and reaction kinetics are more readily tuneable by enzyme concentrations in proteinosomes compared to buffer solution. We exploit these properties to regulate the reaction kinetics in two node compartmentalised reaction networks comprised of linear and autocatalytic reactions which we establish by bottom-up synthetic biology approaches.","Our understanding of how compartmentalisation and intercellular communication can tune enzyme reactions is still in its infancy. Here, the authors show that multi-enzyme reactions within semi-permeable compartments have distinct properties compared to reactions in buffer solution.",2022-07-06
1562,Comparison of chromatin accessibility landscapes during early development of prefrontal cortex between rhesus macaque and human,"Epigenetic information regulates gene expression and development. However, our understanding of the evolution of epigenetic regulation on brain development in primates is limited. Here, we compared chromatin accessibility landscapes and transcriptomes during fetal prefrontal cortex (PFC) development between rhesus macaques and humans. A total of 304,761 divergent DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are identified between rhesus macaques and humans, although many of these sites share conserved DNA sequences. Interestingly, most of the cis-elements linked to orthologous genes with dynamic expression are divergent DHSs. Orthologous genes expressed at earlier stages tend to have conserved cis-elements, whereas orthologous genes specifically expressed at later stages seldom have conserved cis-elements. These genes are enriched in synapse organization, learning and memory. Notably, DHSs in the PFC at early stages are linked to human educational attainment and cognitive performance. Collectively, the comparison of the chromatin epigenetic landscape between rhesus macaques and humans suggests a potential role for regulatory elements in the evolution of differences in cognitive ability between non-human primates and humans.","The evolution of epigenetic regulation of brain development in primates is not well understood. Here, the authors perform a comparative study of epigenetic dynamics of early prefrontal cortex development between human and rhesus macaque, finding divergent regulatory elements that may be related to cognitive capacity.",2022-07-06
1563,Periarteriolar spaces modulate cerebrospinal fluid transport into brain and demonstrate altered morphology in aging and Alzheimer’s disease,"Perivascular spaces (PVS) drain brain waste metabolites, but their specific flow paths are debated. Meningeal pia mater reportedly forms the outermost boundary that confines flow around blood vessels. Yet, we show that pia is perforated and permissive to PVS fluid flow. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pia is comprised of vascular and cerebral layers that coalesce in variable patterns along leptomeningeal arteries, often merging around penetrating arterioles. Heterogeneous pial architectures form variable sieve-like structures that differentially influence cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport along PVS. The degree of pial coverage correlates with macrophage density and phagocytosis of CSF tracer. In vivo imaging confirms transpial influx of CSF tracer, suggesting a role of pia in CSF filtration, but not flow restriction. Additionally, pial layers atrophy with age. Old mice also exhibit areas of pial denudation that are not observed in young animals, but pia is unexpectedly hypertrophied in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, pial thickness correlates with improved CSF flow and reduced β-amyloid deposits in PVS of old mice. We show that PVS morphology in mice is variable and that the structure and function of pia suggests a previously unrecognized role in regulating CSF transport and amyloid clearance in aging and disease.","The precise boundaries and flow compartments of perivascular spaces in the brain are incompletely understood. Here the authors show that pia is perforated and permissive to CSF flow, forming three types of perivascular spaces that remodel with age, with an abnormal type arising in Alzheimer’s disease and correlating with β-amyloid burden and differential macrophage uptake.",2022-07-06
1564,Molecular-level insight into photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O over Au nanoparticles by interband transitions,"Achieving CO2 reduction with H2O on metal photocatalysts and understanding the corresponding mechanisms at the molecular level are challenging. Herein, we report that quantum-sized Au nanoparticles can photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO with the help of H2O by electron-hole pairs mainly originating from interband transitions. Notably, the Au photocatalyst shows a CO production rate of 4.73 mmol g−1 h−1 (~100% selectivity), ~2.5 times the rate during CO2 reduction with H2 under the same experimental conditions, under low-intensity irradiation at 420 nm. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the increased activity is induced by surface Au–O species formed from H2O decomposition, which synchronously optimizes the rate-determining steps in the CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions, lowers the energy barriers for the *CO desorption and *OOH formation, and facilitates CO and O2 production. Our findings provide an in-depth mechanistic understanding for designing active metal photocatalysts for efficient CO2 reduction with H2O.","While plasmonic metals show some activity for photocatalysis, they often must be paired with semiconductors or sacrificial reagents. Here, authors find quantum-sized Au nanoparticles can achieve photocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion with H2O by charge carriers generated from interband transitions.",2022-07-06
1565,"Loss-of-function, gain-of-function and dominant-negative mutations have profoundly different effects on protein structure","Most known pathogenic mutations occur in protein-coding regions of DNA and change the way proteins are made. Taking protein structure into account has therefore provided great insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying human genetic disease. While there has been much focus on how mutations can disrupt protein structure and thus cause a loss of function (LOF), alternative mechanisms, specifically dominant-negative (DN) and gain-of-function (GOF) effects, are less understood. Here, we investigate the protein-level effects of pathogenic missense mutations associated with different molecular mechanisms. We observe striking differences between recessive vs dominant, and LOF vs non-LOF mutations, with dominant, non-LOF disease mutations having much milder effects on protein structure, and DN mutations being highly enriched at protein interfaces. We also find that nearly all computational variant effect predictors, even those based solely on sequence conservation, underperform on non-LOF mutations. However, we do show that non-LOF mutations could potentially be identified by their tendency to cluster in three-dimensional space. Overall, our work suggests that many pathogenic mutations that act via DN and GOF mechanisms are likely being missed by current variant prioritisation strategies, but that there is considerable scope to improve computational predictions through consideration of molecular disease mechanisms.","Most known pathogenic mutations occur in protein-coding regions of DNA and change the way proteins are made. Here the authors analyse the locations of thousands of human disease mutations and their predicted effects on protein structure and show that,while loss-of-function mutations tend to be highly disruptive, non-loss-of-function mutations are in general much milder at a protein structural level.",2022-07-06
1566,Nuclear speed and cycle length co-vary with local density during syncytial blastoderm formation in a cricket,"The blastoderm is a broadly conserved stage of early animal development, wherein cells form a layer at the embryo’s periphery. The cellular behaviors underlying blastoderm formation are varied and poorly understood. In most insects, the pre-blastoderm embryo is a syncytium: nuclei divide and move throughout the shared cytoplasm, ultimately reaching the cortex. In Drosophila melanogaster, some early nuclear movements result from pulsed cytoplasmic flows that are coupled to synchronous divisions. Here, we show that the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus has a different solution to the problem of creating a blastoderm. We quantified nuclear dynamics during blastoderm formation in G. bimaculatus embryos, finding that: (1) cytoplasmic flows are unimportant for nuclear movement, and (2) division cycles, nuclear speeds, and the directions of nuclear movement are not synchronized, instead being heterogeneous in space and time. Moreover, nuclear divisions and movements co-vary with local nuclear density. We show that several previously proposed models for nuclear movements in D. melanogaster cannot explain the dynamics of G. bimaculatus nuclei. We introduce a geometric model based on asymmetric pulling forces on nuclei, which recapitulates the patterns of nuclear speeds and orientations of both unperturbed G. bimaculatus embryos, and of embryos physically manipulated to have atypical nuclear densities.","Early in insect embryo development, many nuclei share one large cell, travel varied paths and self-organize into a single layer.

1567,Photo-thermo-induced room-temperature phosphorescence through solid-state molecular motion,"The development of smart-responsive materials, in particular those with non-invasive, rapid responsive phosphorescence, is highly desirable but has rarely been described. Herein, we designed and prepared a series of molecular rotors containing a triazine core and three bromobiphenyl units: o-Br-TRZ, m-Br-TRZ, and p-Br-TRZ. The bromine and triazine moieties serve as room temperature phosphorescence-active units, and the bromobiphenyl units serve as rotors to drive intramolecular rotation. When irradiated with strong ultraviolet photoirradiation, intramolecular rotations of o-Br-TRZ, m-Br-TRZ, and p-Br-TRZ increase, successively resulting in a photothermal effect via molecular motions. Impressively, the photothermal temperature attained by p-Br-TRZ is as high as 102 °C, and synchronously triggers its phosphorescence due to the ordered molecular arrangement after molecular motion. The thermal effect is expected to be important for triggering efficient phosphorescence, and the photon input for providing a precise and non-invasive stimulus. Such sequential photo-thermo-phosphorescence conversion is anticipated to unlock a new stimulus-responsive phosphorescence material without chemicals invasion.","The development of non-invasive, rapid responsive phosphorescence is highly desirable but has rarely been described. Herein, the authors designed and prepare a series of molecular rotors containing a room temperature phosphorescence active triazine core and three bromobiphenyl units acting as rotors and demonstrate light stimulus triggered phosphorescence.",2022-07-06
1568,Multiple social encounters can eliminate Crozier’s paradox and stabilise genetic kin recognition,"Crozier’s paradox suggests that genetic kin recognition will not be evolutionarily stable. The problem is that more common tags (markers) are more likely to be recognised and helped. This causes common tags to increase in frequency, and hence eliminates the genetic variability that is required for genetic kin recognition. It has therefore been assumed that genetic kin recognition can only be stable if there is some other factor maintaining tag diversity, such as the advantage of rare alleles in host-parasite interactions. We show that allowing for multiple social encounters before each social interaction can eliminate Crozier’s paradox, because it allows individuals with rare tags to find others with the same tag. We also show that rare tags are better indicators of relatedness, and hence better at helping individuals avoid interactions with non-cooperative cheats. Consequently, genetic kin recognition provides an advantage to rare tags that maintains tag diversity, and stabilises itself.","Crozier’s paradox suggests that genetic kin recognition will not be evolutionarily stable. Here, the authors show that allowing for multiple social encounters before each social interaction can eliminate Crozier’s paradox and stabilise genetic kin recognition.",2022-07-06
1569,Discovery of archaeal fusexins homologous to eukaryotic HAP2/GCS1 gamete fusion proteins,"Sexual reproduction consists of genome reduction by meiosis and subsequent gamete fusion. The presence of genes homologous to eukaryotic meiotic genes in archaea and bacteria suggests that DNA repair mechanisms evolved towards meiotic recombination. However, fusogenic proteins resembling those found in gamete fusion in eukaryotes have so far not been found in prokaryotes. Here, we identify archaeal proteins that are homologs of fusexins, a superfamily of fusogens that mediate eukaryotic gamete and somatic cell fusion, as well as virus entry. The crystal structure of a trimeric archaeal fusexin (Fusexin1 or Fsx1) reveals an archetypical fusexin architecture with unique features such as a six-helix bundle and an additional globular domain. Ectopically expressed Fusexin1 can fuse mammalian cells, and this process involves the additional globular domain and a conserved fusion loop. Furthermore, archaeal fusexin genes are found within integrated mobile elements, suggesting potential roles in cell-cell fusion and gene exchange in archaea, as well as different scenarios for the evolutionary history of fusexins.","Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes involves gamete fusion, mediated by fusogenic proteins.

To understand how a preference for social interactions is encoded, we used in vivo calcium imaging to compare medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity in female wild-type and Mecp2-heterozygous mice during three-chamber tests. We found that mPFC pyramidal neurons in Mecp2-deficient mice are hypo-responsive to both social and nonsocial stimuli. Hypothesizing that this limited dynamic range restricts the circuit’s ability to disambiguate coactivity patterns for different stimuli, we suppressed the mPFC in wild-type mice and found that this eliminated both pattern decorrelation and social preference. Conversely, stimulating the mPFC in MeCP2-deficient mice restored social preference, but only if it was sufficient to restore pattern decorrelation. A loss of social preference could thus indicate impaired pattern decorrelation rather than true social avoidance.","Impaired sociability is often interpreted as social avoidance. Here, the authors show that the problem is actually failure to distinguish social from nonsocial stimuli, caused by indistinguishable coactivity patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex.",2022-07-06
1571,The inequality labor loss risk from future urban warming and adaptation strategies,"Heat-induced labor loss is a major economic cost related to climate change. Here, we use hourly heat stress data modeled with a regional climate model to investigate the heat-induced labor loss in 231 Chinese cities. Results indicate that future urban heat stress is projected to cause an increase in labor losses exceeding 0.20% of the total account gross domestic product (GDP) per year by the 2050s relative to the 2010s. In this process, certain lower-paid sectors could be disproportionately impacted. The implementation of various urban adaptation strategies could offset 10% of the additional economic loss per year and help reduce the inequality-related impact on lower-paid sectors. So future urban warming can not only damage cities as a whole but can also contribute to income inequality. The implication of adaptation strategies should be considered in regard to not only cooling requirements but also environmental justice.","New study investigates heat-induced labor loss in 231 Chinese cities, finding that lower-paid sectors could be disproportionately affected in coming decades, although adaptation measures may mitigate inequality related impacts.",2022-07-06
1572,Dispersed emergence and protracted domestication of polyploid wheat uncovered by mosaic ancestral haploblock inference,"Major crops are all survivors of domestication bottlenecks. Studies have focused on the genetic loci related to the domestication syndrome, while the contribution of ancient haplotypes remains largely unknown. Here, an ancestral genomic haploblock dissection method is developed and applied to a resequencing dataset of 386 tetraploid/hexaploid wheat accessions, generating a pan-ancestry haploblock map. Together with cytoplastic evidences, we reveal that domesticated polyploid wheat emerged from the admixture of six founder wild emmer lineages, which contributed the foundation of ancestral mosaics. The key domestication-related loci, originated over a wide geographical range, were gradually pyramided through a protracted process. Diverse stable-inheritance ancestral haplotype groups of the chromosome central zone are identified, revealing the expanding routes of wheat and the trends of modern wheat breeding. Finally, an evolution model of polyploid wheat is proposed, highlighting the key role of wild-to-crop and interploidy introgression, that increased genomic diversity following bottlenecks introduced by domestication and polyploidization.","The contribution of ancient haplotypes to domestication is largely unknown. Here, the authors develop an ancestral genomic haploblock dissection method to generate a mosaic pan-ancestry genomic map and reveal that the domesticated polyploidy wheat emerged from the admixture of six founder wild emmer linages.",2022-07-06
1573,Population genomics of ancient and modern Trichuris trichiura,"The neglected tropical disease trichuriasis is caused by the whipworm Trichuris trichiura, a soil-transmitted helminth that has infected humans for millennia. Today, T. trichiura infects as many as 500 million people, predominantly in communities with poor sanitary infrastructure enabling sustained faecal-oral transmission. Using whole-genome sequencing of geographically distributed worms collected from human and other primate hosts, together with ancient samples preserved in archaeologically-defined latrines and deposits dated up to one thousand years old, we present the first population genomics study of T. trichiura. We describe the continent-scale genetic structure between whipworms infecting humans and baboons relative to those infecting other primates. Admixture and population demographic analyses support a stepwise distribution of genetic variation that is highest in Uganda, consistent with an African origin and subsequent translocation with human migration. Finally, genome-wide analyses between human samples and between human and non-human primate samples reveal local regions of genetic differentiation between geographically distinct populations. These data provide insight into zoonotic reservoirs of human-infective T. trichiura and will support future efforts toward the implementation of genomic epidemiology of this globally important helminth.","The whipworm Trichuris trichiura is a soil-transmitted helminth that causes the neglected tropical disease trichuriasis in humans.

1574,Transcriptional programming in a Bacteroides consortium,"Bacteroides species are prominent members of the human gut microbiota. The prevalence and stability of Bacteroides in humans make them ideal candidates to engineer as programmable living therapeutics. Here we report a biotic decision-making technology in a community of Bacteroides (consortium transcriptional programming) with genetic circuit compression. Circuit compression requires systematic pairing of engineered transcription factors with cognate regulatable promoters. In turn, we demonstrate the compression workflow by designing, building, and testing all fundamental two-input logic gates dependent on the inputs isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and D-ribose. We then deploy complete sets of logical operations in five human donor Bacteroides, with which we demonstrate sequential gain-of-function control in co-culture. Finally, we couple transcriptional programs with CRISPR interference to achieve loss-of-function regulation of endogenous genes—demonstrating complex control over community composition in co-culture. This work provides a powerful toolkit to program gene expression in Bacteroides for the development of bespoke therapeutic bacteria.","Bacteroides species are prominent members of the human gut microbiota. Here the authors develop a platform technology (consortium transcriptional programming) in five human donor Bacteroides chassis cells—enabling complex decision-making within said community, which can be used for the development of living therapeutics.",2022-07-06
1575,Clinical relevance of molecular characteristics in Burkitt lymphoma differs according to age,"While survival has improved for Burkitt lymphoma patients, potential differences in outcome between pediatric and adult patients remain unclear. In both age groups, survival remains poor at relapse. Therefore, we conducted a comparative study in a large pediatric cohort, including 191 cases and 97 samples from adults. While TP53 and CCND3 mutation frequencies are not age related, samples from pediatric patients showed a higher frequency of mutations in ID3, DDX3X, ARID1A and SMARCA4, while several genes such as BCL2 and YY1AP1 are almost exclusively mutated in adult patients. An unbiased analysis reveals a transition of the mutational profile between 25 and 40 years of age. Survival analysis in the pediatric cohort confirms that TP53 mutations are significantly associated with higher incidence of relapse (25 ± 4% versus 6 ± 2%, p-value 0.0002). This identifies a promising molecular marker for relapse incidence in pediatric BL which will be used in future clinical trials.","Survival outcomes in Burkitt lymphoma differ between adult and paediatric patients. Here, the authors show differences in mutational frequencies between age groups, and a transition between mutational profiles which occurs between 25 and 40 years.",2022-07-06
1576,Spatial regulation of AMPK signaling revealed by a sensitive kinase activity reporter,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of cellular energetics which coordinates metabolism by phosphorylating a plethora of substrates throughout the cell. But how AMPK activity is regulated at different subcellular locations for precise spatiotemporal control over metabolism is unclear. Here we present a sensitive, single-fluorophore AMPK activity reporter (ExRai AMPKAR), which reveals distinct kinetic profiles of AMPK activity at the mitochondria, lysosome, and cytoplasm. Genetic deletion of the canonical upstream kinase liver kinase B1 (LKB1) results in slower AMPK activity at lysosomes but does not affect the response amplitude at lysosomes or mitochondria, in sharp contrast to the necessity of LKB1 for maximal cytoplasmic AMPK activity. We further identify a mechanism for AMPK activity in the nucleus, which results from cytoplasmic to nuclear shuttling of AMPK. Thus, ExRai AMPKAR enables illumination of the complex subcellular regulation of AMPK signaling.","AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of cellular metabolism, but how AMPK activity is spatiotemporally regulated remains unclear. Here, Schmitt et al develop a sensitive biosensor for AMPK, which they use to uncover mechanisms for AMPK activity in the lysosome and nucleus.",2022-07-05
1577,Metaproteomics reveals enzymatic strategies deployed by anaerobic microbiomes to maintain lignocellulose deconstruction at high solids,"Economically viable production of cellulosic biofuels requires operation at high solids loadings—on the order of 15 wt%. To this end we characterize Nature’s ability to deconstruct and utilize mid-season switchgrass at increasing solid loadings using an anaerobic methanogenic microbiome. This community exhibits undiminished fractional carbohydrate solubilization at loadings ranging from 30 g/L to 150 g/L. Metaproteomic interrogation reveals marked increases in the abundance of specific carbohydrate-active enzyme classes. Significant enrichment of auxiliary activity family 6 enzymes at higher solids suggests a role for Fenton chemistry. Stress-response proteins accompanying these reactions are similarly upregulated at higher solids, as are β-glucosidases, xylosidases, carbohydrate-debranching, and pectin-acting enzymes—all of which indicate that removal of deconstruction inhibitors is important for observed undiminished solubilization. Our work provides insights into the mechanisms by which natural microbiomes effectively deconstruct and utilize lignocellulose at high solids loadings, informing the future development of defined cultures for efficient bioconversion.","Efficient solubilization of plant cell wall carbohydrates is required for microbial production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Here, the authors employ metaproteomics to interrogate enzymatic strategies of a methanogenic microbiome deconstructing switchgrass at increasing solids loading.",2022-07-05
1578,Wavelength-multiplexed hook nanoantennas for machine learning enabled mid-infrared spectroscopy,"Infrared (IR) plasmonic nanoantennas (PNAs) are powerful tools to identify molecules by the IR fingerprint absorption from plasmon-molecules interaction. However, the sensitivity and bandwidth of PNAs are limited by the small overlap between molecules and sensing hotspots and the sharp plasmonic resonance peaks. In addition to intuitive methods like enhancement of electric field of PNAs and enrichment of molecules on PNAs surfaces, we propose a loss engineering method to optimize damping rate by reducing radiative loss using hook nanoantennas (HNAs). Furthermore, with the spectral multiplexing of the HNAs from gradient dimension, the wavelength-multiplexed HNAs (WMHNAs) serve as ultrasensitive vibrational probes in a continuous ultra-broadband region (wavelengths from 6 μm to 9 μm). Leveraging the multi-dimensional features captured by WMHNA, we develop a machine learning method to extract complementary physical and chemical information from molecules. The proof-of-concept demonstration of molecular recognition from mixed alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol) shows 100% identification accuracy from the microfluidic integrated WMHNAs. Our work brings another degree of freedom to optimize PNAs towards small-volume, real-time, label-free molecular recognition from various species in low concentrations for chemical and biological diagnostics.","Infrared spectroscopy with plasmonic nanoantennas is limited by small overlap between molecules and hot spots, and sharp resonance peaks.

1579,Inferring the epidemiological benefit of indoor vector control interventions against malaria from mosquito data,"The cause of malaria transmission has been known for over a century but it is still unclear whether entomological measures are sufficiently reliable to inform policy decisions in human health. Decision-making on the effectiveness of new insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and the indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) have been based on epidemiological data, typically collected in cluster-randomised control trials. The number of these trials that can be conducted is limited. Here we use a systematic review to highlight that efficacy estimates of the same intervention may vary substantially between trials. Analyses indicate that mosquito data collected in experimental hut trials can be used to parameterize mechanistic models for Plasmodium falciparum malaria and reliably predict the epidemiological efficacy of quick-acting, neuro-acting ITNs and IRS. Results suggest that for certain types of ITNs and IRS using this framework instead of clinical endpoints could support policy and expedite the widespread use of novel technologies.","Estimating the effectiveness of malaria vector control interventions has typically relied on resource-intensive cluster randomised trials. Here, the authors estimate changes in malaria prevalence using entomological data from experimental hut trials, which may provide an alternative route to approval of interventions in some situations.",2022-07-05
1580,Vibrio cholerae O139 genomes provide a clue to why it may have failed to usher in the eighth cholera pandemic,"Cholera is a life-threatening infectious disease that remains an important public health issue in several low and middle-income countries. In 1992, a newly identified O139 Vibrio cholerae temporarily displaced the O1 serogroup. No study has been able to answer why the potential eighth cholera pandemic (8CP) causing V. cholerae O139 emerged so successfully and then died out. We conducted a genomic study, including 330 O139 isolates, covering emergence of the serogroup in 1992 through to 2015. We noted two key genomic evolutionary changes that may have been responsible for the disappearance of genetically distinct but temporally overlapping waves (A-C) of O139. Firstly, as the waves progressed, a switch from a homogenous toxin genotype in wave-A to heterogeneous genotypes. Secondly, a gradual loss of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) with the progression of waves. We hypothesize that these two changes contributed to the eventual epidemiological decline of O139.","The O139 Vibrio cholerae serogroup emerged in the 1990s and spread rapidly but did not become globally dominant. Here, the authors describe the genomic epidemiology of this strain and identify changes in virulence and antimicrobial resistance characteristics that they hypothesise may have contributed to its decline.",2022-07-05
1581,Mechanistic basis for maintenance of CHG DNA methylation in plants,"DNA methylation is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mechanism essential for transposon silencing and heterochromatin assembly. In plants, DNA methylation widely occurs in the CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, C, or T) contexts, with the maintenance of CHG methylation mediated by CMT3 chromomethylase. However, how CMT3 interacts with the chromatin environment for faithful maintenance of CHG methylation is unclear. Here we report structure-function characterization of the H3K9me2-directed maintenance of CHG methylation by CMT3 and its Zea mays ortholog ZMET2. Base-specific interactions and DNA deformation coordinately underpin the substrate specificity of CMT3 and ZMET2, while a bivalent readout of H3K9me2 and H3K18 allosterically stimulates substrate binding. Disruption of the interaction with DNA or H3K9me2/H3K18 led to loss of CMT3/ZMET2 activity in vitro and impairment of genome-wide CHG methylation in vivo. Together, our study uncovers how the intricate interplay of CMT3, repressive histone marks, and DNA sequence mediates heterochromatic CHG methylation.","In plants, DNA methylation in the CHG context is maintained by the CMT3 chromomethylases. Here the authors provide a structure-function characterization of a maize CMT3 ortholog to show how recognition of histone modifications stimulate DNA methylation.",2022-07-05
1582,A versatile active learning workflow for optimization of genetic and metabolic networks,"Optimization of biological networks is often limited by wet lab labor and cost, and the lack of convenient computational tools. Here, we describe METIS, a versatile active machine learning workflow with a simple online interface for the data-driven optimization of biological targets with minimal experiments. We demonstrate our workflow for various applications, including cell-free transcription and translation, genetic circuits, and a 27-variable synthetic CO2-fixation cycle (CETCH cycle), improving these systems between one and two orders of magnitude. For the CETCH cycle, we explore 1025 conditions with only 1,000 experiments to yield the most efficient CO2-fixation cascade described to date. Beyond optimization, our workflow also quantifies the relative importance of individual factors to the performance of a system identifying unknown interactions and bottlenecks. Overall, our workflow opens the way for convenient optimization and prototyping of genetic and metabolic networks with customizable adjustments according to user experience, experimental setup, and laboratory facilities.","Optimization of biological networks is often limited by wet lab labor and cost, and the lack of convenient computational tools.

1583,Engineering consortia by polymeric microbial swarmbots,"Synthetic microbial consortia represent a new frontier for synthetic biology given that they can solve more complex problems than monocultures. However, most attempts to co-cultivate these artificial communities fail because of the winner-takes-all in nutrients competition. In soil, multiple species can coexist with a spatial organization. Inspired by nature, here we show that an engineered spatial segregation method can assemble stable consortia with both flexibility and precision. We create microbial swarmbot consortia (MSBC) by encapsulating subpopulations with polymeric microcapsules. The crosslinked structure of microcapsules fences microbes, but allows the transport of small molecules and proteins. MSBC method enables the assembly of various synthetic communities and the precise control over the subpopulations. These capabilities can readily modulate the division of labor and communication. Our work integrates the synthetic biology and material science to offer insights into consortia assembly and serve as foundation to diverse applications from biomanufacturing to engineered photosynthesis.","Most attempts to co-cultivate the artificial microbial communities fail mostly due to the mismatched rates of consumption and production of nutrients among subpopulations. Here, the authors develop a microbial swarmbot mediated spatial segregation method to assemble stably coexisting consortia with both flexibility and precision.",2022-07-05
1584,An expanded reference map of the human gut microbiome reveals hundreds of previously unknown species,"The gut is the richest ecosystem of microbes in the human body and has great influence on our health. Despite many efforts, the set of microbes inhabiting this environment is not fully known, limiting our ability to identify microbial content and to research it. In this work, we combine new microbial metagenomic assembled genomes from 51,052 samples, with previously published genomes to produce a curated set of 241,118 genomes. Based on this set, we procure a new and improved human gut microbiome reference set of 3594 high quality species genomes, which successfully matches 83.65% validation samples’ reads. This improved reference set contains 310 novel species, including one that exists in 19% of validation samples. Overall, this study provides a gut microbial genome reference set that can serve as a valuable resource for further research.","Here, Leviatan et al. produce 241,118 genome assemblies to produce a new human gut microbiome reference set of 3,594 species genomes, of which 310 represent previously undescribed species, making the catalog a valuable resource for further research.",2022-07-05
1585,Multi-year El Niño events tied to the North Pacific Oscillation,"Multi-year El Niño events induce severe and persistent floods and droughts worldwide, with significant socioeconomic impacts, but the causes of their long-lasting behaviors are still not fully understood. Here we present a two-way feedback mechanism between the tropics and extratropics to argue that extratropical atmospheric variability associated with the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) is a key source of multi-year El Niño events. The NPO during boreal winter can trigger a Central Pacific El Niño during the subsequent winter, which excites atmospheric teleconnections to the extratropics that re-energize the NPO variability, then re-triggers another El Niño event in the following winter, finally resulting in persistent El Niño-like states. Model experiments, with the NPO forcing assimilated to constrain atmospheric circulation, reproduce the observed connection between NPO forcing and the occurrence of multi-year El Niño events. Future projections of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 5 and 6 models demonstrate that with enhanced NPO variability under future anthropogenic forcing, more frequent multi-year El Niño events should be expected. We conclude that properly accounting for the effects of the NPO on the evolution of El Niño events may improve multi-year El Niño prediction and projection.","The causes of long-lasting behaviors of multi-year El Niño are still not fully understood. Here, the authors find that persistent two-way teleconnections between the North Pacific Oscillation and the tropical Pacific constitute a key source of multi-year El Niño.",2022-07-05
1586,Dynamic enlargement and mobilization of lipid droplets in pluripotent cells coordinate morphogenesis during mouse peri-implantation development,"Mammalian pre-implantation embryos accumulate substantial lipids, which are stored in lipid droplets (LDs). Despite the fundamental roles of lipids in many cellular functions, the significance of building-up LDs for the developing embryo remains unclear. Here we report that the accumulation and mobilization of LDs upon implantation are causal in the morphogenesis of the pluripotent epiblast and generation of the pro-amniotic cavity in mouse embryos, a critical step for all subsequent development. We show that the CIDEA protein, found abundantly in adipocytes, enhances lipid storage in blastocysts and pluripotent stem cells by promoting LD enlargement through fusion. The LD-stored lipids are mobilized into lysosomes at the onset of lumenogenesis, but without CIDEA are prematurely degraded by cytosolic lipases. Loss of lipid storage or inactivation of lipophagy leads to the aberrant formation of multiple cavities within disorganised epithelial structures. Thus, our study reveals an unexpected role for LDs in orchestrating tissue remodelling and uncovers underappreciated facets of lipid metabolism in peri-implantation development.","Prior to its implantation into the uterus, the mammalian embryo stores substantial lipids. Here the authors unveil how lipid storage and morphogenesis of pluripotent stem cells are fundamentally connected during peri-implantation development.",2022-07-05
1587,Atypical sideways recognition of CD1a by autoreactive γδ T cell receptors,"CD1a is a monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule on dendritic cells that presents lipids to αβ T cells. Whether CD1a represents a ligand for other immune receptors remains unknown. Here we use CD1a tetramers to show that CD1a is a ligand for Vδ1+ γδ T cells. Functional studies suggest that two γδ T cell receptors (TCRs) bound CD1a in a lipid-independent manner. The crystal structures of three Vγ4Vδ1 TCR-CD1a-lipid complexes reveal that the γδ TCR binds at the extreme far side and parallel to the long axis of the β-sheet floor of CD1a’s antigen-binding cleft. Here, the γδ TCR co-recognises the CD1a heavy chain and β2 microglobulin in a manner that is distinct from all other previously observed γδ TCR docking modalities. The ‘sideways’ and lipid antigen independent mode of autoreactive CD1a recognition induces TCR clustering on the cell surface and proximal T cell signalling as measured by CD3ζ phosphorylation. In contrast with the ‘end to end’ binding of αβ TCRs that typically contact carried antigens, autoreactive γδ TCRs support geometrically diverse approaches to CD1a, as well as antigen independent recognition.",T cell receptors are generally thought to contact antigens presented in an end to end configuration. Here the authors show a geometrically alternate sideways mode of recognition of the antigen-presenting molecule CD1a by a γδ T cell receptor.,2022-07-05
1588,Potentiating hypoxic microenvironment for antibiotic activation by photodynamic therapy to combat bacterial biofilm infections,"Traditional antibiotic treatment has limited efficacy for the drug-tolerant bacteria present in biofilms because of their unique metabolic conditions in the biofilm infection microenvironment. Modulating the biofilm infection microenvironment may influence the metabolic state of the bacteria and provide alternative therapeutic routes. In this study, photodynamic therapy is used not only to eradicate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in the normoxic condition, but also to potentiate the hypoxic microenvironment, which induces the anaerobic metabolism of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and activates the antibacterial activity of metronidazole. Moreover, the photodynamic therapy-activated chemotherapy can polarize the macrophages to a M2-like phenotype and promote the repair of the biofilm infected wounds in mice. This biofilm infection microenvironment modulation strategy, whereby the hypoxic microenvironment is potentiated to synergize photodynamic therapy with chemotherapy, provides an alternative pathway for efficient treatment of biofilm-associated infections.","Bacteria in biofilms present unique metabolic conditions that limit the traditional antibiotic treatment.

1589,Bixbyite-type Ln2O3 as promoters of metallic Ni for alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"The active-site density, intrinsic activity, and durability of Ni-based catalysts are critical to their application in industrial alkaline water electrolysis. This work develops a kind of promoters, the bixbyite-type lanthanide metal sesquioxides (Ln2O3), which can be implanted into metallic Ni by selective high-temperature reduction to achieve highly efficient Ni/Ln2O3 hybrid electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction. The screened Ni/Yb2O3 catalyst shows the low overpotential (20.0 mV at 10 mA cm−2), low Tafel slope (44.6 mV dec−1), and excellent long-term durability (360 h at 500 mA cm−2), significantly outperforming the metallic Ni and benchmark Pt/C catalysts. The remarkable hydrogen evolution activity and stability of Ni/Yb2O3 are attributed to that the Yb2O3 promoter with high oxophilicity and thermodynamic stability can greatly enlarge the active-site density, reduce the energy barrier of water dissociation, optimize the free energy of hydrogen adsorption, and avoid the oxidation corrosion of Ni.","While renewable H2 evolution will require inexpensive, abundant catalysts, non-noble metals typically show relatively low activities.

1590,Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of the developing mouse inner ear identifies molecular logic of auditory neuron diversification,"Different types of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are essential for auditory perception by transmitting complex auditory information from hair cells (HCs) to the brain. Here, we use deep, single cell transcriptomics to study the molecular mechanisms that govern their identity and organization in mice. We identify a core set of temporally patterned genes and gene regulatory networks that may contribute to the diversification of SGNs through sequential binary decisions and demonstrate a role for NEUROD1 in driving specification of a Ic-SGN phenotype. We also find that each trajectory of the decision tree is defined by initial co-expression of alternative subtype molecular controls followed by gradual shifts toward cell fate resolution. Finally, analysis of both developing SGN and HC types reveals cell-cell signaling potentially playing a role in the differentiation of SGNs. Our results indicate that SGN identities are drafted prior to birth and reveal molecular principles that shape their differentiation and will facilitate studies of their development, physiology, and dysfunction.","This study chronicles dynamic gene expression in differentiating spiral ganglion neurons from murine embryonic day 14.5 to postnatal stage, establishes their lineage trajectories, and identifies molecular determinants of cell fate decision.",2022-07-05
1591,Atomic-scale insights on hydrogen trapping and exclusion at incoherent interfaces of nanoprecipitates in martensitic steels,"Hydrogen is well known to embrittle high-strength steels and impair their corrosion resistance. One of the most attractive methods to mitigate hydrogen embrittlement employs nanoprecipitates, which are widely used for strengthening, to trap and diffuse hydrogen from enriching at vulnerable locations within the materials. However, the atomic origin of hydrogen-trapping remains elusive, especially in incoherent nanoprecipitates. Here, by combining in-situ scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, we unveil distinct scenarios of hydrogen-precipitate interaction in a high-strength low-alloyed martensitic steel. It is found that not all incoherent interfaces are trapping hydrogen; some may even exclude hydrogen. Atomic-scale structural and chemical features of the very interfaces suggest that carbon/sulfur vacancies on the precipitate surface and tensile strain fields in the nearby matrix likely determine the hydrogen-trapping characteristics of the interface. These findings provide fundamental insights that may lead to a better coupling of precipitation-strengthening strategy with hydrogen-insensitive designs.","By trapping hydrogen, nanoprecipitates can mitigate the hydrogen embrittlement of high strength steels. Here, the authors report direct evidences on the structural and chemical features underlying distinct hydrogen-trapping behaviors at the incoherent interfaces of precipitates and steel matrix.",2022-07-05
1592,Monomethyl auristatin antibody and peptide drug conjugates for trimodal cancer chemo-radio-immunotherapy,"Locally advanced cancers remain therapeutically challenging to eradicate. The most successful treatments continue to combine decades old non-targeted chemotherapies with radiotherapy that unfortunately increase normal tissue damage in the irradiated field and have systemic toxicities precluding further treatment intensification. Therefore, alternative molecularly guided systemic therapies are needed to improve patient outcomes when applied with radiotherapy. In this work, we report a trimodal precision cytotoxic chemo-radio-immunotherapy paradigm using spatially targeted auristatin warheads. Tumor-directed antibodies and peptides conjugated to radiosensitizing monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) specifically produce CD8 T cell dependent durable tumor control of irradiated tumors and immunologic memory. In combination with ionizing radiation, MMAE sculpts the tumor immune infiltrate to potentiate immune checkpoint inhibition. Here, we report therapeutic synergies of targeted cytotoxic auristatin radiosensitization to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses providing a rationale for clinical translational of auristatin antibody drug conjugates with radio-immunotherapy combinations to improve tumor control.","Monomethyl auristatin (MMAE), also known for its radiosensitizer properties, is a common antibody drug conjugate used for cancer therapy.

1593,Structures of LIG1 that engage with mutagenic mismatches inserted by polβ in base excision repair,"DNA ligase I (LIG1) catalyzes the ligation of the nick repair intermediate after gap filling by DNA polymerase (pol) β during downstream steps of the base excision repair (BER) pathway. However, how LIG1 discriminates against the mutagenic 3′-mismatches incorporated by polβ at atomic resolution remains undefined. Here, we determine the X-ray structures of LIG1/nick DNA complexes with G:T and A:C mismatches and uncover the ligase strategies that favor or deter the ligation of base substitution errors. Our structures reveal that the LIG1 active site can accommodate a G:T mismatch in the wobble conformation, where an adenylate (AMP) is transferred to the 5′-phosphate of a nick (DNA-AMP), while it stays in the LIG1-AMP intermediate during the initial step of the ligation reaction in the presence of an A:C mismatch at the 3′-strand. Moreover, we show mutagenic ligation and aberrant nick sealing of dG:T and dA:C mismatches, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that AP-endonuclease 1 (APE1), as a compensatory proofreading enzyme, removes the mismatched bases and interacts with LIG1 at the final BER steps. Our overall findings provide the features of accurate versus mutagenic outcomes coordinated by a multiprotein complex including polβ, LIG1, and APE1 to maintain efficient repair.",Ligase I seals two ends of DNA during DNA repair and replication.

Here, we demonstrate a femtosecond solid-state laser at 1.0 µm with Bi2O2Se nanoplates as a saturable absorber (SA). Upon further defect regulation in 2D Bi2O2Se, the average power of the mode-locked laser is improved from 421 mW to 665 mW, while the pulse width is decreased from 587 fs to 266 fs. Moderate Ar+ plasma treatments are employed to precisely regulate the O and Se defect states in Bi2O2Se nanoplates. Nondegenerate pump-probe measurements show that defect engineering effectively accelerates the trapping rate and defect-assisted Auger recombination rate of photocarriers. The saturation intensity is improved from 3.6 ± 0.2 to 12.8 ± 0.6 MW cm−2 after the optimized defect regulation. The enhanced saturable absorption and ultrafast carrier lifetime endow the high-performance mode-locked laser with both large output power and short pulse duration.","Bi2O2Se holds potential for the realization of 2D optical modulators due to its broadband nonlinear response, air stability and carrier mobility.

1595,Detection of relativistic fermions in Weyl semimetal TaAs by magnetostriction measurements,"Thus far, a detection of the Dirac or Weyl fermions in topological semimetals remains often elusive, since in these materials conventional charge carriers exist as well. Here, measuring a field-induced length change of the prototype Weyl semimetal TaAs at low temperatures, we find that its c-axis magnetostriction amounts to relatively large values whereas the a-axis magnetostriction exhibits strong variations with changing the orientation of the applied magnetic field. It is discovered that at magnetic fields above the ultra-quantum limit, the magnetostriction of TaAs contains a linear-in-field term, which, as we show, is a hallmark of the Weyl fermions in a material. Developing a theory for the magnetostriction of noncentrosymmetric topological semimetals and applying it to TaAs, we additionally find several parameters characterizing the interaction between the relativistic fermions and elastic degrees of freedom in this semimetal. Our study shows how dilatometry can be used to unveil Weyl fermions in candidate topological semimetals.","Detecting Weyl or Dirac charge carriers in topological semimetals is challenging due to the presence of their conventional counterparts. In this manuscript, the authors show that magnetostriction offers clearly distinguishable conventional and Weyl or Dirac charge carrier contributions when the latter are in their quantum limit.",2022-07-05
1596,Selective activation and expansion of regulatory T cells using lipid encapsulated mRNA encoding a long-acting IL-2 mutein,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is critical for regulatory T cell (Treg) function and homeostasis. At low doses, IL-2 can suppress immune pathologies by expanding Tregs that constitutively express the high affinity IL-2Rα subunit. However, even low dose IL-2, signaling through the IL2-Rβ/γ complex, may lead to the activation of proinflammatory, non-Treg T cells, so improving specificity toward Tregs may be desirable. Here we use messenger RNAs (mRNA) to encode a half-life-extended human IL-2 mutein (HSA-IL2m) with mutations promoting reliance on IL-2Rα. Our data show that IL-2 mutein subcutaneous delivery as lipid-encapsulated mRNA nanoparticles selectively activates and expands Tregs in mice and non-human primates, and also reduces disease severity in mouse models of acute graft versus host disease and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Single cell RNA-sequencing of mouse splenic CD4+ T cells identifies multiple Treg states with distinct response dynamics following IL-2 mutein treatment. Our results thus demonstrate the potential of mRNA-encoded HSA-IL2m immunotherapy to treat autoimmune diseases.","IL-2 has been used to expand regulatory T (Treg) cells for treating inflammatory disorders. Here the authors test an engineered IL-2 mutein, delivered subcutaneously as mRNA, to show its increased specificity for activating and expanding Treg cells in both rodents and non-human primates, and to demonstrate its ability to suppress autoimmunity in mouse models.",2022-07-05
1597,Potential impacts of climate change on agriculture and fisheries production in 72 tropical coastal communities,"Climate change is expected to profoundly affect key food production sectors, including fisheries and agriculture. However, the potential impacts of climate change on these sectors are rarely considered jointly, especially below national scales, which can mask substantial variability in how communities will be affected. Here, we combine socioeconomic surveys of 3,008 households and intersectoral multi-model simulation outputs to conduct a sub-national analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on fisheries and agriculture in 72 coastal communities across five Indo-Pacific countries (Indonesia, Madagascar, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, and Tanzania). Our study reveals three key findings: First, overall potential losses to fisheries are higher than potential losses to agriculture. Second, while most locations (> 2/3) will experience potential losses to both fisheries and agriculture simultaneously, climate change mitigation could reduce the proportion of places facing that double burden. Third, potential impacts are more likely in communities with lower socioeconomic status.","Responses of agriculture and fisheries to climate change are interlinked, yet rarely studied together. Here, the authors analyse more than 3000 households from 5 tropical countries and forecast mid-century climate change impacts, finding that communities with higher fishery dependence and lower socioeconomic status communities face greater losses.",2022-07-05
1598,Healthy cloned offspring derived from freeze-dried somatic cells,"Maintaining biodiversity is an essential task, but storing germ cells as genetic resources using liquid nitrogen is difficult, expensive, and easily disrupted during disasters. Our aim is to generate cloned mice from freeze-dried somatic cell nuclei, preserved at −30 °C for up to 9 months after freeze drying treatment. All somatic cells died after freeze drying, and nucleic DNA damage significantly increased. However, after nuclear transfer, we produced cloned blastocysts from freeze-dried somatic cells, and established nuclear transfer embryonic stem cell lines. Using these cells as nuclear donors for re-cloning, we obtained healthy cloned female and male mice with a success rate of 0.2–5.4%. Here, we show that freeze-dried somatic cells can produce healthy, fertile clones, suggesting that this technique may be important for the establishment of alternative, cheaper, and safer liquid nitrogen-free bio-banking solutions.","The development of safe preservation methods for genetic resources is important. Here, the authors successfully produce cloned mice from freeze-dried somatic cells, demonstrating the possibility of safe and low-cost preservation of genetic resources.",2022-07-05
1599,Co-occurrence networks reveal more complexity than community composition in resistance and resilience of microbial communities,"Plant response to drought stress involves fungi and bacteria that live on and in plants and in the rhizosphere, yet the stability of these myco- and micro-biomes remains poorly understood. We investigate the resistance and resilience of fungi and bacteria to drought in an agricultural system using both community composition and microbial associations. Here we show that tests of the fundamental hypotheses that fungi, as compared to bacteria, are (i) more resistant to drought stress but (ii) less resilient when rewetting relieves the stress, found robust support at the level of community composition. Results were more complex using all-correlations and co-occurrence networks. In general, drought disrupts microbial networks based on significant positive correlations among bacteria, among fungi, and between bacteria and fungi. Surprisingly, co-occurrence networks among functional guilds of rhizosphere fungi and leaf bacteria were strengthened by drought, and the same was seen for networks involving arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the rhizosphere. We also found support for the stress gradient hypothesis because drought increased the relative frequency of positive correlations.","Fungi are expected to be more resistant and less resilient than bacteria to environmental disturbances. Here, the authors report complex responses by microbial co-occurrence networks to drought in an agricultural system, challenging simple predictions of fungal and bacterial drought responses.",2022-07-05
1600,Preparation of photonic molecular trains via soft-crystal polymerization of lanthanide complexes,"Soft-crystals are defined as flexible molecular solids with highly ordered structures and have attracted attention in molecular sensing materials based on external triggers and environments. Here, we show the soft-crystal copolymerization of green-luminescent Tb(III) and yellow-luminescent Dy(III) coordination centers. Soft-crystal polymerization is achieved via transformation of monomeric dinuclear complexes and polymeric structures with respect to coordination number and geometry. The structural transformation is characterized using single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction. The connected Tb(III) crystal-Dy(III) crystal show photon energy transfer from the Dy(III) centre to the Tb(III) centre under blue light excitation (selective Dy(III) centre excitation: 460 ± 10 nm). The activation energy of the energy transfer is estimated using the temperature-dependent emission lifetimes and emission quantum yields, and time-dependent density functional theory (B3LYP) calculations. Luminescence-conductive polymers, photonic molecular trains, are successfully prepared via soft-crystal polymerization on crystal media with remarkable long-range energy migration.","Soft-crystals are molecular solids with highly ordered structures. Here, authors report the soft-crystal copolymerization of green-luminescent Tb(III) and yellow-luminescent Dy(III) complexes, and study the long-range energy transfer from one crystal to the other.",2022-07-05
1601,"Oxygen isotope (δ18O, Δ′17O) insights into continental mantle evolution since the Archean","Oxygen isotopic ratios are largely homogenous in the bulk of Earth’s mantle but are strongly fractionated near the Earth’s surface, thus these are robust indicators of recycling of surface materials to the mantle. Here we document a subtle but significant ~0.2‰ temporal decrease in δ18O in the shallowest continental lithospheric mantle since the Archean, no change in Δ′17O is observed. Younger samples document a decrease and greater heterogeneity of δ18O due to the development and progression of plate tectonics and subduction. We posit that δ18O in the oldest Archean samples provides the best δ18O estimate for the Earth of 5.37‰ for olivine and 5.57‰ for bulk peridotite, values that are comparable to lunar rocks as the moon did not have plate tectonics. Given the large volume of the continental lithospheric mantle, even small decreases in its δ18O may explain the increasing δ18O of the continental crust since oxygen is progressively redistributed by fluids between these reservoirs via high-δ18O sediment accretion and low-δ18O mantle in subduction zones.","The 18 O/16 O ratio of the subcontinental mantle has decreased by 0.2‰, while crustal values increased by 4‰ via fluid transfer since the Archean due to the initiation of plate tectonics and subduction, in line with the crust-upper mantle mass balance",2022-07-04
1602,Ultralow-voltage operation of light-emitting diodes,"For a light-emitting diode (LED) to generate light, the minimum voltage required is widely considered to be the emitter’s bandgap divided by the elementary charge. Here we show for many classes of LEDs, including those based on perovskite, organic, quantum-dot and III–V semiconductors, light emission can be observed at record-low voltages of 36–60% of their bandgaps, exhibiting a large apparent energy gain of 0.6–1.4 eV per photon. For 17 types of LEDs with different modes of charge injection and recombination (dark saturation currents of ~10−39–10−15 mA cm−2), their emission intensity-voltage curves under low voltages show similar behaviours. These observations and their consistency with the diode simulations suggest the ultralow-voltage electroluminescence arises from a universal origin—the radiative recombination of non-thermal-equilibrium band-edge carriers whose populations are determined by the Fermi-Dirac function perturbed by a small external bias. These results indicate the potential of low-voltage LEDs for communications, computational and energy applications.","Light emission from 17 types of LEDs is observed at record-low voltages of 36–60% of the bandgaps, which cannot be explained by earlier theories. The electroluminescence-voltage curves reveal a unified mechanism for ultralow-voltage LED operation.",2022-07-04
1603,Engineering probiotics to inhibit Clostridioides difficile infection by dynamic regulation of intestinal metabolism,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) results in significant morbidity and mortality in hospitalised patients. The pathogenesis of CDI is intrinsically related to the ability of C. difficile to shuffle between active vegetative cells and dormant endospores through the processes of germination and sporulation. Here, we hypothesise that dysregulation of microbiome-mediated bile salt metabolism contributes to CDI and that its alleviation can limit the pathogenesis of CDI. We engineer a genetic circuit harbouring a genetically encoded sensor, amplifier and actuator in probiotics to restore intestinal bile salt metabolism in response to antibiotic-induced microbiome dysbiosis. We demonstrate that the engineered probiotics limited the germination of endospores and the growth of vegetative cells of C. difficile in vitro and further significantly reduced CDI in model mice, as evidenced by a 100% survival rate and improved clinical outcomes. Our work presents an antimicrobial strategy that harnesses the host-pathogen microenvironment as the intervention target to limit the pathogenesis of infection.","Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) results in significant morbidity and mortality in hospitalised patients. Here the authors engineer probiotics to restore intestinal bile salt metabolism in response to antibiotic-induced microbiome dysbiosis significantly inhibit Clostridioides difficile infection in model mice, presenting a microbiome-based antimicrobial strategy",2022-07-04
1604,Neutralization capacity of antibodies elicited through homologous or heterologous infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs,"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants raise questions about escape from previous immunity. As the population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has become more complex due to prior infections with different variants, vaccinations or the combination of both, understanding the antigenic relationship between variants is needed. Here, we have assessed neutralizing capacity of 120 blood specimens from convalescent individuals infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta, double vaccinated individuals and patients after breakthrough infections with Delta or Omicron-BA.1. Neutralization against seven authentic SARS-CoV-2 isolates (B.1, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Zeta and Omicron-BA.1) determined by plaque-reduction neutralization assay allowed us to map the antigenic relationship of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Highest neutralization titers were observed against the homologous variant. Antigenic cartography identified Zeta and Omicron-BA.1 as separate antigenic clusters. Substantial immune escape in vaccinated individuals was detected for Omicron-BA.1 but not Zeta. Combined infection/vaccination derived immunity results in less Omicron-BA.1 immune escape. Last, breakthrough infections with Omicron-BA.1 lead to broadly neutralizing sera.","Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants raise concerns on protective immunity. Here the authors show that convalescent sera from people infected with Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta show a significant drop of Omicron-BA.1 neutralization and that vaccine-breakthrough infections with Omicron-BA.1 or Delta result in robust neutralization for both Delta and Omicron-BA.1.",2022-07-04
1605,Renal UTX-PHGDH-serine axis regulates metabolic disorders in the kidney and liver,"Global obesity epidemics impacts human health and causes obesity-related illnesses, including the obesity-related kidney and liver diseases. UTX, a histone H3K27 demethylase, plays important roles in development and differentiation. Here we show that kidney-specific knockout Utx inhibits high-fat diet induced lipid accumulation in the kidney and liver via upregulating circulating serine levels. Mechanistically, UTX recruits E3 ligase RNF114 to ubiquitinate phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, the rate limiting enzyme for de novo serine synthesis, at Lys310 and Lys330, which leads to its degradation, and thus suppresses renal and circulating serine levels. Consistently, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and serine levels are markedly downregulated in human subjects with diabetic kidney disease or obesity-related renal dysfunction. Notably, oral administration of serine ameliorates high-fat diet induced fatty liver and renal dysfunction, suggesting a potential approach against obesity related metabolic disorders. Together, our results reveal a metabolic homeostasis regulation mediated by a renal UTX-PHGDH-serine axis.","Chen et al. report on a renal UTX-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase axis that regulates serine secretion to affect lipid metabolism in the kidney and liver upon over-nutrition, suggesting potential treatment targets for obesity-related diseases.",2022-07-04
1606,Sex differences in heart mitochondria regulate diastolic dysfunction,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) exhibits a sex bias, being more common in women than men, and we hypothesize that mitochondrial sex differences might underlie this bias. As part of genetic studies of heart failure in mice, we observe that heart mitochondrial DNA levels and function tend to be reduced in females as compared to males. We also observe that expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are higher in males than females in human cohorts. We test our hypothesis in a panel of genetically diverse inbred strains of mice, termed the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP). Indeed, we find that mitochondrial gene expression is highly correlated with diastolic function, a key trait in HFpEF. Consistent with this, studies of a “two-hit” mouse model of HFpEF confirm that mitochondrial function differs between sexes and is strongly associated with a number of HFpEF traits. By integrating data from human heart failure and the mouse HMDP cohort, we identify the mitochondrial gene Acsl6 as a genetic determinant of diastolic function. We validate its role in HFpEF using adenoviral over-expression in the heart. We conclude that sex differences in mitochondrial function underlie, in part, the sex bias in diastolic function.","In this paper, the authors show that sex differences in mitochondrial DNA levels and function in the heart contribute to sex biases in functions relevant to heart failure, identifying Acsl6 as a mitochondrial sex-biased regulator of diastolic function.",2022-07-04
1607,Calcium-tin alloys as anodes for rechargeable non-aqueous calcium-ion batteries at room temperature,"Rechargeable calcium batteries possess attractive features for sustainable energy-storage solutions owing to their high theoretical energy densities, safety aspects and abundant natural resources. However, divalent Ca-ions and reactive Ca metal strongly interact with cathode materials and non-aqueous electrolyte solutions, leading to high charge-transfer barriers at the electrode-electrolyte interface and consequently low electrochemical performance. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and elucidate the electrochemical properties of calcium-tin (Ca–Sn) alloy anodes for Ca-ion chemistries. Crystallographic and microstructural characterizations reveal that Sn formed from electrochemically dealloying the Ca–Sn alloy possesses unique properties, and that this in-situ formed Sn undergoes subsequent reversible calciation/decalciation as CaSn3. As demonstration of the suitability of Ca–Sn alloys as anodes for Ca-ion batteries, we assemble coin cells with an organic cathode (1,4-polyanthraquinone) in an electrolyte of 0.25 M calcium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate in dimethoxyethane. These electrochemical cells are charged/discharged for 5000 cycles at 260 mA g−1, retaining a capacity of 78 mAh g−1 with respect to the organic cathode. The discovery of new class of Ca–Sn alloy anodes opens a promising avenue towards viable high-performance Ca-ion batteries.","The key challenge for rechargeable Ca batteries originates from the severe passivation of the calcium metal anode in electrolyte solutions. Here, the authors demonstrate the feasibility and elucidate the electrochemical properties of calcium-tin (Ca–Sn) alloy anodes for rechargeable Ca batteries.",2022-07-04
1608,Structures of the T cell potassium channel Kv1.3 with immunoglobulin modulators,"The Kv1.3 potassium channel is expressed abundantly on activated T cells and mediates the cellular immune response. This role has made the channel a target for therapeutic immunomodulation to block its activity and suppress T cell activation. Here, we report structures of human Kv1.3 alone, with a nanobody inhibitor, and with an antibody-toxin fusion blocker. Rather than block the channel directly, four copies of the nanobody bind the tetramer’s voltage sensing domains and the pore domain to induce an inactive pore conformation. In contrast, the antibody-toxin fusion docks its toxin domain at the extracellular mouth of the channel to insert a critical lysine into the pore. The lysine stabilizes an active conformation of the pore yet blocks ion permeation. This study visualizes Kv1.3 pore dynamics, defines two distinct mechanisms to suppress Kv1.3 channel activity with exogenous inhibitors, and provides a framework to aid development of emerging T cell immunotherapies.","The Kv1.3 potassium channel is expressed abundantly on activated T cells and mediates the cellular immune responses. Here, the authors report structures of the Kv1.3 potassium channel with and without immunoglobulin modulators, shedding light on the mechanisms of Kv1.3 gating and modulation.",2022-07-04
1609,Magnetic molecules as local sensors of topological hysteresis of superconductors,"Superconductors and magnetic materials, including molecules, are key ingredients for quantum computing and spintronics. However, only a little is known about how these materials interact in multilayer nanostructures like the hybrid architectures nowadays under development for such advanced applications. Here, we show that a single layer of magnetic molecules, Terbium(III) bis-phthalocyaninato (TbPc2) complexes, deposited under controlled UHV conditions on a superconducting Pb(111) surface is sensitive to the topology of the intermediate state of the superconductor, namely to the presence and evolution of superconducting and normal domains due to screening and penetration of an external magnetic field. The topological hysteresis of the superconducting substrate imprints a local evolution of the magnetisation of the TbPc2 molecules in the monolayer. Element and surface selective detection is achieved by recording the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism of the Tb atoms. This study reveals the impressive potential of magnetic molecules for sensing local magnetic field variations in molecular/superconductor hybrid devices, including spin resonators or spin injecting and spin filtering components for spintronics applications.","Magnetic molecules have long been seen to hold promise in magnetic sensing applications. In this paper, Serrano et al show that a single layer of a magnetic molecule, a terbium based complex, is sensitive to the local magnetic field variation of a superconducting surface on which it is deposited.",2022-07-04
1610,Design principles for water dissociation catalysts in high-performance bipolar membranes,"Water dissociation (WD, H2O → H+ + OH−) is the core process in bipolar membranes (BPMs) that limits energy efficiency. Both electric-field and catalytic effects have been invoked to describe WD, but the interplay of the two and the underlying design principles for WD catalysts remain unclear. Using precise layers of metal-oxide nanoparticles, membrane-electrolyzer platforms, materials characterization, and impedance analysis, we illustrate the role of electronic conductivity in modulating the performance of WD catalysts in the BPM junction through screening and focusing the interfacial electric field and thus electrochemical potential gradients. In contrast, the ionic conductivity of the same layer is not a significant factor in limiting performance. BPM water electrolyzers, optimized via these findings, use ~30-nm-diameter anatase TiO2 as an earth-abundant WD catalyst, and generate O2 and H2 at 500 mA cm−2 with a record-low total cell voltage below 2 V. These advanced BPMs might accelerate deployment of new electrodialysis, carbon-capture, and carbon-utilization technology.",It is important yet challenging to elucidate the mechanism of water dissociation in bipolar membrane electrolysers. Here the authors show how water dissociation is accelerated by electric-field-focusing and catalytic effects and uncover design principles to optimize the performance.,2022-07-04
1611,Flexible ultrasound-induced retinal stimulating piezo-arrays for biomimetic visual prostheses,"Electronic visual prostheses, or biomimetic eyes, have shown the feasibility of restoring functional vision in the blind through electrical pulses to initiate neural responses artificially. However, existing visual prostheses predominantly use wired connections or electromagnetic waves for powering and data telemetry, which raises safety concerns or couples inefficiently to miniaturized implant units. Here, we present a flexible ultrasound-induced retinal stimulating piezo-array that can offer an alternative wireless artificial retinal prosthesis approach for evoking visual percepts in blind individuals. The device integrates a two-dimensional piezo-array with 32-pixel stimulating electrodes in a flexible printed circuit board. Each piezo-element can be ultrasonically and individually activated, thus, spatially reconfigurable electronic patterns can be dynamically applied via programmable ultrasound beamlines. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the ultrasound-induced pattern reconstruction in ex vivo murine retinal tissue, showing the potential of this approach to restore functional, life-enhancing vision in people living with blindness.","Electronic visual prostheses, or biomimetic eyes, have shown capability of restoring functional vision through electrical pulses artificially initiating neural responses.

1612,Self-evolving vision transformer for chest X-ray diagnosis through knowledge distillation,"Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis systems have recently achieved expert-level performance, developing a robust model requires large, high-quality data with annotations that are expensive to obtain. This situation poses a conundrum that annually-collected chest x-rays cannot be utilized due to the absence of labels, especially in deprived areas. In this study, we present a framework named distillation for self-supervision and self-train learning (DISTL) inspired by the learning process of the radiologists, which can improve the performance of vision transformer simultaneously with self-supervision and self-training through knowledge distillation. In external validation from three hospitals for diagnosis of tuberculosis, pneumothorax, and COVID-19, DISTL offers gradually improved performance as the amount of unlabeled data increase, even better than the fully supervised model with the same amount of labeled data. We additionally show that the model obtained with DISTL is robust to various real-world nuisances, offering better applicability in clinical setting.","Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis systems have recently achieved expert level performance, developing a robust model requires large, high-quality data with annotations.

1613,"Myotonic dystrophy RNA toxicity alters morphology, adhesion and migration of mouse and human astrocytes","Brain dysfunction in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the prototype of toxic RNA disorders, has been mainly attributed to neuronal RNA misprocessing, while little attention has been given to non-neuronal brain cells. Here, using a transgenic mouse model of DM1 that expresses mutant RNA in various brain cell types (neurons, astroglia, and oligodendroglia), we demonstrate that astrocytes exhibit impaired ramification and polarization in vivo and defects in adhesion, spreading, and migration. RNA-dependent toxicity and phenotypes are also found in human transfected glial cells. In line with the cell phenotypes, molecular analyses reveal extensive expression and accumulation of toxic RNA in astrocytes, which result in RNA spliceopathy that is more severe than in neurons. Astrocyte missplicing affects primarily transcripts that regulate cell adhesion, cytoskeleton, and morphogenesis, and it is confirmed in human brain tissue. Our findings demonstrate that DM1 impacts astrocyte cell biology, possibly compromising their support and regulation of synaptic function.",Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is characterized by debilitating neurological symptoms.

1614,General recipe to realize photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers with 100-W-to-1-kW single-mode operation,"Realization of one-chip, ultra-large-area, coherent semiconductor lasers has been one of the ultimate goals of laser physics and photonics for decades. Surface-emitting lasers with two-dimensional photonic crystal resonators, referred to as photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs), are expected to show promise for this purpose. However, neither the general conditions nor the concrete photonic crystal structures to realize 100-W-to-1-kW-class single-mode operation in PCSELs have yet to be clarified. Here, we analytically derive the general conditions for ultra-large-area (3~10 mm) single-mode operation in PCSELs. By considering not only the Hermitian but also the non-Hermitian optical couplings inside PCSELs, we mathematically derive the complex eigenfrequencies of the four photonic bands around the Γ point as well as the radiation constant difference between the fundamental and higher-order modes in a finite-size device. We then reveal concrete photonic crystal structures which allow the control of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian coupling coefficients to achieve 100-W-to-1-kW-class single-mode lasing.","Here, the authors analytically derive the general conditions for 100-W-to-1-kW-class single-mode operation in ultra-large-area (3~10 mm) photonic crystal lasers.

1615,3D and 2D aromatic units behave like oil and water in the case of benzocarborane derivatives,"A large number of 2D/2D and 3D/3D aromatic fusions that keep their aromaticity in the fused compounds have been synthesized. In addition, we have previously proven the electronic relationship between the 3D aromaticity of boron hydrides and the 2D aromaticity of PAHs. Here we report the possible existence of 3D/2D aromatic fusions that retain the whole aromaticity of the two units. Our conclusion is that such a 3D/2D aromatic combination is not possible due to the ineffective overlap between the π-MOs of the planar species and the n + 1 molecular orbitals in the aromatic cage that deter an effective electronic delocalization between the two fused units. We have also proven the necessary conditions for 3D/3D fusions to take place, and how aromaticity of each unit is decreased in 2D/2D and 3D/3D fusions.","2D/2D fusion of aromatic halves leading to a global aromatic is found in many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, whereas 2D/3D aromaticity is difficult to achieve.

1616,Dispersal and fire limit Arctic shrub expansion,"Arctic shrub expansion alters carbon budgets, albedo, and warming rates in high latitudes but remains challenging to predict due to unclear underlying controls. Observational studies and models typically use relationships between observed shrub presence and current environmental suitability (bioclimate and topography) to predict shrub expansion, while omitting shrub demographic processes and non-stationary response to changing climate. Here, we use high-resolution satellite imagery across Alaska and western Canada to show that observed shrub expansion has not been controlled by environmental suitability during 1984–2014, but can only be explained by considering seed dispersal and fire. These findings provide the impetus for better observations of recruitment and for incorporating currently underrepresented processes of seed dispersal and fire in land models to project shrub expansion and climate feedbacks. Integrating these dynamic processes with projected fire extent and climate, we estimate shrubs will expand into 25% of the non-shrub tundra by 2100, in contrast to 39% predicted based on increasing environmental suitability alone. Thus, using environmental suitability alone likely overestimates and misrepresents shrub expansion pattern and its associated carbon sink.",Shrub encroachment trends are widespread yet complex. Here the authors demonstrate that not considering dispersal and fire leads to overestimating shrub expansion in Arctic tundra and therefore its role as carbon sink.,2022-07-04
1617,Cigarette smoke aggravates asthma by inducing memory-like type 3 innate lymphoid cells,"Although cigarette smoking is known to exacerbate asthma, only a few clinical asthma studies have been conducted involving smokers. Here we show, by comparing paired sputum and blood samples from smoking and non-smoking patients with asthma, that smoking associates with significantly higher frequencies of pro-inflammatory, natural-cytotoxicity-receptor-non-expressing type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in the sputum and memory-like, CD45RO-expressing ILC3s in the blood. These ILC3 frequencies positively correlate with circulating neutrophil counts and M1 alveolar macrophage frequencies, which are known to increase in uncontrolled severe asthma, yet do not correlate with circulating eosinophil frequencies that characterize allergic asthma. In vitro exposure of ILCs to cigarette smoke extract induces expression of the memory marker CD45RO in ILC3s. Cigarette smoke extract also impairs the barrier function of airway epithelial cells and increases their production of IL-1β, which is a known activating factor for ILC3s. Thus, our study suggests that cigarette smoking increases local and circulating frequencies of activated ILC3 cells, plays a role in their activation, thereby aggravating non-allergic inflammation and the severity of asthma.","Cigarette smoking may exacerbate asthma, but the underlying mechanisms have not been studied extensively in human patients. Here authors show that type 3 innate lymphoid cells with activated phenotypes are found in the sputum and blood of smokers in higher frequencies, which might result in the aggravation of asthma.",2022-07-04
1618,Accelerated western European heatwave trends linked to more-persistent double jets over Eurasia,"Persistent heat extremes can have severe impacts on ecosystems and societies, including excess mortality, wildfires, and harvest failures. Here we identify Europe as a heatwave hotspot, exhibiting upward trends that are three-to-four times faster compared to the rest of the northern midlatitudes over the past 42 years. This accelerated trend is linked to atmospheric dynamical changes via an increase in the frequency and persistence of double jet stream states over Eurasia. We find that double jet occurrences are particularly important for western European heatwaves, explaining up to 35% of temperature variability. The upward trend in the persistence of double jet events explains almost all of the accelerated heatwave trend in western Europe, and about 30% of it over the extended European region. Those findings provide evidence that in addition to thermodynamical drivers, atmospheric dynamical changes have contributed to the increased rate of European heatwaves, with implications for risk management and potential adaptation strategies.","Europe is a heatwave hotspot exhibiting three-to-four times faster upward trends compared to the rest of the northern midlatitudes. Here, this accelerated trend is linked to the increased persistence of Eurasian double jets in the upper troposphere.",2022-07-04
1619,Clonal barcoding with qPCR detection enables live cell functional analyses for cancer research,"Single-cell analysis methods are valuable tools; however, current approaches do not easily enable live cell retrieval. That is a particular issue when further study of cells that were eliminated during experimentation could provide critical information. We report a clonal molecular barcoding method, called SunCatcher, that enables longitudinal tracking and live cell functional analysis. From complex cell populations, we generate single cell-derived clonal populations, infect each with a unique molecular barcode, and retain stocks of individual barcoded clones (BCs). We develop quantitative PCR-based and next-generation sequencing methods that we employ to identify and quantify BCs in vitro and in vivo. We apply SunCatcher to various breast cancer cell lines and combine respective BCs to create versions of the original cell lines. While the heterogeneous BC pools reproduce their original parental cell line proliferation and tumor progression rates, individual BCs are phenotypically and functionally diverse. Early spontaneous metastases can also be identified and quantified. SunCatcher thus provides a rapid and sensitive approach for studying live single-cell clones and clonal evolution, and performing functional analyses.","DNA barcoding methods for the analysis of clonal heterogeneity in cancer have been limited in terms of throughput and practical requirements.

Here, we report cryo-EM structures of wild-type human Best1 and Best2 in various states at up to 1.8 Å resolution. Ca2+-bound Best1 structures illustrate partially open conformations at the two Ca2+-dependent gates of the channels, in contrast to the fully open conformations observed in Ca2+-bound Best2, which is in accord with the significantly smaller currents conducted by Best1 in electrophysiological recordings. Comparison of the closed and open states reveals a C-terminal auto-inhibitory segment (AS), which constricts the channel concentrically by wrapping around the channel periphery in an inter-protomer manner and must be released to allow channel opening. Our results demonstrate that removing the AS from Best1 and Best2 results in truncation mutants with similar activities, while swapping the AS between Best1 and Best2 results in chimeric mutants with swapped activities, underlying a key role of the AS in determining paralog specificity among bestrophins.","Bestrophin channels are critical for physiology of the eye. Here, authors report cryo-EM structures of human bestrophins in various states at up to 1.8 Å resolution, revealing paralog-specific features that underlie molecular mechanisms of permeation.",2022-07-04
1621,A-site cation influence on the conduction band of lead bromide perovskites,"Hot carrier solar cells hold promise for exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit. Slow hot carrier cooling is one of the most intriguing properties of lead halide perovskites and distinguishes this class of materials from competing materials used in solar cells. Here we use the element selectivity of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory to uncover a previously hidden feature in the conduction band states, the σ-π energy splitting, and find that it is strongly influenced by the strength of electronic coupling between the A-cation and bromide-lead sublattice. Our finding provides an alternative mechanism to the commonly discussed polaronic screening and hot phonon bottleneck carrier cooling mechanisms. Our work emphasizes the optoelectronic role of the A-cation, provides a comprehensive view of A-cation effects in the crystal and electronic structures, and outlines a broadly applicable spectroscopic approach for assessing the impact of chemical alterations of the A-cation on perovskite electronic structure.","The A-cation influence on the mechanism of slow hot carrier cooling in perovskites is controversial. Here, Man et al. resolve a debated issue regarding A-cation influence on the electronic structure of lead halide perovskites.",2022-07-04
1622,Elasticity of podosome actin networks produces nanonewton protrusive forces,"Actin filaments assemble into force-generating systems involved in diverse cellular functions, including cell motility, adhesion, contractility and division. It remains unclear how networks of actin filaments, which individually generate piconewton forces, can produce forces reaching tens of nanonewtons. Here we use in situ cryo-electron tomography to unveil how the nanoscale architecture of macrophage podosomes enables basal membrane protrusion. We show that the sum of the actin polymerization forces at the membrane is not sufficient to explain podosome protrusive forces. Quantitative analysis of podosome organization demonstrates that the core is composed of a dense network of bent actin filaments storing elastic energy. Theoretical modelling of the network as a spring-loaded elastic material reveals that it exerts forces of a few tens of nanonewtons, in a range similar to that evaluated experimentally. Thus, taking into account not only the interface with the membrane but also the bulk of the network, is crucial to understand force generation by actin machineries. Our integrative approach sheds light on the elastic behavior of dense actin networks and opens new avenues to understand force production inside cells.","Actin filaments generate force in diverse contexts, although how they can produce nanonewtons of force is unclear. Here, the authors apply cryo-electron tomography, quantitative analysis, and modelling to reveal the podosome core is a dense, spring-loaded, actin network storing elastic energy.",2022-07-04
1623,The splicing factor RBM17 drives leukemic stem cell maintenance by evading nonsense-mediated decay of pro-leukemic factors,"Chemo-resistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is driven by leukemic stem cells (LSCs) resulting in high rates of relapse and low overall survival. Here, we demonstrate that upregulation of the splicing factor, RBM17 preferentially marks and sustains LSCs and directly correlates with shorten patient survival. RBM17 knockdown in primary AML cells leads to myeloid differentiation and impaired colony formation and in vivo engraftment. Integrative multi-omics analyses show that RBM17 repression leads to inclusion of poison exons and production of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-sensitive transcripts for pro-leukemic factors and the translation initiation factor, EIF4A2. We show that EIF4A2 is enriched in LSCs and its inhibition impairs primary AML progenitor activity. Proteomic analysis of EIF4A2-depleted AML cells shows recapitulation of the RBM17 knockdown biological effects, including pronounced suppression of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis. Overall, these results provide a rationale to target RBM17 and/or its downstream NMD-sensitive splicing substrates for AML treatment.","Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) drive chemoresistance and relapse in acute myeloid leukemia. Here, the authors show that the splicing factor RBM17 supports LSCs through avoiding nonsense-mediated decay of pro-leukaemic factors such as the translation initiation factor EIF4A2.",2022-07-04
1624,Photo-tailored heterocrystalline covalent organic framework membranes for organics separation,"Organics separation for purifying and recycling environment-detrimental solvents is essential to sustainable chemical industries. Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold great promise in affording precise and fast organics separation. Nonetheless, how to well coordinate facile processing—high crystalline structure—high separation performance remains a critical issue and a grand challenge. Herein, we propose a concept of heterocrystalline membrane which comprises high-crystalline regions and low-crystalline regions. The heterocrystalline COF membranes are fabricated by a two-step procedure, i.e., dark reaction for the construction of high-crystalline regions followed by photo reaction for the construction of low-crystalline regions, thus linking the high-crystalline regions tightly and flexibly, blocking the defect in high-crystalline regions. Accordingly, the COF membrane exhibits sharp molecular sieving properties with high organic solvent permeance up to 44-times higher than the state-of-the-art membranes.","Covalent organic frameworks (COF) hold great promise in filtration and separation but combining facile processing, high crystallinity and high separation performance remains challenging. Here, the authors demonstrate that heterocrystalline COF membranes in which high-crystalline regions are tightly linked by low-crystalline regions can improve molecular sieving properties at high solvent flux.",2022-07-02
1625,Electroredox carbene organocatalysis with iodide as promoter,"Oxidative carbene organocatalysis, inspired from Vitamin B1 catalyzed oxidative activation from pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A, have been developed as a versatile synthetic method. To date, the α-, β-, γ-, δ- and carbonyl carbons of (unsaturated)aldehydes have been successfully activated via oxidative N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis. In comparison with chemical redox or photoredox methods, electroredox methods, although widely used in mechanistic study, were much less developed in NHC catalyzed organic synthesis. Herein, an iodide promoted electroredox NHC organocatalysis system was developed. This system provided general solutions for electrochemical single-electron-transfer (SET) oxidation of Breslow intermediate towards versatile transformations. Radical clock experiment and cyclic voltammetry results suggested an anodic radical coupling pathway.","Oxidative carbene organocatalysis has been developed as a versatile synthetic method, but has been paired with electroredox chemistry in only limited examples. Herein, enantioenriched heterocycles are synthesized from racemic substrates via an iodide-promoted NHC organocatalysis system that is powered by electroredox chemistry.",2022-07-02
1626,Green gentrification in European and North American cities,"Although urban greening is universally recognized as an essential part of sustainable and climate-responsive cities, a growing literature on green gentrification argues that new green infrastructure, and greenspace in particular, can contribute to gentrification, thus creating social and racial inequalities in access to the benefits of greenspace and further environmental and climate injustice. In response to limited quantitative evidence documenting the temporal relationship between new greenspaces and gentrification across entire cities, let alone across various international contexts, we employ a spatially weighted Bayesian model to test the green gentrification hypothesis across 28 cities in 9 countries in North America and Europe. Here we show a strong positive and relevant relationship for at least one decade between greening in the 1990s–2000s and gentrification that occurred between 2000–2016 in 17 of the 28 cities. Our results also determine whether greening plays a “lead”, “integrated”, or “subsidiary” role in explaining gentrification.",The relationship between new greenspaces and gentrification is an important one for urbanization. Here the authors show a positive relationship for at least one decade between greening in the 1990s–2000s and gentrification that occurred between 2000–2016 in 17 of 28 studied cities in North America and Europe.,2022-07-02
1627,Adenine oligomer directed synthesis of chiral gold nanoparticles,"Precise control of morphology and optical response of 3-dimensional chiral nanoparticles remain as a significant challenge. This work demonstrates chiral gold nanoparticle synthesis using single-stranded oligonucleotide as a chiral shape modifier. The homo-oligonucleotide composed of Adenine nucleobase specifically show a distinct chirality development with a dissymmetric factor up to g ~ 0.04 at visible wavelength, whereas other nucleobases show no development of chirality. The synthesized nanoparticle shows a counter-clockwise rotation of generated chiral arms with approximately 200 nm edge length. The molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations reveal that Adenine shows the highest enantioselective interaction with Au(321)R/S facet in terms of binding orientation and affinity. This is attributed to the formation of sequence-specific intra-strand hydrogen bonding between nucleobases. We also found that different sequence programming of Adenine-and Cytosine-based oligomers result in chiral gold nanoparticles’ morphological and optical change. These results extend our understanding of the biomolecule-directed synthesis of chiral gold nanoparticles to sequence programmable deoxyribonucleic acid and provides a foundation for programmable synthesis of chiral gold nanoparticles.","Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles are of great interest in nanotechnology. Here, the authors demonstrate chiral shape guidance by single-stranded oligonucleotides during particle growth based on sequence-specific hydrogen bonding within the strand.",2022-07-02
1628,Single-molecule FRET uncovers hidden conformations and dynamics of human Argonaute 2,"Human Argonaute 2 (hAgo2) constitutes the functional core of the RNA interference pathway. Guide RNAs direct hAgo2 to target mRNAs, which ultimately leads to hAgo2-mediated mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. Here, we combine site-specifically labeled hAgo2 with time-resolved single-molecule FRET measurements to monitor conformational states and dynamics of hAgo2 and hAgo2-RNA complexes in solution that remained elusive so far. We observe dynamic anchoring and release of the guide’s 3’-end from the PAZ domain during the stepwise target loading process even with a fully complementary target. We find differences in structure and dynamic behavior between partially and fully paired canonical hAgo2-guide/target complexes and the miRNA processing complex formed by hAgo2 and pre-miRNA451. Furthermore, we detect a hitherto unknown conformation of hAgo2-guide/target complexes that poises them for target-directed miRNA degradation. Taken together, our results show how the conformational flexibility of hAgo2-RNA complexes determines function and the fate of the ribonucleoprotein particle.",Single-molecule FRET measurements provide detailed insights into the conformational states and dynamics of human Argonaute 2 that are required for its function at the core of the eukaryotic RNA silencing pathway.,2022-07-02
1629,Investigation of the monopole magneto-chemical potential in spin ices using capacitive torque magnetometry,"The single-ion anisotropy and magnetic interactions in spin-ice systems give rise to unusual non-collinear spin textures, such as Pauling states and magnetic monopoles. The effective spin correlation strength (Jeff) determines the relative energies of the different spin-ice states. With this work, we display the capability of capacitive torque magnetometry in characterizing the magneto-chemical potential associated with monopole formation. We build a magnetic phase diagram of Ho2Ti2O7, and show that the magneto-chemical potential depends on the spin sublattice (α or β), i.e., the Pauling state, involved in the transition. Monte Carlo simulations using the dipolar-spin-ice Hamiltonian support our findings of a sublattice-dependent magneto-chemical potential, but the model underestimates the Jeff for the β-sublattice. Additional simulations, including next-nearest neighbor interactions (J2), show that long-range exchange terms in the Hamiltonian are needed to describe the measurements. This demonstrates that torque magnetometry provides a sensitive test for Jeff and the spin-spin interactions that contribute to it.","Magnetic-field induced phase transitions in spin-ice materials have been investigated with various experimental techniques. Here, the authors demonstrate the capability of capacitive torque magnetometry in probing magnetic interaction energies and establishing magnetic phase boundaries in Ho2Ti2O7.",2022-07-02
1630,The megabase-scale crossover landscape is largely independent of sequence divergence,"Meiotic recombination frequency varies along chromosomes and strongly correlates with sequence divergence. However, the causal relationship between recombination landscapes and polymorphisms is unclear. Here, we characterize the genome-wide recombination landscape in the quasi-absence of polymorphisms, using Arabidopsis thaliana homozygous inbred lines in which a few hundred genetic markers were introduced through mutagenesis. We find that megabase-scale recombination landscapes in inbred lines are strikingly similar to the recombination landscapes in hybrids, with the notable exception of heterozygous large rearrangements where recombination is prevented locally. In addition, the megabase-scale recombination landscape can be largely explained by chromatin features. Our results show that polymorphisms are not a major determinant of the shape of the megabase-scale recombination landscape but rather favour alternative models in which recombination and chromatin shape sequence divergence across the genome.","The frequency of recombination varies along chromosomes and highly correlates with sequence divergence. Here, the authors show that polymorphisms are not a major determinant of the megabase-scale recombination landscape in Arabidopsis, which is rather determined by chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation.",2022-07-02
1631,A convolutional neural network highlights mutations relevant to antimicrobial resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"Long diagnostic wait times hinder international efforts to address antibiotic resistance in M. tuberculosis. Pathogen whole genome sequencing, coupled with statistical and machine learning models, offers a promising solution. However, generalizability and clinical adoption have been limited by a lack of interpretability, especially in deep learning methods. Here, we present two deep convolutional neural networks that predict antibiotic resistance phenotypes of M. tuberculosis isolates: a multi-drug CNN (MD-CNN), that predicts resistance to 13 antibiotics based on 18 genomic loci, with AUCs 82.6-99.5% and higher sensitivity than state-of-the-art methods; and a set of 13 single-drug CNNs (SD-CNN) with AUCs 80.1-97.1% and higher specificity than the previous state-of-the-art. Using saliency methods to evaluate the contribution of input sequence features to the SD-CNN predictions, we identify 18 sites in the genome not previously associated with resistance. The CNN models permit functional variant discovery, biologically meaningful interpretation, and clinical applicability.","Pathogen whole genome sequencing, coupled with statistical and machine learning models, offers a promising solution to multi-drug resistance diagnosis. Here, the authors present two deep convolutional neural networks that predict the antibiotic resistance phenotypes of M. tuberculosis isolates.",2022-07-02
1632,Resilience of S309 and AZD7442 monoclonal antibody treatments against infection by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage strains,"Omicron variant strains encode large numbers of changes in the spike protein compared to historical SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Although in vitro studies have suggested that several monoclonal antibody therapies lose neutralizing activity against Omicron variants, the effects in vivo remain largely unknown. Here, we report on the protective efficacy against three SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage strains (BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2) of two monoclonal antibody therapeutics (S309 [Vir Biotechnology] monotherapy and AZD7442 [AstraZeneca] combination), which correspond to ones used to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. Despite losses in neutralization potency in cell culture, S309 or AZD7442 treatments reduced BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2 lung infection in susceptible mice that express human ACE2 (K18-hACE2) in prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Correlation analyses between in vitro neutralizing activity and reductions in viral burden in K18-hACE2 or human FcγR transgenic mice suggest that S309 and AZD7442 have different mechanisms of protection against Omicron variants, with S309 utilizing Fc effector function interactions and AZD7442 acting principally by direct neutralization. Our data in mice demonstrate the resilience of S309 and AZD7442 mAbs against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant strains and provide insight into the relationship between loss of antibody neutralization potency and retained protection in vivo.","SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are less susceptible to therapeutic neutralizing antibodies, given mutations in the surface glycoprotein S. Here, Case et al. show that therapeutic antibodies S309 and AZD7442 reduce lung infection with SARSCoV-2 Omicron lineages in humanized mouse model despite the loss of neutralizing potency in vitro.",2022-07-02
1633,Metabolomics-guided discovery of cytochrome P450s involved in pseudotropine-dependent biosynthesis of modified tropane alkaloids,"Plant alkaloids constitute an important class of bioactive chemicals with applications in medicine and agriculture. However, the knowledge gap of the diversity and biosynthesis of phytoalkaloids prevents systematic advances in biotechnology for engineered production of these high-value compounds. In particular, the identification of cytochrome P450s driving the structural diversity of phytoalkaloids has remained challenging. Here, we use a combination of reverse genetics with discovery metabolomics and multivariate statistical analysis followed by in planta transient assays to investigate alkaloid diversity and functionally characterize two candidate cytochrome P450s genes from Atropa belladonna without a priori knowledge of their functions or information regarding the identities of key pathway intermediates. This approach uncovered a largely unexplored root localized alkaloid sub-network that relies on pseudotropine as precursor. The two cytochrome P450s catalyze N-demethylation and ring-hydroxylation reactions within the early steps in the biosynthesis of diverse N-demethylated modified tropane alkaloids.","Cytochrome P450s drive the structural diversity of plant alkaloids, many of which have biotechnological uses. Here the authors use reverse genetics and metabolomics to identify two Atropa belladonna cytochrome P450s that synthesize pseudotropine-derived alkaloids.",2022-07-02
1634,Anti-dissolution Pt single site with Pt(OH)(O3)/Co(P) coordination for efficient alkaline water splitting electrolyzer,"As the most well-known electrocatalyst for cathodic hydrogen evolution in water splitting electrolyzers, platinum is unfortunately inefficient for anodic oxygen evolution due to its over-binding with oxygen species and excessive dissolution in oxidative environment. Herein we show that single Pt atoms dispersed in cobalt hydrogen phosphate with an unique Pt(OH)(O3)/Co(P) coordination can achieve remarkable catalytic activity and stability for oxygen evolution. The catalyst yields a high turnover frequency (35.1 ± 5.2 s−1) and mass activity (69.5 ± 10.3 A mg−1) at an overpotential of 300 mV and excellent stability. Mechanistic studies elucidate that the superior catalytic performance of isolated Pt atoms herein stems from optimal binding energies of oxygen intermediate and also their strong electronic coupling with neighboring Co atoms that suppresses the formation of soluble Ptx>4 species. Alkaline water electrolyzers assembled with an ultralow Pt loading realizes an industrial-level current density of 1 A cm−2 at 1.8 volts with a high durability.","Platinum is the most active catalyst for cathodic hydrogen evolution, however it is inefficient for anodic oxygen evolution. Here, authors examine Pt single sites in cobalt hydrogen phosphate as oxygen evolution catalysts in water splitting electrolyzers.",2022-07-02
1635,Acceptor engineering for NIR-II dyes with high photochemical and biomedical performance,"It is highly important and challenging to develop donor-acceptor-donor structured small-molecule second near-infrared window (NIR-II) dyes with excellent properties such as water-solubility and chem/photostability. Here, we discovery an electron acceptor, 6,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (TQT) with highest stability in alkaline conditions, compared with conventional NIR-II building block benzobisthiadiazole (BBT) and 6,7-diphenyl-[1,2,5] thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (PTQ). The sulfonated hydrophilic dye, FT-TQT, is further synthesized with 2.13-fold increased quantum yield than its counterpart FT-BBT with BBT as acceptor. FT-TQT complexed with FBS is also prepared and displays a 16-fold increase in fluorescence intensity compared to FT-TQT alone. It demonstrates real-time cerebral and tumor vessel imaging capability with µm-scale resolution. Dynamic monitoring of tumor vascular disruption after drug treatment is achieved by NIR-II fluorescent imaging. Overall, TQT is an efficient electron acceptor for designing innovative NIR-II dyes. The acceptor engineering strategy provides a promising approach to design next generation of NIR-II fluorophores which open new biomedical applications.","Small molecule NIR-II fluorophores are of interest for a range of applications but can suffer from chemical and photostability issues.

1636,Endosomal LC3C-pathway selectively targets plasma membrane cargo for autophagic degradation,"Autophagy selectively targets cargo for degradation, yet mechanistic understanding remains incomplete. The ATG8-family plays key roles in autophagic cargo recruitment. Here by mapping the proximal interactome of ATG8-paralogs, LC3B and LC3C, we uncover a LC3C-Endocytic-Associated-Pathway (LEAP) that selectively recruits plasma-membrane (PM) cargo to autophagosomes. We show that LC3C localizes to peripheral endosomes and engages proteins that traffic between PM, endosomes and autophagosomes, including the SNARE-VAMP3 and ATG9, a transmembrane protein essential for autophagy. We establish that endocytic LC3C binds cargo internalized from the PM, including the Met receptor tyrosine kinase and transferrin receptor, and is necessary for their recruitment into ATG9 vesicles targeted to sites of autophagosome initiation. Structure-function analysis identified that LC3C-endocytic localization and engagement with PM-cargo requires the extended carboxy-tail unique to LC3C, the TBK1 kinase, and TBK1-phosphosites on LC3C. These findings identify LEAP as an unexpected LC3C-dependent pathway, providing new understanding of selective coupling of PM signalling with autophagic degradation.","Autophagy can selectively target cargo for degradation. Here the authors map the proximal interactome of ATG8-paralogs LC3B and LC3C uncovering an LC3C-Endocytic-Associated-Pathway that selectively recruits internalized plasma membrane cargo, Met and transferrin receptors, to nascent autophagosomes.",2022-07-02
1637,Structure induced laminar vortices control anomalous dispersion in porous media,"Natural porous systems, such as soil, membranes, and biological tissues comprise disordered structures characterized by dead-end pores connected to a network of percolating channels. The release and dispersion of particles, solutes, and microorganisms from such features is key for a broad range of environmental and medical applications including soil remediation, filtration and drug delivery. Yet, owing to the stagnant and opaque nature of these disordered systems, the role of microscopic structure and flow on the dispersion of particles and solutes remains poorly understood. Here, we use a microfluidic model system that features a pore structure characterized by distributed dead-ends to determine how particles are transported, retained and dispersed. We observe strong tailing of arrival time distributions at the outlet of the medium characterized by power-law decay with an exponent of 2/3. Using numerical simulations and an analytical model, we link this behavior to particles initially located within dead-end pores, and explain the tailing exponent with a hopping across and rolling along the streamlines of vortices within dead-end pores. We quantify such anomalous dispersal by a stochastic model that predicts the full evolution of arrival times. Our results demonstrate how microscopic flow structures can impact macroscopic particle transport.","Most porous systems comprise structures characterized by dead-end and transmitting pores. Here, authors show that macroscopic transport through such porous medium is controlled by structure-induced laminar vortices inside each dead-end pore, and such cannot be explained by diffusion alone.",2022-07-02
1638,Unveiling the S=3/2 Kitaev honeycomb spin liquids,"The S=3/2 Kitaev honeycomb model (KHM) is a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state coupled to a static Z2 gauge field. Employing an SO(6) Majorana representation of spin3/2’s, we find an exact representation of the conserved plaquette fluxes in terms of static Z2 gauge fields akin to the S=1/2 KHM which enables us to treat the remaining interacting matter fermion sector in a parton mean-field theory. We uncover a ground-state phase diagram consisting of gapped and gapless QSLs. Our parton description is in quantitative agreement with numerical simulations, and is furthermore corroborated by the addition of a [001] single ion anisotropy (SIA) which continuously connects the gapless Dirac QSL of our model with that of the S=1/2 KHM. In the presence of a weak [111] SIA, we discuss an emergent chiral QSL within a perturbation theory.","Recently, material realizations of the spin 3/2 Kitaev honeycomb model have been proposed, but the model has not been solved by either analytical or numerical methods.

1639,Humidity response in Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons requires the mechanosensitive channel TMEM63,"Birds, reptiles and insects have the ability to discriminate humidity levels that influence their survival and geographic distribution. Insects are particularly susceptible to humidity changes due to high surface area to volume ratios, but it remains unclear how humidity sensors transduce humidity signals. Here we identified Or42b-expressing olfactory sensory neurons, which are required for moisture attraction in Drosophila. The sensilla housing Or42b neurons show cuticular deformations upon moist air stimuli, indicating a conversion of humidity into mechanical force. Accordingly, we found Or42b neurons directly respond to humidity changes and rely on the mechanosensitive ion channel TMEM63 to mediate humidity sensing (hygrosensation). Expressing human TMEM63B in Tmem63 mutant flies rescued their defective phenotype in moisture attraction, demonstrating functional conservation. Thus, our results reveal a role of Tmem63 in hygrosensation and support the strategy to detect humidity by transforming it into a mechanical stimulus, which is unique in sensory transduction.","Humidity detection is a feature of many species. Here the authors show that in Drosophila, Or42b neurons, located in sensilla with humidity-dependent shape act as humidity sensors via the mechanically gated channel TMEM63.",2022-07-02
1640,Rapid northern hemisphere ice sheet melting during the penultimate deglaciation,"The rate and consequences of future high latitude ice sheet retreat remain a major concern given ongoing anthropogenic warming. Here, new precisely dated stalagmite data from NW Iberia provide the first direct, high-resolution records of periods of rapid melting of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets during the penultimate deglaciation. These records reveal the penultimate deglaciation initiated with rapid century-scale meltwater pulses which subsequently trigger abrupt coolings of air temperature in NW Iberia consistent with freshwater-induced AMOC slowdowns. The first of these AMOC slowdowns, 600-year duration, was shorter than Heinrich 1 of the last deglaciation. Although similar insolation forcing initiated the last two deglaciations, the more rapid and sustained rate of freshening in the eastern North Atlantic penultimate deglaciation likely reflects a larger volume of ice stored in the marine-based Eurasian Ice sheet during the penultimate glacial in contrast to the land-based ice sheet on North America as during the last glacial.","Stalagmites from NW Iberia record the rapid demise of large ice sheets during the penultimate deglaciation, and reveal decadal-scale feedbacks between warming and ice melting.",2022-07-02
1641,Synthesis and direct assay of large macrocycle diversities by combinatorial late-stage modification at picomole scale,"Macrocycles have excellent potential as therapeutics due to their ability to bind challenging targets. However, generating macrocycles against new targets is hindered by a lack of large macrocycle libraries for high-throughput screening. To overcome this, we herein established a combinatorial approach by tethering a myriad of chemical fragments to peripheral groups of structurally diverse macrocyclic scaffolds in a combinatorial fashion, all at a picomole scale in nanoliter volumes using acoustic droplet ejection technology. In a proof-of-concept, we generate a target-tailored library of 19,968 macrocycles by conjugating 104 carboxylic-acid fragments to 192 macrocyclic scaffolds. The high reaction efficiency and small number of side products of the acylation reactions allowed direct assay without purification and thus a large throughput. In screens, we identify nanomolar inhibitors against thrombin (Ki = 44 ± 1 nM) and the MDM2:p53 protein-protein interaction (Kd MDM2 = 43 ± 18 nM). The increased efficiency of macrocycle synthesis and screening and general applicability of this approach unlocks possibilities for generating leads against any protein target.","Macrocycles have potential as therapeutics, but their libraries are currently not large enough for high-throughput screening. Here, the authors show a combinatorial approach to generate a library of almost 20’000 macrocycles by conjugating carboxylic-acid fragments to macrocyclic scaffolds, identifying nanomolar inhibitors against thrombin and binders of MDM2.",2022-07-02
1642,Olfactory modulation of barrel cortex activity during active whisking and passive whisker stimulation,"Rodents depend on olfaction and touch to meet many of their fundamental needs. However, the impact of simultaneous olfactory and tactile inputs on sensory representations in the cortex remains elusive. To study these interactions, we recorded large populations of barrel cortex neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice during olfactory and tactile stimulation. Here we show that odors bidirectionally alter activity in a small but significant population of barrel cortex neurons through at least two mechanisms, first by enhancing whisking, and second by a central mechanism that persists after whisking is abolished by facial nerve sectioning. Odor responses have little impact on tactile information, and they are sufficient for decoding odor identity, while behavioral parameters like whisking, sniffing, and facial movements are not odor identity-specific. Thus, barrel cortex activity encodes specific olfactory information that is not linked with odor-induced changes in behavior.",Rodents use both touch and smell to get around. This work describes how olfactory information is combined with touch perception in the cortex to guide behavior.,2022-07-02
1643,An in situ hydrogel-mediated chemo-immunometabolic cancer therapy,"Metabolic reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and poor immunogenicity are two of the challenges that cancer immunotherapies have to overcome for improved clinical benefits. Among various immunosuppressive metabolites that keep anti-tumor immunity in check, the tryptophan catabolite kynurenine (Kyn) is an attractive target for blockade given its role in mediating immunosuppression through multiple pathways. Here, we present a local chemo-immunometabolic therapy through injection of a supramolecular hydrogel concurrently releasing doxorubicin that induces immunogenic tumor cell death and kynureninase that disrupts Kyn-mediated immunosuppressive pathways in TME. The combination synergically enhances tumor immunogenicity and unleashes anti-tumor immunity. In mouse models of triple negative breast cancer and melanoma, a single low dose peritumoral injection of the therapeutic hydrogel promotes TME transformation toward more immunostimulatory, which leads to enhanced tumor suppression and extended mouse survival. In addition, the systemic anti-tumor surveillance induced by the local treatment exhibits an abscopal effect and prevents tumor relapse post-resection. This versatile approach for local chemo-immunometabolic therapy may serve as a general strategy for enhancing anti-tumor immunity and boosting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.","Tryptophan metabolism, leading to the accumulation of kynurenine (Kyn) in the tumor microenvironment, restricts anti-tumor immunity. Here the authors report the design of a hydrogel loaded with doxorubicin and Kyn-degrading kynureninase to relieve immunosuppression, showing anti-tumor responses in preclinical models.",2022-07-02
1644,Manipulating polariton condensates by Rashba-Dresselhaus coupling at room temperature,"Spin-orbit coupling plays an important role in the spin Hall effect and topological insulators. Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling show remarkable quantum phase transition. In this work we control an exciton polariton condensate – a macroscopically coherent state of hybrid light and matter excitations – by virtue of the Rashba-Dresselhaus (RD) spin-orbit coupling. This is achieved in a liquid-crystal filled microcavity where CsPbBr3 perovskite microplates act as the gain material at room temperature. Specifically, we realize an artificial gauge field acting on the CsPbBr3 exciton polariton condensate, splitting the condensate fractions with opposite spins in both momentum and real space. Besides the ground states, higher-order discrete polariton modes can also be split by the RD effect. Our work paves the way to manipulate exciton polariton condensates with a synthetic gauge field based on the RD spin-orbit coupling at room temperature.","Engineered spin-orbit coupling can induce novel quantum phases in a Bose-Einstein condensate, however such demonstrations have been limited to cold atom systems.

1645,A litmus test for classifying recognition mechanisms of transiently binding proteins,"Partner recognition in protein binding is critical for all biological functions, and yet, delineating its mechanism is challenging, especially when recognition happens within microseconds. We present a theoretical and experimental framework based on straight-forward nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion measurements to investigate protein binding mechanisms on sub-millisecond timescales, which are beyond the reach of standard rapid-mixing experiments. This framework predicts that conformational selection prevails on ubiquitin’s paradigmatic interaction with an SH3 (Src-homology 3) domain. By contrast, the SH3 domain recognizes ubiquitin in a two-state binding process. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state modeling reveal that the ubiquitin conformation selected for binding exhibits a characteristically extended C-terminus. Our framework is robust and expandable for implementation in other binding scenarios with the potential to show that conformational selection might be the design principle of the hubs in protein interaction networks.",The authors provide a litmus test for the recognition mechanism of transiently binding proteins based on nuclear magnetic resonance and find a conformational selection binding mechanism through concentration-dependent kinetics of ubiquitin and SH3.,2022-07-01
1646,Albedo changes caused by future urbanization contribute to global warming,"The replacement of natural lands with urban structures has multiple environmental consequences, yet little is known about the magnitude and extent of albedo-induced warming contributions from urbanization at the global scale in the past and future. Here, we apply an empirical approach to quantify the climate effects of past urbanization and future urbanization projected under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). We find an albedo-induced warming effect of urbanization for both the past and the projected futures under three illustrative scenarios. The albedo decease from urbanization in 2018 relative to 2001 has yielded a 100-year average annual global warming of 0.00014 [0.00008, 0.00021] °C. Without proper mitigation, future urbanization in 2050 relative to 2018 and that in 2100 relative to 2018 under the intermediate emission scenario (SSP2-4.5) would yield a 100-year average warming effect of 0.00107 [0.00057,0.00179] °C and 0.00152 [0.00078,0.00259] °C, respectively, through altering the Earth’s albedo.",Albedo changes caused by projected future urban land expansion will contribute to global warming without proper mitigation. This warming effect will be larger under higher emission scenarios than under lower emission scenarios.,2022-07-01
1647,Co-optimization of therapeutic antibody affinity and specificity using machine learning models that generalize to novel mutational space,"Therapeutic antibody development requires selection and engineering of molecules with high affinity and other drug-like biophysical properties. Co-optimization of multiple antibody properties remains a difficult and time-consuming process that impedes drug development. Here we evaluate the use of machine learning to simplify antibody co-optimization for a clinical-stage antibody (emibetuzumab) that displays high levels of both on-target (antigen) and off-target (non-specific) binding. We mutate sites in the antibody complementarity-determining regions, sort the antibody libraries for high and low levels of affinity and non-specific binding, and deep sequence the enriched libraries. Interestingly, machine learning models trained on datasets with binary labels enable predictions of continuous metrics that are strongly correlated with antibody affinity and non-specific binding. These models illustrate strong tradeoffs between these two properties, as increases in affinity along the co-optimal (Pareto) frontier require progressive reductions in specificity. Notably, models trained with deep learning features enable prediction of novel antibody mutations that co-optimize affinity and specificity beyond what is possible for the original antibody library. These findings demonstrate the power of machine learning models to greatly expand the exploration of novel antibody sequence space and accelerate the development of highly potent, drug-like antibodies.",Optimising antibody properties such as affinity can be detrimental to other key properties. Here the authors use machine learning to simplify the identification of antibodies with co-optimal levels of affinity and specificity for a clinical-stage antibody that displays high levels of on- and off-target binding.,2022-07-01
1648,Dopamine encodes real-time reward availability and transitions between reward availability states on different timescales,"Optimal behavior requires interpreting environmental cues that indicate when to perform actions. Dopamine is important for learning about reward-predicting events, but its role in adapting to inhibitory cues is unclear. Here we show that when mice can earn rewards in the absence but not presence of an auditory cue, dopamine level in the ventral striatum accurately reflects reward availability in real-time over a sustained period (80 s). In addition, unpredictable transitions between different states of reward availability are accompanied by rapid (~1–2 s) dopamine transients that deflect negatively at the onset and positively at the offset of the cue. This Dopamine encoding of reward availability and transitions between reward availability states is not dependent on reward or activity evoked dopamine release, appears before mice learn the task and is sensitive to motivational state. Our findings are consistent across different techniques including electrochemical recordings and fiber photometry with genetically encoded optical sensors for calcium and dopamine.","Dopamine in the ventral striatum conveys a complex reward-associated signal. This study demonstrates how dopamine reflects sustained reward availability, and rapidly signals unexpected changes in availability.",2022-07-01
1649,Analysis of diverse double-strand break synapsis with Polλ reveals basis for unique substrate specificity in nonhomologous end-joining,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) threaten genomic stability, since their persistence can lead to loss of critical genetic information, chromosomal translocations or rearrangements, and cell death. DSBs can be repaired through the nonhomologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ), which processes and ligates DNA ends efficiently to prevent or minimize sequence loss. Polymerase λ (Polλ), one of the Family X polymerases, fills sequence gaps of DSB substrates with a strict specificity for a base-paired primer terminus. There is little information regarding Polλ’s approach to engaging such substrates. We used in vitro polymerization and cell-based NHEJ assays to explore the contributions of conserved loop regions toward DSB substrate specificity and utilization. In addition, we present multiple crystal structures of Polλ in synapsis with varying biologically relevant DSB end configurations, revealing how key structural features and hydrogen bonding networks work in concert to stabilize these tenuous, potentially cytotoxic DNA lesions during NHEJ.","Using X-ray crystallography and nonhomologous end-joining assays, this study reveals structural features within Polλ that provide it with the ability to bridge and stabilize tenuous DNA double-strand break ends, allowing for religation.",2022-07-01
1650,Mouse pulmonary interstitial macrophages mediate the pro-tumorigenic effects of IL-9,"Although IL-9 has potent anti-tumor activity in adoptive cell transfer therapy, some models suggest that it can promote tumor growth. Here, we show that IL-9 signaling is associated with poor outcomes in patients with various forms of lung cancer, and is required for lung tumor growth in multiple mouse models. CD4+ T cell-derived IL-9 promotes the expansion of both CD11c+ and CD11c− interstitial macrophage populations in lung tumor models. Mechanistically, the IL-9/macrophage axis requires arginase 1 (Arg1) to mediate tumor growth. Indeed, adoptive transfer of Arg1+ but not Arg1- lung macrophages to Il9r−/− mice promotes tumor growth. Moreover, targeting IL-9 signaling using macrophage-specific nanoparticles restricts lung tumor growth in mice. Lastly, elevated expression of IL-9R and Arg1 in tumor lesions is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Thus, our study suggests the IL-9/macrophage/Arg1 axis is a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer therapy.","The role of IL-9 in the tumor microenvironment and its effects on macrophages remains unclear. Here, the authors show that IL-9 promotes the expansion of pulmonary macrophages and that targeting the IL-9R/arginase 1 axis restricts tumor growth, thus identifying this cytokine pathway as a potential therapeutic target.",2022-07-01
1651,DDX1 vesicles control calcium-dependent mitochondrial activity in mouse embryos,"The DEAD box protein DDX1, previously associated with 3’-end RNA processing and DNA repair, forms large aggregates in the cytoplasm of early mouse embryos. Ddx1 knockout causes stalling of embryos at the 2-4 cell stages. Here, we identify a DDX1-containing membrane-bound calcium-containing organelle with a nucleic acid core. We show that aggregates of these organelles form ring-like structures in early-stage embryos which we have named Membrane Associated RNA-containing Vesicles. We present evidence that DDX1 is required for the formation of Membrane Associated RNA-containing Vesicles which in turn regulate the spatial distribution of calcium in embryos. We find that Ddx1 knockout in early embryos disrupts calcium distribution, and increases mitochondria membrane potential, mitochondrial activity, and reactive oxygen species. Sequencing analysis of embryos from Ddx1 heterozygote crosses reveals downregulation of a subset of RNAs involved in developmental and mitochondrial processes in the embryos with low Ddx1 RNA. We propose a role for Membrane Associated RNA-containing Vesicles in calcium-controlled mitochondrial functions that are essential for embryonic development.","The DEAD box protein DDX1 is known to form large aggregates in the cytoplasm of early mouse embryos. Here the authors identify DDX1-containing vesicles and show that loss of Ddx1 affects their integrity, compromising mitochondria function and causing embryonic lethality.",2022-07-01
1652,Many dissimilar NusG protein domains switch between α-helix and β-sheet folds,"Folded proteins are assumed to be built upon fixed scaffolds of secondary structure, α-helices and β-sheets. Experimentally determined structures of >58,000 non-redundant proteins support this assumption, though it has recently been challenged by ~100 fold-switching proteins. Though ostensibly rare, these proteins raise the question of how many uncharacterized proteins have shapeshifting–rather than fixed–secondary structures. Here, we use a comparative sequence-based approach to predict fold switching in the universally conserved NusG transcription factor family, one member of which has a 50-residue regulatory subunit experimentally shown to switch between α-helical and β-sheet folds. Our approach predicts that 24% of sequences in this family undergo similar α-helix ⇌ β-sheet transitions. While these predictions cannot be reproduced by other state-of-the-art computational methods, they are confirmed by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for 10 out of 10 sequence-diverse variants. This work suggests that fold switching may be a pervasive mechanism of transcriptional regulation in all kingdoms of life.","Folded proteins are composed of secondary structures, α-helices and β-sheets, that are generally assumed to be stable. Here, the authors combine computational prediction with experimental validation to show that many sequence-diverse NusG protein domains switch completely from α-helix to β-sheet folds.",2022-07-01
1653,Photochemical Synthesis of Transition Metal-Stabilized Uranium(VI) Nitride Complexes,"Uranium nitrides play important roles in dinitrogen activation and functionalization and in chemistry for nuclear fuels, but the synthesis and isolation of the highly reactive uranium(VI) nitrides remains challenging. Here, we report an example of transition metal (TM) stabilized U(VI) nitride complexes, which are generated by the photolysis of azide-bridged U(IV)-TM (TM = Rh, Ir) precursors. The U(V) nitride intermediates with bridged azide ligands are isolated successfully by careful control of the irradiation time, suggesting that the photolysis of azide-bridged U(IV)-TM precursors is a stepwise process. The presence of two U(VI) nitrides stabilized by three TMs is clearly demonstrated by an X-ray crystallographic study. These TM stabilized U(V) nitride intermediates and U(VI) nitride products exhibit excellent stability both in the solid-state and in THF solution under ambient light. Density functional theory calculations show that the photolysis necessary to break the N-N bond of the azide ligands implies excitation from uranium f-orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), as suggested by the strong antibonding N-(N2) character present in the latter.","The synthesis and isolation of uranium(VI) nitride complexes remains challenging. Here, the authors report an example of transition metal (TM) stabilized U(VI) nitride complexes, generated via photolysis of azide-bridged U(IV)-TM precursors.",2022-07-01
1654,Molecular dissection of the glutamine synthetase-GlnR nitrogen regulatory circuitry in Gram-positive bacteria,"How bacteria sense and respond to nitrogen levels are central questions in microbial physiology. In Gram-positive bacteria, nitrogen homeostasis is controlled by an operon encoding glutamine synthetase (GS), a dodecameric machine that assimilates ammonium into glutamine, and the GlnR repressor. GlnR detects nitrogen excess indirectly by binding glutamine-feedback-inhibited-GS (FBI-GS), which activates its transcription-repression function. The molecular mechanisms behind this regulatory circuitry, however, are unknown. Here we describe biochemical and structural analyses of GS and FBI-GS-GlnR complexes from pathogenic and non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. The structures show FBI-GS binds the GlnR C-terminal domain within its active-site cavity, juxtaposing two GlnR monomers to form a DNA-binding-competent GlnR dimer. The FBI-GS-GlnR interaction stabilizes the inactive GS conformation. Strikingly, this interaction also favors a remarkable dodecamer to tetradecamer transition in some GS, breaking the paradigm that all bacterial GS are dodecamers. These data thus unveil unique structural mechanisms of transcription and enzymatic regulation.","How bacteria sense and respond to nitrogen is a key question in microbial physiology. This work unveils the mechanism by which the central nitrogen metabolic enzyme, glutamine synthetase, directly signals nitrogen availability to the GlnR regulator.",2022-07-01
1655,Separating natural from human enhanced methane emissions in headwater streams,"Headwater streams are natural sources of methane but are suffering severe anthropogenic disturbance, particularly land use change and climate warming. The widespread intensification of agriculture since the 1940s has increased the export of fine sediments from land to streams, but systematic assessment of their effects on stream methane is lacking. Here we show that excess fine sediment delivery is widespread in UK streams (n = 236) and, set against a pre-1940s baseline, has markedly increased streambed organic matter (23 to 100 g m−2), amplified streambed methane production and ultimately tripled methane emissions (0.2 to 0.7 mmol CH4 m−2 d−1, n = 29). While streambed methane production responds strongly to organic matter, we estimate the effect of the approximate 0.7 °C of warming since the 1940s to be comparatively modest. By separating natural from human enhanced methane emissions we highlight how catchment management targeting the delivery of excess fine sediment could mitigate stream methane emissions by some 70%.","The effects of fertiliser from intensive agriculture are well recognised, but not so well for fine-sediment. Here we show how widespread ingress of agriculturally derived fine-sediment since the 1940s markedly amplifies methane emissions from streams.",2022-07-01
1656,Revisiting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy around the world using data from 23 countries in 2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact daily life, including health system operations, despite the availability of vaccines that are effective in greatly reducing the risks of death and severe disease. Misperceptions of COVID-19 vaccine safety, efficacy, risks, and mistrust in institutions responsible for vaccination campaigns have been reported as factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy. This study investigated COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy globally in June 2021. Nationally representative samples of 1,000 individuals from 23 countries were surveyed. Data were analyzed descriptively, and weighted multivariable logistic regressions were used to explore associations with vaccine hesitancy. Here, we show that more than three-fourths (75.2%) of the 23,000 respondents report vaccine acceptance, up from 71.5% one year earlier. Across all countries, vaccine hesitancy is associated with a lack of trust in COVID-19 vaccine safety and science, and skepticism about its efficacy. Vaccine hesitant respondents are also highly resistant to required proof of vaccination; 31.7%, 20%, 15%, and 14.8% approve requiring it for access to international travel, indoor activities, employment, and public schools, respectively. For ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaigns to succeed in improving coverage going forward, substantial challenges remain to be overcome. These include increasing vaccination among those reporting lower vaccine confidence in addition to expanding vaccine access in low- and middle-income countries.","Vaccine hesitancy is a public health challenge. Here the authors examine COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in June 2021 using a survey including individuals from 23 countries, and report differences compared to a year earlier.",2022-07-01
1657,T cell cholesterol efflux suppresses apoptosis and senescence and increases atherosclerosis in middle aged mice,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by hypercholesterolemia. During aging, T cells accumulate cholesterol, potentially affecting inflammation. However, the effect of cholesterol efflux pathways mediated by ATP-binding cassette A1 and G1 (ABCA1/ABCG1) on T cell-dependent age-related inflammation and atherosclerosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we generate mice with T cell-specific Abca1/Abcg1-deficiency on the low-density-lipoprotein-receptor deficient (Ldlr−/−) background. T cell Abca1/Abcg1-deficiency decreases blood, lymph node, and splenic T cells, and increases T cell activation and apoptosis. T cell Abca1/Abcg1-deficiency induces a premature T cell aging phenotype in middle-aged (12–13 months) Ldlr−/− mice, reflected by upregulation of senescence markers. Despite T cell senescence and enhanced T cell activation, T cell Abca1/Abcg1-deficiency decreases atherosclerosis and aortic inflammation in middle-aged Ldlr−/− mice, accompanied by decreased T cells in atherosclerotic plaques. We attribute these effects to T cell apoptosis downstream of T cell activation, compromising T cell functionality. Collectively, we show that T cell cholesterol efflux pathways suppress T cell apoptosis and senescence, and induce atherosclerosis in middle-aged Ldlr−/− mice.","Cholesterol efflux is mediated by specific transporters in T cells. Here the authors show that when the ABCA1/ABCG1 cholesterol transporters are absent, peripheral T cell numbers are reduced but activation increased with a premature aging phenotype of T cell senescence and apoptosis in middle aged Ldlr−/− mice.",2022-07-01
1658,Intestine-enriched apolipoprotein b orthologs are required for stem cell progeny differentiation and regeneration in planarians,"Lipid metabolism plays an instructive role in regulating stem cell state and differentiation. However, the roles of lipid mobilization and utilization in stem cell-driven regeneration are unclear. Planarian flatworms readily restore missing tissue due to injury-induced activation of pluripotent somatic stem cells called neoblasts. Here, we identify two intestine-enriched orthologs of apolipoprotein b, apob-1 and apob-2, which mediate transport of neutral lipid stores from the intestine to target tissues including neoblasts, and are required for tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Inhibition of apob function by RNAi causes head regression and lysis in uninjured animals, and delays body axis re-establishment and regeneration of multiple organs in amputated fragments. Furthermore, apob RNAi causes expansion of the population of differentiating neoblast progeny and dysregulates expression of genes enriched in differentiating and mature cells in eight major cell type lineages. We conclude that intestine-derived lipids serve as a source of metabolites required for neoblast progeny differentiation.","Lipid metabolism regulates stem cell states and differentiation. Here, the authors demonstrate a requirement in planarians for Apolipoprotein B-mediated neutral lipid transport from intestinal stores to stem cells and their progeny during differentiation and whole-body regeneration.",2022-07-01
1659,Biomarkers of nanomaterials hazard from multi-layer data,"There is an urgent need to apply effective, data-driven approaches to reliably predict engineered nanomaterial (ENM) toxicity. Here we introduce a predictive computational framework based on the molecular and phenotypic effects of a large panel of ENMs across multiple in vitro and in vivo models. Our methodology allows for the grouping of ENMs based on multi-omics approaches combined with robust toxicity tests. Importantly, we identify mRNA-based toxicity markers and extensively replicate them in multiple independent datasets. We find that models based on combinations of omics-derived features and material intrinsic properties display significantly improved predictive accuracy as compared to physicochemical properties alone.","Nanomaterials have a range of potential applications, however, toxicity remains a concern, limiting application and requiring extensive testing. Here, the authors report on a predictive framework made using a range of tests linking materials properties with toxicity, allowing the prediction of toxicity from physiochemical and biological properties.",2022-07-01
1660,Traps and transport resistance are the next frontiers for stable non-fullerene acceptor solar cells,"Stability is one of the most important challenges facing material research for organic solar cells (OSC) on their path to further commercialization. In the high-performance material system PM6:Y6 studied here, we investigate degradation mechanisms of inverted photovoltaic devices. We have identified two distinct degradation pathways: one requires the presence of both illumination and oxygen and features a short-circuit current reduction, the other one is induced thermally and marked by severe losses of open-circuit voltage and fill factor. We focus our investigation on the thermally accelerated degradation. Our findings show that bulk material properties and interfaces remain remarkably stable, however, aging-induced defect state formation in the active layer remains the primary cause of thermal degradation. The increased trap density leads to higher non-radiative recombination, which limits the open-circuit voltage and lowers the charge carrier mobility in the photoactive layer. Furthermore, we find the trap-induced transport resistance to be the major reason for the drop in fill factor. Our results suggest that device lifetimes could be significantly increased by marginally suppressing trap formation, leading to a bright future for OSC.","Long operational stability is essential to commercialisation of organic solar cells. Here, the authors investigate the thermal degradation of inverted photovoltaic devices based on PM6:Y6 non-fullerene system to reveal that trap-induced transport resistance is primarily responsible for the drop in fill factor.",2022-07-01
1661,Global stocks and capacity of mineral-associated soil organic carbon,"Soil is the largest terrestrial reservoir of organic carbon and is central for climate change mitigation and carbon-climate feedbacks. Chemical and physical associations of soil carbon with minerals play a critical role in carbon storage, but the amount and global capacity for storage in this form remain unquantified. Here, we produce spatially-resolved global estimates of mineral-associated organic carbon stocks and carbon-storage capacity by analyzing 1144 globally-distributed soil profiles. We show that current stocks total 899 Pg C to a depth of 1 m in non-permafrost mineral soils. Although this constitutes 66% and 70% of soil carbon in surface and deeper layers, respectively, it is only 42% and 21% of the mineralogical capacity. Regions under agricultural management and deeper soil layers show the largest undersaturation of mineral-associated carbon. Critically, the degree of undersaturation indicates sequestration efficiency over years to decades. We show that, across 103 carbon-accrual measurements spanning management interventions globally, soils furthest from their mineralogical capacity are more effective at accruing carbon; sequestration rates average 3-times higher in soils at one tenth of their capacity compared to soils at one half of their capacity. Our findings provide insights into the world’s soils, their capacity to store carbon, and priority regions and actions for soil carbon management.","Mineral-organic associations play a key role in soil carbon preservation. Here, Georgiou et al. produce global estimates of mineral-associated soil carbon, providing insight into the world’s soils and their capacity to store carbon",2022-07-01
1662,RuO2 electronic structure and lattice strain dual engineering for enhanced acidic oxygen evolution reaction performance,"Developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction remains a great challenge due to the sluggish kinetics of the four-electron transfer reaction and severe catalyst dissolution. Here we report an electrochemical lithium intercalation method to improve both the activity and stability of RuO2 for acidic oxygen evolution reaction. The lithium intercalates into the lattice interstices of RuO2, donates electrons and distorts the local structure. Therefore, the Ru valence state is lowered with formation of stable Li-O-Ru local structure, and the Ru–O covalency is weakened, which suppresses the dissolution of Ru, resulting in greatly enhanced durability. Meanwhile, the inherent lattice strain results in the surface structural distortion of LixRuO2 and activates the dangling O atom near the Ru active site as a proton acceptor, which stabilizes the OOH* and dramatically enhances the activity. This work provides an effective strategy to develop highly efficient catalyst towards water splitting.","While water splitting in acid offers higher operational performances than in alkaline conditions, there are few high-activity, acid-stable oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Here, authors examine electrochemical Li intercalation to improve the activity and stability of RuO2 for acidic water oxidation.",2022-07-01
1663,Rapid Eocene diversification of spiny plants in subtropical woodlands of central Tibet,"Spinescence is an important functional trait possessed by many plant species for physical defence against mammalian herbivores. The development of spinescence must have been closely associated with both biotic and abiotic factors in the geological past, but knowledge of spinescence evolution suffers from a dearth of fossil records, with most studies focusing on spatial patterns and spinescence-herbivore interactions in modern ecosystems. Numerous well-preserved Eocene (~39 Ma) plant fossils exhibiting seven different spine morphologies discovered recently in the central Tibetan Plateau, combined with molecular phylogenetic character reconstruction, point not only to the presence of a diversity of spiny plants in Eocene central Tibet but a rapid diversification of spiny plants in Eurasia around that time. These spiny plants occupied an open woodland landscape, indicated by numerous megafossils and grass phytoliths found in the same deposits, as well as numerical climate and vegetation modelling. Our study shows that regional aridification and expansion of herbivorous mammals may have driven the diversification of functional spinescence in central Tibetan woodlands, ~24 million years earlier than similar transformations in Africa.","Spines are an important physical defense for many plant species. Here, the authors describe seven different spine morphologies from the Eocene of central Tibet associated with regional aridification and expansion of herbivorous mammals.",2022-07-01
1664,A comprehensive resource for Bordetella genomic epidemiology and biodiversity studies,"The genus Bordetella includes bacteria that are found in the environment and/or associated with humans and other animals. A few closely related species, including Bordetella pertussis, are human pathogens that cause diseases such as whooping cough. Here, we present a large database of Bordetella isolates and genomes and develop genotyping systems for the genus and for the B. pertussis clade. To generate the database, we merge previously existing databases from Oxford University and Institut Pasteur, import genomes from public repositories, and add 83 newly sequenced B. bronchiseptica genomes. The public database currently includes 2582 Bordetella isolates and their provenance data, and 2085 genomes (https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/bordetella/). We use core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) to develop genotyping systems for the whole genus and for B. pertussis, as well as specific schemes to define antigenic, virulence and macrolide resistance profiles. Phylogenetic analyses allow us to redefine evolutionary relationships among known Bordetella species, and to propose potential new species. Our database provides an expandable resource for genotyping of environmental and clinical Bordetella isolates, thus facilitating evolutionary and epidemiological research on whooping cough and other Bordetella infections.","The genus Bordetella includes environmental bacteria as well as human pathogens.

1665,A natural uORF variant confers phosphorus acquisition diversity in soybean,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for all organisms. Because P fertilizers are a non-renewable resource and high fixation in soils, sustainable agriculture requires researchers to improve crop P acquisition efficiency. Here, we report a strong association signal at a locus of CPU1 (component of phosphorus uptake 1), from a genome-wide association study of P acquisition efficiency in a soybean core collection grown in the field. A SEC12-like gene, GmPHF1, is identified as the causal gene for CPU1. GmPHF1 facilitates the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) exit of the phosphate transporter, GmPT4, to the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells. A common SNP in an upstream open reading frame (uORF) of GmPHF1, which alters the abundance of GmPHF1 in a tissue-specific manner, contributes to P acquisition diversity in soybean. A natural genetic variation conditions diversity in soybean P acquisition, which can be used to develop P-efficient soybean genotypes.","Improving phosphorus (P) acquisition efficiency is important for sustainable agriculture. Here, the authors report a natural variation in an upstream open reading frame of a SEC12-like gene GmPHF1 is crucial for protein abundance and spatial distribution of GmPHF1, which contribute to P acquisition diversity in soybean.",2022-07-01
1666,"Association of mitochondrial DNA content, heteroplasmies and inter-generational transmission with autism","Mitochondria are essential for brain development. While previous studies linked dysfunctional mitochondria with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the role of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) in ASD risk is largely unexplored. This study investigates the association of mtDNA heteroplasmies (co-existence of mutated and unmutated mtDNA) and content with ASD, as well as its inter-generational transmission and sex differences among two independent samples: a family-based study (n = 1,938 families with parents, probands and sibling controls) and a prospective birth cohort (n = 997 mother-child pairs). In both samples, predicted pathogenic (PP) heteroplasmies in children are associated with ASD risk (Meta-OR = 1.56, P = 0.00068). Inter-generational transmission of mtDNA reveals attenuated effects of purifying selection on maternal heteroplasmies in children with ASD relative to controls, particularly among males. Among children with ASD and PP heteroplasmies, increased mtDNA content shows benefits for cognition, communication, and behaviors (P ≤ 0.02). These results underscore the value of exploring maternal and newborn mtDNA in ASD.","Most genetic studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have focused on the nuclear genome. Here, the authors show that variations in mitochondrial DNA, detectable at birth, are also associated with risk of ASD.",2022-07-01
1667,Homogeneous surrogate virus neutralization assay to rapidly assess neutralization activity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,"The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the development of numerous diagnostic tools to monitor infection and to determine immune response. Although assays to measure binding antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are widely available, more specific tests measuring neutralization activities of antibodies are immediately needed to quantify the extent and duration of protection that results from infection or vaccination. We previously developed a ‘Serological Assay based on a Tri-part split-NanoLuc® (SATiN)’ to detect antibodies that bind to the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we expand on our previous work and describe a reconfigured version of the SATiN assay, called Neutralization SATiN (Neu-SATiN), which measures neutralization activity of antibodies directly from convalescent or vaccinated sera. The results obtained with our assay and other neutralization assays are comparable but with significantly shorter preparation and run time for Neu-SATiN. As the assay is modular, we further demonstrate that Neu-SATiN enables rapid assessment of the effectiveness of vaccines and level of protection against existing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and can therefore be readily adapted for emerging variants.","Neutralisation assays are key to understanding immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. Here, the authors report a surrogate virus neutralization assay called Neu-SATiN, which measures neutralization directly from sera, and allows easy adaptation to variant-specific testing.",2022-07-01
1668,Development of visual response selectivity in cortical GABAergic interneurons,"The visual cortex of carnivores and primates displays a high degree of modular network organization characterized by local clustering and structured long-range correlations of activity and functional properties. Excitatory networks display modular organization before the onset of sensory experience, but the developmental timeline for modular networks of GABAergic interneurons remains under-explored. Using in vivo calcium imaging of the ferret visual cortex, we find evidence that before visual experience, interneurons display weak orientation tuning and widespread, correlated activity in response to visual stimuli. Robust modular organization and orientation tuning are evident with as little as one week of visual experience. Furthermore, we find that the maturation of orientation tuning requires visual experience, while the reduction in widespread, correlated network activity does not. Thus, the maturation of inhibitory cortical networks occurs in a delayed, parallel process relative to excitatory neurons.","Excitatory neurons in the carnivore and primate visual cortex display orientation selectivity arranged in a modular fashion before the onset of visual experience, but the developmental timeline for visual response selectivity of inhibitory neurons is unknown. Using in vivo calcium imaging in ferret visual cortex, the authors show that experience-dependent emergence of orientation selectivity develops in a modular fashion for inhibitory interneurons over the first week of visual experience.",2022-07-01
1669,Nanoparticle suspensions from carbon-rich fluid make high-grade gold deposits,"Economic gold deposits result from a 100- to 10,000-fold enrichment in gold relative to crustal background. In hydrothermal systems, this enrichment is achieved through the transport and accumulation of metals via deeply sourced fluids to a site of deposition. However, the generally low metal solubility of Au in aqueous solutions in orogenic systems requires additional processes in order to explain high-grade gold formation. Reports of Au nanoparticles in high-grade gold veins infer that their formation is linked to mineralisation. However, processes leading to nanoparticle nucleation and deposition remain poorly understood. Here we show that formation of metal nanoparticles (Au, AuAg, Cu, Ag2O) is one of the essential contributors to efficient and focused gold deposition. We report systematic and previously unrecognized metal nanoparticles preserved in amorphous silica and/or carbonic phases in five high-grade deposits. The association of metal, silica and carbonic phases helps to constrain the multiple reactive processes involved in Au, Cu and Ag metallogenesis and formation of high-grade gold mineralisation.",The authors present novel observations providing insights into the formation of extraordinary gold-rich veins.

1670,Transcription factor paralogs orchestrate alternative gene regulatory networks by context-dependent cooperation with multiple cofactors,"In eukaryotes, members of transcription factor families often exhibit similar DNA binding properties in vitro, yet orchestrate paralog-specific gene regulatory networks in vivo. The serially homologous first (T1) and third (T3) thoracic legs of Drosophila, which are specified by the Hox proteins Scr and Ubx, respectively, offer a unique opportunity to address this paradox in vivo. Genome-wide analyses using epitope-tagged alleles of both Hox loci in the T1 and T3 leg imaginal discs, the precursors to the adult legs and ventral body regions, show that ~8% of Hox binding is paralog-specific. Binding specificity is mediated by interactions with distinct cofactors in different domains: the Hox cofactor Exd acts in the proximal domain and is necessary for Scr to bind many of its paralog-specific targets, while in the distal leg domain, the homeodomain protein Distal-less (Dll) enhances Scr binding to a different subset of loci. These findings reveal how Hox paralogs, and perhaps paralogs of other transcription factor families, orchestrate alternative downstream gene regulatory networks with the help of multiple, context-specific cofactors.","Feng et al. compare the genome-wide binding and activity of two Drosophila Hox transcription factors that determine the identities of different fly legs. For binding events that are Hox specific, two cofactors, Exd and Dll, are used to achieve specificity in non-overlapping leg domains.",2022-07-01
1671,Solvent-driven fractional crystallization for atom-efficient separation of metal salts from permanent magnet leachates,"This work reports a dimethyl ether-driven fractional crystallization process for separating rare earth elements and transition metals. The process has been successfully applied in the treatment of rare earth element-bearing permanent magnet leachates as an atom-efficient, reagent-free separation method. Using ~5 bar pressure, the solvent was dissolved into the aqueous system to displace the contained metal salts as solid precipitates. Treatments at distinct temperatures ranging from 20–31 °C enable crystallization of either lanthanide-rich or transition metal-rich products, with single-stage solute recovery of up to 95.9% and a separation factor as high as 704. Separation factors increase with solution purity, suggesting feasibility for eco-friendly solution treatments in series and parallel to purify aqueous material streams. Staged treatments are demonstrated as capable of further improving the separation factor and purity of crystallized products. Upon completion of a crystallization, the solvent can be recovered with high efficiency at ambient pressure. This separation process involves low energy and reagent requirements and does not contribute to waste generation.","Rare earth elements are essential to electrified infrastructure and clean energy production. Here, authors show reagent- and energy-efficient separation of lanthanides from secondary feedstock using dimethyl ether-driven fractional crystallization.",2022-07-01
1672,Microbiota mediated plasticity promotes thermal adaptation in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis,"At the current rate of climate change, it is unlikely that multicellular organisms will be able to adapt to changing environmental conditions through genetic recombination and natural selection alone. Thus, it is critical to understand alternative mechanisms that allow organisms to cope with rapid environmental changes. Here, we use the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, which has evolved the capability of surviving in a wide range of temperatures and salinities, as a model to investigate the microbiota as a source of rapid adaptation. We long-term acclimate polyps of Nematostella to low, medium, and high temperatures, to test the impact of microbiota-mediated plasticity on animal acclimation. Using the same animal clonal line, propagated from a single polyp, allows us to eliminate the effects of the host genotype. The higher thermal tolerance of animals acclimated to high temperature can be transferred to non-acclimated animals through microbiota transplantation. The offspring fitness is highest from F0 females acclimated to high temperature and specific members of the acclimated microbiota are transmitted to the next generation. These results indicate that microbiota plasticity can contribute to animal thermal acclimation and its transmission to the next generation may represent a rapid mechanism for thermal adaptation.",This study shows that sea anemones acclimated to high temperatures exhibit increased resistance to thermal stress and that this improved fitness can be transferred by microbiome transplantation. These results indicate that plasticity mediated by the microbiota might be an important factor facilitating thermal adaptations in animals.,2022-07-01
1673,Facile and general electrochemical deuteration of unactivated alkyl halides,"Herein, a facile and general electroreductive deuteration of unactivated alkyl halides (X = Cl, Br, I) or pseudo-halides (X = OMs) using D2O as the economical deuterium source was reported. In addition to primary and secondary alkyl halides, sterically hindered tertiary chlorides also work very well, affording the target deuterodehalogenated products with excellent efficiency and deuterium incorporation. More than 60 examples are provided, including late-stage dehalogenative deuteration of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and their derivatives, all with excellent deuterium incorporation (up to 99% D), demonstrating the potential utility of the developed method in organic synthesis. Furthermore, the method does not require external catalysts and tolerates high current, showing possible use in industrial applications.","Deuterium-labelled compounds are useful for mechanistic studies and pharmaceutical science, but syntheses are not trivial. Here, the authors report deuteration of unactivated alkyl (pseudo)halides driven by electrochemical force, using deuterium oxide as the source of the isotope.",2022-06-30
1674,Optimised weight programming for analogue memory-based deep neural networks,"Analogue memory-based deep neural networks provide energy-efficiency and per-area throughput gains relative to state-of-the-art digital counterparts such as graphics processing units. Recent advances focus largely on hardware-aware algorithmic training and improvements to circuits, architectures, and memory devices. Optimal translation of software-trained weights into analogue hardware weights—given the plethora of complex memory non-idealities—represents an equally important task. We report a generalised computational framework that automates the crafting of complex weight programming strategies to minimise accuracy degradations during inference, particularly over time. The framework is agnostic to network structure and generalises well across recurrent, convolutional, and transformer neural networks. As a highly flexible numerical heuristic, the approach accommodates arbitrary device-level complexity, making it potentially relevant for a variety of analogue memories. By quantifying the limit of achievable inference accuracy, it also enables analogue memory-based deep neural network accelerators to reach their full inference potential.","Device-level complexity represents a big shortcoming for the hardware realization of analogue memory-based deep neural networks. Mackin et al. report a generalized computational framework, translating software-trained weights into analogue hardware weights, to minimise inference accuracy degradation.",2022-06-30
1675,86Kr excess and other noble gases identify a billion-year-old radiogenically-enriched groundwater system,"Deep within the Precambrian basement rocks of the Earth, groundwaters can sustain subsurface microbial communities, and are targets of investigation both for geologic storage of carbon and/or nuclear waste, and for new reservoirs of rapidly depleting resources of helium. Noble gas-derived residence times have revealed deep hydrological settings where groundwaters are preserved on millions to billion-year timescales. Here we report groundwaters enriched in the highest concentrations of radiogenic products yet discovered in fluids, with an associated 86Kr excess in the free fluid, and residence times >1 billion years. This brine, from a South African gold mine 3 km below surface, demonstrates that ancient groundwaters preserved in the deep continental crust on billion-year geologic timescales may be more widespread than previously understood. The findings have implications beyond Earth, where on rocky planets such as Mars, subsurface water may persist on long timescales despite surface conditions that no longer provide a habitable zone.",Noble gases confirm billion-year groundwater residence times and external fluxes in deep crustal settings globally with implications for subsurface habitability and economic reservoir formation over planetary timescales both on Earth and beyond,2022-06-30
1676,"An essential role for tungsten in the ecology and evolution of a previously uncultivated lineage of anaerobic, thermophilic Archaea","Trace metals have been an important ingredient for life throughout Earth’s history. Here, we describe the genome-guided cultivation of a member of the elusive archaeal lineage Caldarchaeales (syn. Aigarchaeota), Wolframiiraptor gerlachensis, and its growth dependence on tungsten. A metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) of W. gerlachensis encodes putative tungsten membrane transport systems, as well as pathways for anaerobic oxidation of sugars probably mediated by tungsten-dependent ferredoxin oxidoreductases that are expressed during growth. Catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in-situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) show that W. gerlachensis preferentially assimilates xylose. Phylogenetic analyses of 78 high-quality Wolframiiraptoraceae MAGs from terrestrial and marine hydrothermal systems suggest that tungsten-associated enzymes were present in the last common ancestor of extant Wolframiiraptoraceae. Our observations imply a crucial role for tungsten-dependent metabolism in the origin and evolution of this lineage, and hint at a relic metabolic dependence on this trace metal in early anaerobic thermophiles.","Trace metals have been an important ingredient for life throughout Earth’s history. Here, the authors show that a member of an elusive archaeal lineage (Caldarchaeales or Aigarchaeota) requires tungsten for growth, and provide evidence that tungsten-dependent metabolism played a role in the origin and evolution of this lineage.",2022-06-30
1677,Endowing universal CAR T-cell with immune-evasive properties using TALEN-gene editing,"Universal CAR T-cell therapies are poised to revolutionize cancer treatment and to improve patient outcomes. However, realizing these advantages in an allogeneic setting requires universal CAR T-cells that can kill target tumor cells, avoid depletion by the host immune system, and proliferate without attacking host tissues. Here, we describe the development of a novel immune-evasive universal CAR T-cells scaffold using precise TALEN-mediated gene editing and DNA matrices vectorized by recombinant adeno-associated virus 6. We simultaneously disrupt and repurpose the endogenous TRAC and B2M loci to generate TCRαβ- and HLA-ABC-deficient T-cells expressing the CAR construct and the NK-inhibitor named HLA-E. This highly efficient gene editing process enables the engineered T-cells to evade NK cell and alloresponsive T-cell attacks and extend their persistence and antitumor activity in the presence of cytotoxic levels of NK cell in vivo and in vitro, respectively. This scaffold could enable the broad use of universal CAR T-cells in allogeneic settings and holds great promise for clinical applications.","Host versus graft reaction is a major impediment to CAR-T cell immune therapy in allogeneic settings. Authors show here that CAR-T cells, engineered to be deficient in MHC I expression but to express the NK inhibitor HLA-E, are resistant to destruction by both T and NK cells of the host.",2022-06-30
1678,"Inherited basis of visceral, abdominal subcutaneous and gluteofemoral fat depots","For any given level of overall adiposity, individuals vary considerably in fat distribution. The inherited basis of fat distribution in the general population is not fully understood. Here, we study up to 38,965 UK Biobank participants with MRI-derived visceral (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous (ASAT), and gluteofemoral (GFAT) adipose tissue volumes. Because these fat depot volumes are highly correlated with BMI, we additionally study six local adiposity traits: VAT adjusted for BMI and height (VATadj), ASATadj, GFATadj, VAT/ASAT, VAT/GFAT, and ASAT/GFAT. We identify 250 independent common variants (39 newly-identified) associated with at least one trait, with many associations more pronounced in female participants. Rare variant association studies extend prior evidence for PDE3B as an important modulator of fat distribution. Local adiposity traits (1) highlight depot-specific genetic architecture and (2) enable construction of depot-specific polygenic scores that have divergent associations with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. These results – using MRI-derived, BMI-independent measures of local adiposity – confirm fat distribution as a highly heritable trait with important implications for cardiometabolic health outcomes.","The inherited basis of body fat distribution is not fully understood. Here, the authors use genetic data and MRI-derived measures of local adiposity to highlight fat depot-specific genetic architecture with implications for cardiometabolic health.",2022-06-30
1679,Comparative genomics of Acinetobacter baumannii and therapeutic bacteriophages from a patient undergoing phage therapy,"In 2016, a 68-year-old patient with a disseminated multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection was successfully treated using lytic bacteriophages. Here we report the genomes of the nine phages used for treatment and three strains of A. baumannii isolated prior to and during treatment. The phages used in the initial treatment are related, T4-like myophages. Analysis of 19 A. baumannii isolates collected before and during phage treatment shows that resistance to the T4-like phages appeared two days following the start of treatment. We generate complete genomic sequences for three A. baumannii strains (TP1, TP2 and TP3) collected before and during treatment, supporting a clonal relationship. Furthermore, we use strain TP1 to select for increased resistance to five of the phages in vitro, and identify mutations that are also found in phage-insensitive isolates TP2 and TP3 (which evolved in vivo during phage treatment). These results support that in vitro investigations can produce results that are relevant to the in vivo environment.","A patient with a multidrug-resistant bacterial infection was successfully treated in 2016 using phage therapy. Here, the authors sequence the genomes of the therapeutic phages and three bacterial strains isolated before and during treatment, and show that the same mutations conferring phage resistance are found in in vitro-generated mutants and in phage-insensitive strains isolated from the patient.",2022-06-30
1680,Tight junction channel regulation by interclaudin interference,"Tight junctions form selectively permeable seals across the paracellular space. Both barrier function and selective permeability have been attributed to members of the claudin protein family, which can be categorized as pore-forming or barrier-forming. Here, we show that claudin-4, a prototypic barrier-forming claudin, reduces paracellular permeability by a previously unrecognized mechanism. Claudin-4 knockout or overexpression has minimal effects on tight junction permeability in the absence of pore-forming claudins. However, claudin-4 selectively inhibits flux across cation channels formed by claudins 2 or 15. Claudin-4-induced loss of claudin channel function is accompanied by reduced anchoring and subsequent endocytosis of pore-forming claudins. Analyses in nonepithelial cells show that claudin-4, which is incapable of independent polymerization, disrupts polymeric strands and higher order meshworks formed by claudins 2, 7, 15, and 19. This process of interclaudin interference, in which one claudin disrupts higher order structures and channels formed by a different claudin, represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of barrier regulation.","Tight junctions are formed by claudin proteins that can be classified as pore- or barrier-forming. Here, Shashikanth et al. report a third function, termed interclaudin interference, in which one claudin inhibits pore function of another claudin by disrupting its polymeric complexes.",2022-06-30
1681,Simple synthesis of massively parallel RNA microarrays via enzymatic conversion from DNA microarrays,"RNA catalytic and binding interactions with proteins and small molecules are fundamental elements of cellular life processes as well as the basis for RNA therapeutics and molecular engineering. In the absence of quantitative predictive capacity for such bioaffinity interactions, high throughput experimental approaches are needed to sufficiently sample RNA sequence space. Here we report on a simple and highly accessible approach to convert commercially available customized DNA microarrays of any complexity and density to RNA microarrays via a T7 RNA polymerase-mediated extension of photocrosslinked methyl RNA primers and subsequent degradation of the DNA templates.","RNA microarrays have many potential applications, but are difficult to produce. Here, the AUs present a method for converting commercial, customizable DNA microarrays into RNA microarrays using an accessible three-step process involving primer photocrosslinking, extension, and template degradation.",2022-06-30
1682,A deep Tasman outflow of Pacific waters during the last glacial period,"The interoceanic exchange of water masses is modulated by flow through key oceanic choke points in the Drake Passage, the Indonesian Seas, south of Africa, and south of Tasmania. Here, we use the neodymium isotope signature (εNd) of cold-water coral skeletons from intermediate depths (1460‒1689 m) to trace circulation changes south of Tasmania during the last glacial period. The key feature of our dataset is a long-term trend towards radiogenic εNd values of ~−4.6 during the Last Glacial Maximum and Heinrich Stadial 1, which are clearly distinct from contemporaneous Southern Ocean εNd of ~−7. When combined with previously published radiocarbon data from the same corals, our results indicate that a unique radiogenic and young water mass was present during this time. This scenario can be explained by a more vigorous Pacific overturning circulation that supported a deeper outflow of Pacific waters, including North Pacific Intermediate Water, through the Tasman Sea.","Using cold-water corals, this work identifies a deep outflow of Pacific waters via the Tasman Sea during the last ice age, thus highlighting the role of this area for the interoceanic exchange of water masses on climatic time scales.",2022-06-30
1683,Voltage-driven gigahertz frequency tuning of spin Hall nano-oscillators,"Spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) exploiting current-driven magnetization auto-oscillation have recently received much attention because of their potential for neuromorphic computing. Widespread applications of neuromorphic devices with SHNOs require an energy-efficient method of tuning oscillation frequency over broad ranges and storing trained frequencies in SHNOs without the need for additional memory circuitry. While the voltage-driven frequency tuning of SHNOs has been demonstrated, it was volatile and limited to megahertz ranges. Here, we show that the frequency of SHNOs is controlled up to 2.1 GHz by an electric field of 1.25 MV/cm. The large frequency tuning is attributed to the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) in a perpendicularly magnetized Ta/Pt/[Co/Ni]n/Co/AlOx structure. Moreover, the non-volatile VCMA effect enables cumulative control of the frequency using repetitive voltage pulses which mimic the potentiation and depression functions of biological synapses. Our results suggest that the voltage-driven frequency tuning of SHNOs facilitates the development of energy-efficient neuromorphic devices.","Spin-hall nano-oscillators are a variation on spin-torque nano-oscillators, where the spin-Hall effect is used to drive oscillations, however past examples have had limited frequency tunability. Here, Choi et al demonstrate spin-hall oscillators with wide voltage controlled frequency tunability.",2022-06-30
1684,Promoting biomass electrooxidation via modulating proton and oxygen anion deintercalation in hydroxide,"The redox center of transition metal oxides and hydroxides is generally considered to be the metal site. Interestingly, proton and oxygen in the lattice recently are found to be actively involved in the catalytic reactions, and critically determine the reactivity. Herein, taking glycerol electrooxidation reaction as the model reaction, we reveal systematically the impact of proton and oxygen anion (de)intercalation processes on the elementary steps. Combining density functional theory calculations and advanced spectroscopy techniques, we find that doping Co into Ni-hydroxide promotes the deintercalation of proton and oxygen anion from the catalyst surface. The oxygen vacancies formed in NiCo hydroxide during glycerol electrooxidation reaction increase d-band filling on Co sites, facilitating the charge transfer from catalyst surface to cleaved molecules during the 2nd C-C bond cleavage. Consequently, NiCo hydroxide exhibits enhanced glycerol electrooxidation activity, with a current density of 100 mA/cm2 at 1.35 V and a formate selectivity of 94.3%.","Developing catalysts for biomass electrooxidation are critical in electric refinery. The reaction mechanism, however, is still ambiguous. Here, the authors reveal how proton and oxygen anion deintercalation in hydroxide determine the elementary reaction steps in a model reaction of glycerol oxidation.",2022-06-30
1685,On-chip bacterial foraging training in silicon photonic circuits for projection-enabled nonlinear classification,"On-chip training remains a challenging issue for photonic devices to implement machine learning algorithms. Most demonstrations only implement inference in photonics for offline-trained neural network models. On the other hand, artificial neural networks are one of the most deployed algorithms, while other machine learning algorithms such as supporting vector machine (SVM) remain unexplored in photonics. Here, inspired by SVM, we propose to implement projection-based classification principle by constructing nonlinear mapping functions in silicon photonic circuits and experimentally demonstrate on-chip bacterial foraging training for this principle to realize single Boolean logics, combinational Boolean logics, and Iris classification with ~96.7 − 98.3 per cent accuracy. This approach can offer comparable performances to artificial neural networks for various benchmarks even with smaller scales and without leveraging traditional activation functions, showing scalability advantage. Natural-intelligence-inspired bacterial foraging offers efficient and robust on-chip training, and this work paves a way for photonic circuits to perform nonlinear classification.","On-chip training of machine learning algorithms is challenging for photonic devices. Here, the authors construct nonlinear mapping functions in silicon photonic circuits, and experimentally demonstrate on-chip bacterial foraging training for projection-based classification.",2022-06-30
1686,Primitive noble gases sampled from ocean island basalts cannot be from the Earth’s core,"Noble gas isotopes in plumes require a source of primitive volatiles largely isolated in the Earth for 4.5 Gyrs. Among the proposed reservoirs, the core is gaining interest in the absence of robust geochemical and geophysical evidence for a mantle source. This is supported by partitioning data showing that sufficient He and Ne could have been incorporated into the core to source plumes today. Here we perform ab initio calculations on the partitioning of He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe between liquid iron and silicate melt under core forming conditions. For He our results are consistent with previous studies allowing for substantial amounts of He in the core. In contrast, the partition coefficient for Ne is three orders of magnitude lower than He. This very low partition coefficient would result in a 3He/22Ne ratio of ~103 in the core, far higher than observed in ocean island basalts (OIBs). We conclude that the core is not the source of noble gases in OIBs.","Li et al. established a liquid-liquid partition model based on ab initio calculations to reveal that He and Ne strongly fractionate during core-mantle separation, which concludes the primitive volatiles seen in hotspots cannot be from the core.",2022-06-30
1687,Allosteric inhibition of PPM1D serine/threonine phosphatase via an altered conformational state,"PPM1D encodes a serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates numerous pathways including the DNA damage response and p53. Activating mutations and amplification of PPM1D are found across numerous cancer types. GSK2830371 is a potent and selective allosteric inhibitor of PPM1D, but its mechanism of binding and inhibition of catalytic activity are unknown. Here we use computational, biochemical and functional genetic studies to elucidate the molecular basis of GSK2830371 activity. These data confirm that GSK2830371 binds an allosteric site of PPM1D with high affinity. By further incorporating data from hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation, we demonstrate that PPM1D exists in an equilibrium between two conformations that are defined by the movement of the flap domain, which is required for substrate recognition. A hinge region was identified that is critical for switching between the two conformations and was directly implicated in the high-affinity binding of GSK2830371 to PPM1D. We propose that the two conformations represent active and inactive forms of the protein reflected by the position of the flap, and that binding of GSK2830371 shifts the equilibrium to the inactive form. Finally, we found that C-terminal truncating mutations proximal to residue 400 result in destabilization of the protein via loss of a stabilizing N- and C-terminal interaction, consistent with the observation from human genetic data that nearly all PPM1D mutations in cancer are truncating and occur distal to residue 400. Taken together, our findings elucidate the mechanism by which binding of a small molecule to an allosteric site of PPM1D inhibits its activity and provides insights into the biology of PPM1D.","In this work, the authors report a sophisticated combination of genetic, biophysical, and biochemical analyses to identifies the cycling conformational states of PPM1D. The findings reveal how an allosteric inhibitor locks the protein into a conformationally inactive state, and explain the distribution of PPM1D activating mutations in cancer.",2022-06-30
1688,Trans-cellular tunnels induced by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans facilitate invasion through successive epithelial cells without host damage,"The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is normally commensal, residing in the mucosa of most healthy individuals. In susceptible hosts, its filamentous hyphal form can invade epithelial layers leading to superficial or severe systemic infection. Although invasion is mainly intracellular, it causes no apparent damage to host cells at early stages of infection. Here, we investigate C. albicans invasion in vitro using live-cell imaging and the damage-sensitive reporter galectin-3. Quantitative single cell analysis shows that invasion can result in host membrane breaching at different stages and host cell death, or in traversal of host cells without membrane breaching. Membrane labelling and three-dimensional ‘volume’ electron microscopy reveal that hyphae can traverse several host cells within trans-cellular tunnels that are progressively remodelled and may undergo ‘inflations’ linked to host glycogen stores. Thus, C. albicans early invasion of epithelial tissues can lead to either host membrane breaching or trans-cellular tunnelling.","The fungal pathogen Candida albicans forms filamentous hyphae that can invade the epithelium. Here, Lachat et al. show that C. albicans early invasion of epithelial tissues can lead to either host membrane breaching and host cell death, or trans-cellular tunnelling through host cells without membrane breaching.",2022-06-30
1689,Associations between long-term drought and diarrhea among children under five in low- and middle-income countries,"Climate change is projected to intensify drought conditions, which may increase the risk of diarrheal diseases in children. We constructed log-binomial generalized linear mixed models to examine the association between diarrhea risk, ascertained from global-scale nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys, and drought, represented by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, among children under five in 51 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Exposure to 6-month mild or severe drought was associated with an increased diarrhea risk of 5% (95% confidence interval 3–7%) or 8% (5–11%), respectively. The association was stronger among children living in a household that needed longer time to collect water or had no access to water or soap/detergent for handwashing. The association for 24-month drought was strong in dry zones but weak or null in tropical or temperate zones, whereas that for 6-month drought was only observed in tropical or temperate zones. In this work we quantify the associations between exposure to long-term drought and elevated diarrhea risk among children under five in LMICs and suggest that the risk could be reduced through improved water, sanitation, and hygiene practices, made more urgent by the likely increase in drought due to climate change.","Increased droughts are associated with climate change. Here, the authors reveal an association between long-term drought and an elevated risk of diarrhea in children under five in low- and middle income countries, and suggest that improving water quality, sanitation, and hygiene practices might reduce the risk.",2022-06-30
1690,Effect of vaccination on household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant of concern,"Effective vaccines protect individuals by not only reducing the susceptibility to infection, but also reducing the infectiousness of breakthrough infections in vaccinated cases. To disentangle the vaccine effectiveness against susceptibility to infection (VES) and vaccine effectiveness against infectiousness (VEI), we took advantage of Danish national data comprising 24,693 households with a primary case of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Delta Variant of Concern, 2021) including 53,584 household contacts. In this setting, we estimated VES as 61% (95%-CI: 59-63), when the primary case was unvaccinated, and VEI as 31% (95%-CI: 26-36), when the household contact was unvaccinated. Furthermore, unvaccinated secondary cases with an infection exhibited a three-fold higher viral load compared to fully vaccinated secondary cases with a breakthrough infection. Our results demonstrate that vaccinations reduce susceptibility to infection as well as infectiousness, which should be considered by policy makers when seeking to understand the public health impact of vaccination against transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","COVID-19 vaccines may reduce the susceptibility of an individual to infection and/or the infectiousness of breakthrough infections. Here, the authors use data from Denmark and estimate that vaccine effectiveness was 61% for susceptibility and 31% for infectiousness during a period of Delta variant dominance.",2022-06-30
1691,Reconstruction of a catalogue of genome-scale metabolic models with enzymatic constraints using GECKO 2.0,"Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) have been widely used for quantitative exploration of the relation between genotype and phenotype. Streamlined integration of enzyme constraints and proteomics data into such models was first enabled by the GECKO toolbox, allowing the study of phenotypes constrained by protein limitations. Here, we upgrade the toolbox in order to enhance models with enzyme and proteomics constraints for any organism with a compatible GEM reconstruction. With this, enzyme-constrained models for the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yarrowia lipolytica and Kluyveromyces marxianus are generated to study their long-term adaptation to several stress factors by incorporation of proteomics data. Predictions reveal that upregulation and high saturation of enzymes in amino acid metabolism are common across organisms and conditions, suggesting the relevance of metabolic robustness in contrast to optimal protein utilization as a cellular objective for microbial growth under stress and nutrient-limited conditions. The functionality of GECKO is expanded with an automated framework for continuous and version-controlled update of enzyme-constrained GEMs, also producing such models for Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens. In this work, we facilitate the utilization of enzyme-constrained GEMs in basic science, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology purposes.","Genome-scale metabolic models have been widely used for quantitative exploration of the relation between genotype and phenotype.

1692,Ion-cluster-mediated ultrafast self-healable ionoconductors for reconfigurable electronics,"Implementing self-healing capabilities in a deformable platform is one of the critical challenges for achieving future wearable electronics with high durability and reliability. Conventional systems are mostly based on polymeric materials, so their self-healing usually proceeds at elevated temperatures to promote chain flexibility and reduce healing time. Here, we propose an ion-cluster-driven self-healable ionoconductor composed of rationally designed copolymers and ionic liquids. After complete cleavage, the ionoconductor can be repaired with high efficiency (∼90.3%) within 1 min even at 25 °C, which is mainly attributed to the dynamic formation of ion clusters between the charged moieties in copolymers and ionic liquids. By taking advantages of the superior self-healing performance, stretchability (∼1130%), non-volatility (over 6 months), and ability to be easily shaped as desired through cutting and re-assembly protocol, reconfigurable, deformable light-emitting electroluminescent displays are successfully demonstrated as promising electronic platforms for future applications.","Implementing high-performance self-healing capability is one urgent challenge for deformable electronics.

1693,Rhythmic interactions between the mediodorsal thalamus and prefrontal cortex precede human visual perception,"The thalamus is much more than a simple sensory relay. High-order thalamic nuclei, such as the mediodorsal thalamus, exert a profound influence over animal cognition. However, given the difficulty of directly recording from the thalamus in humans, next-to-nothing is known about thalamic and thalamocortical contributions to human cognition. To address this, we analysed simultaneously-recorded thalamic iEEG and whole-head MEG in six patients (plus MEG recordings from twelve healthy controls) as they completed a visual detection task. We observed that the phase of both ongoing mediodorsal thalamic and prefrontal low-frequency activity was predictive of perceptual performance. Critically however, mediodorsal thalamic activity mediated prefrontal contributions to perceptual performance. These results suggest that it is thalamocortical interactions, rather than cortical activity alone, that is predictive of upcoming perceptual performance and, more generally, highlights the importance of accounting for the thalamus when theorising about cortical contributions to human cognition.","How the thalamus and the cortex interact in the context of perception remains largely unclear. Here, the authors show that rhythmic activity in the human mediodorsal thalamus and prefrontal cortex interact to predict whether a near-threshold visual stimulus will be seen, contradicting the traditional view that the thalamus is a simple relay.",2022-06-29
1694,The genetic architecture of pneumonia susceptibility implicates mucin biology and a relationship with psychiatric illness,"Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. In this study, we use genome-wide meta-analysis of lifetime pneumonia diagnosis (N = 391,044) to identify four association signals outside of the previously implicated major histocompatibility complex region. Integrative analyses and finemapping of these signals support clinically tractable targets, including the mucin MUC5AC and tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member TNFRSF1A. Moreover, we demonstrate widespread evidence of genetic overlap with pneumonia susceptibility across the human phenome, including particularly significant correlations with psychiatric phenotypes that remain significant after testing differing phenotype definitions for pneumonia or genetically conditioning on smoking behaviour. Finally, we show how polygenic risk could be utilised for precision treatment formulation or drug repurposing through pneumonia risk scores constructed using variants mapped to pathways with known drug targets. In summary, we provide insights into the genetic architecture of pneumonia susceptibility and genetics informed targets for drug development or repositioning.","Susceptibility to pneumonia has a genetic component, but specific genes involved remain poorly understood.

1695,Pervasive translation of circular RNAs driven by short IRES-like elements,"Some circular RNAs (circRNAs) were found to be translated through IRES-driven mechanism, however the scope and functions of circRNA translation are unclear because endogenous IRESs are rare. To determine the prevalence and mechanism of circRNA translation, we develop a cell-based system to screen random sequences and identify 97 overrepresented hexamers that drive cap-independent circRNA translation. These IRES-like short elements are significantly enriched in endogenous circRNAs and sufficient to drive circRNA translation. We further identify multiple trans-acting factors that bind these IRES-like elements to initiate translation. Using mass-spectrometry data, hundreds of circRNA-coded peptides are identified, most of which have low abundance due to rapid degradation. As judged by mass-spectrometry, 50% of translatable endogenous circRNAs undergo rolling circle translation, several of which are experimentally validated. Consistently, mutations of the IRES-like element in one circRNA reduce its translation. Collectively, our findings suggest a pervasive translation of circRNAs, providing profound implications in translation control.","Unbiased screen of random sequences identified many short IRES-like elements to drive circular RNA translation and hundreds of rolling circle translation events, suggesting a pervasive cap-independent translation in human transcriptome.",2022-06-29
1696,Unraveling the molecular mechanism of MIL-53(Al) crystallization,"The vast structural and chemical diversity of metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) provides the exciting possibility of material’s design with tailored properties for gas separation, storage and catalysis. However, after more than twenty years after first reports introducing MOFs, the discovery and control of their synthesis remains extremely challenging due to the lack of understanding of mechanisms of their nucleation and growth. Progress in deciphering crystallization pathways depends on the possibility to follow conversion of initial reagents to products at the molecular level, which is a particular challenge under solvothermal conditions. The present work introduces a detailed molecular-level mechanism of the formation of MIL-53(Al), unraveled by combining in situ time-resolved high-resolution mass-spectrometry, magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. In contrast to the general belief, the crystallization of MIL-53 occurs via a solid-solid transformation mechanism, associated with the spontaneous release of monomeric aluminum. The role of DMF hydrolysis products, formate and dimethylamine, is established. Our study emphasizes the complexity of MOF crystallization chemistry, which requires case-by-case investigation using a combination of advanced in situ methods for following the induction period, the nucleation and growth across the time domain.","The discovery and control of the synthesis of metal–organic frameworks remains challenging due to the lack of understanding of their nucleation and growth. Here, the authors report a detailed molecular-level mechanism of the formation of MIL-53(Al).",2022-06-29
1697,Limited effects of m6A modification on mRNA partitioning into stress granules,"The presence of the m6A modification in mammalian mRNAs is proposed to promote mRNA recruitment to stress granules through the interaction with YTHDF proteins. We test this possibility by examining the accumulation of mRNAs in stress granules in both WT and ∆METTL3 mES cells, which are deficient in m6A modification. A critical observation is that all m6A modified mRNAs partition similarly into stress granules in both wild-type and m6A-deficient cells by single-molecule FISH. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis indicates m6A modification explains only 6% of the variance in stress granule localization when controlled for length. Finally, the artificial tethering of 25 YTHDF proteins on reporter mRNAs leads to only a modest increase in mRNA partitioning to stress granules. Since most mammalian mRNAs have 4 or fewer m6A sites, and those sites are not fully modified, this argues m6A modifications are unlikely to play a significant role in recruiting mRNAs to stress granules. Taken together, these observations argue that m6A modifications play a minimal, if any, role in mRNA partitioning into stress granules.","Recent studies proposed that m6A modification in mammalian mRNAs increases their recruitment to stress granule. However, here the authors observed that m6A modification has a limited effect on mRNA entry into stress granules.",2022-06-29
1698,Regulation of age-associated insulin resistance by MT1-MMP-mediated cleavage of insulin receptor,"Insulin sensitivity progressively declines with age. Currently, the mechanism underlying age-associated insulin resistance remains unknown. Here, we identify membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MT1-MMP/MMP14) as a central regulator of insulin sensitivity during ageing. Ageing promotes MMP14 activation in insulin-sensitive tissues, which cleaves Insulin Receptor to suppress insulin signaling. MT1-MMP inhibition restores Insulin Receptor expression, improving insulin sensitivity in aged mice. The cleavage of Insulin Receptor by MT1-MMP also contributes to obesity-induced insulin resistance and inhibition of MT1-MMP activities normalizes metabolic dysfunctions in diabetic mouse models. Conversely, overexpression of MT1-MMP in the liver reduces the level of Insulin Receptor, impairing hepatic insulin sensitivity in young mice. The soluble Insulin Receptor and circulating MT1-MMP are positively correlated in plasma from aged human subjects and non-human primates. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into regulation of insulin sensitivity during physiological ageing and highlight MT1-MMP as a promising target for therapeutic avenue against diabetes.","Insulin sensitivity declines with age via unclear mechanisms. Here, the authors show that the activity of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is increased with ageing, leading to cleavage of the insulin receptor, and show that metabolic effects can be rescued by MT1-MMP inhibition in mice.",2022-06-29
1699,Host lung microbiota promotes malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome,"Severe malaria can manifest itself with a variety of well-recognized clinical phenotypes that are highly predictive of death – severe anaemia, coma (cerebral malaria), multiple organ failure, and respiratory distress. The reasons why an infected individual develops one pathology rather than another remain poorly understood. Here we use distinct rodent models of infection to show that the host microbiota is a contributing factor for the development of respiratory distress syndrome and host mortality in the context of malaria infections (malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome, MA-ARDS). We show that parasite sequestration in the lung results in sustained immune activation. Subsequent production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by T cells compromises microbial control, leading to severe lung disease. Notably, bacterial clearance with linezolid, an antibiotic commonly used in the clinical setting to control lung-associated bacterial infections, prevents MA-ARDS-associated lethality. Thus, we propose that the host’s anti-inflammatory response to limit tissue damage can result in loss of microbial control, which promotes MA-ARDS. This must be considered when intervening against life-threatening respiratory complications.","The reasons why malaria manifests with a variety of well-recognized clinical phenotypes remain poorly understood. Here, using distinct rodent models, the authors reveal that the microbiota colonizing the lung promotes respiratory distress syndrome and mortality during malaria infections.",2022-06-29
1700,CD8+T cell responsiveness to anti-PD-1 is epigenetically regulated by Suv39h1 in melanomas,"Tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells progressively lose functionality and fail to reject tumors. The underlying mechanism and re-programing induced by checkpoint blockers are incompletely understood. We show here that genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of histone lysine methyltransferase Suv39h1 delays tumor growth and potentiates tumor rejection by anti-PD-1. In the absence of Suv39h1, anti-PD-1 induces alternative activation pathways allowing survival and differentiation of IFNγ and Granzyme B producing effector cells that express negative checkpoint molecules, but do not reach final exhaustion. Their transcriptional program correlates with that of melanoma patients responding to immune-checkpoint blockade and identifies the emergence of cytolytic-effector tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as a biomarker of clinical response. Anti-PD-1 favors chromatin opening in loci linked to T-cell activation, memory and pluripotency, but in the absence of Suv39h1, cells acquire accessibility in cytolytic effector loci. Overall, Suv39h1 inhibition enhances anti-tumor immune responses, alone or combined with anti-PD-1, suggesting that Suv39h1 is an “epigenetic checkpoint” for tumor immunity.",Understanding CD8 + T cell response to immune checkpoint blockade at the molecular level is important for the design of more efficient cancer immune therapies. Authors show here that the histone lysine methyltransferase Suv39h1 controls the transcriptional programs that determine the functionality of CD8 + T cells and Suv39h1 inhibition may potentiate anti-PD-1 therapy of melanomas.,2022-06-29
1701,SARS-CoV-2 antibody trajectories after a single COVID-19 vaccination with and without prior infection,"Given high SARS-CoV-2 incidence, coupled with slow and inequitable vaccine roll-out in many settings, there is a need for evidence to underpin optimum vaccine deployment, aiming to maximise global population immunity. We evaluate whether a single vaccination in individuals who have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 generates similar initial and subsequent antibody responses to two vaccinations in those without prior infection. We compared anti-spike IgG antibody responses after a single vaccination with ChAdOx1, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the COVID-19 Infection Survey in the UK general population. In 100,849 adults median (50 (IQR: 37–63) years) receiving at least one vaccination, 13,404 (13.3%) had serological/PCR evidence of prior infection. Prior infection significantly boosted antibody responses, producing higher peak levels and/or longer half-lives after one dose of all three vaccines than those without prior infection receiving one or two vaccinations. In those with prior infection, the median time above the positivity threshold was >1 year after the first vaccination. Single-dose vaccination targeted to those previously infected may provide at least as good protection to two-dose vaccination among those without previous infection.","The impact of prior infection on the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination has not been fully characterised. Here, the authors use data from ~100,000 adults in the UK and find that a single vaccine dose in those with prior infection produces a comparable or stronger response to two doses in those without infection.",2022-06-29
1702,Two-band optical gain and ultrabright electroluminescence from colloidal quantum dots at 1000 A cm−2,"Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are attractive materials for the realization of solution-processable laser diodes. Primary challenges towards this objective are fast optical-gain relaxation due to nonradiative Auger recombination and poor stability of colloidal QD solids under high current densities required to obtain optical gain. Here we resolve these challenges and achieve broad-band optical gain spanning the band-edge (1S) and the higher-energy (1P) transitions. This demonstration is enabled by continuously graded QDs with strongly suppressed Auger recombination and a current-focusing device design, combined with short-pulse pumping. Using this approach, we achieve ultra-high current densities (~1000 A cm−2) and brightness (~10 million cd m−2), and demonstrate an unusual two-band electroluminescence regime for which the 1P band is more intense than the 1S feature. This implies the realization of extremely large QD occupancies of up to ~8 excitons per-dot, which corresponds to complete filling of the 1S and 1P electron shells.","Nonradiative Auger recombination and poor stability of colloidal-quantum-dot solids at high current densities are primary obstacles to the realization of laser diodes based on these materials. Jung et al. achieve the current densities in excess of 1,000 A cm−2, which allows them to boost brightness to ~10 million cd m−2 and to produce strong, two-band optical gain.",2022-06-29
1703,Heat-fueled enzymatic cascade for selective oxyfunctionalization of hydrocarbons,"Heat is a fundamental feedstock, where more than 80% of global energy comes from fossil-based heating process. However, it is mostly wasted due to a lack of proper techniques of utilizing the low-quality waste heat (<100 °C). Here we report thermoelectrobiocatalytic chemical conversion systems for heat-fueled, enzyme-catalyzed oxyfunctionalization reactions. Thermoelectric bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) directly converts low-temperature waste heat into chemical energy in the form of H2O2 near room temperature. The streamlined reaction scheme (e.g., water, heat, enzyme, and thermoelectric material) promotes enantio- and chemo-selective hydroxylation and epoxidation of representative substrates (e.g., ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, tetralin, cyclohexane, cis-β-methylstyrene), achieving a maximum total turnover number of rAaeUPO (TTNrAaeUPO) over 32000. Direct conversion of vehicle exhaust heat into the enantiopure enzymatic product with a rate of 231.4 μM h−1 during urban driving envisions the practical feasibility of thermoelectrobiocatalysis.","Thermoelectric materials enable us to convert heat into electricity, but their application has been limited to high-temperature heat sources.

1704,WASp modulates RPA function on single-stranded DNA in response to replication stress and DNA damage,"Perturbation in the replication-stress response (RSR) and DNA-damage response (DDR) causes genomic instability. Genomic instability occurs in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), a primary immunodeficiency disorder, yet the mechanism remains largely uncharacterized. Replication protein A (RPA), a single-strand DNA (ssDNA) binding protein, has key roles in the RSR and DDR. Here we show that human WAS-protein (WASp) modulates RPA functions at perturbed replication forks (RFs). Following genotoxic insult, WASp accumulates at RFs, associates with RPA, and promotes RPA:ssDNA complexation. WASp deficiency in human lymphocytes destabilizes RPA:ssDNA-complexes, impairs accumulation of RPA, ATR, ETAA1, and TOPBP1 at genotoxin-perturbed RFs, decreases CHK1 activation, and provokes global RF dysfunction. las17 (yeast WAS-homolog)-deficient S. cerevisiae also show decreased ScRPA accumulation at perturbed RFs, impaired DNA recombination, and increased frequency of DNA double-strand break (DSB)-induced single-strand annealing (SSA). Consequently, WASp (or Las17)-deficient cells show increased frequency of DSBs upon genotoxic insult. Our study reveals an evolutionarily conserved, essential role of WASp in the DNA stress-resolution pathway, such that WASp deficiency provokes RPA dysfunction-coupled genomic instability.",Cancer develops in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Here the authors identify a role for WAS-protein (WASp) in the DNA stress-resolution pathway by promoting the function of Replication Protein A at replication forks after DNA damage.,2022-06-29
1705,Inactivation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway promotes melanoma,"Melanoma is commonly driven by activating mutations in the MAP kinase BRAF; however, oncogenic BRAF alone is insufficient to promote melanomagenesis. Instead, its expression induces a transient proliferative burst that ultimately ceases with the development of benign nevi comprised of growth-arrested melanocytes. The tumor suppressive mechanisms that restrain nevus melanocyte proliferation remain poorly understood. Here we utilize cell and murine models to demonstrate that oncogenic BRAF leads to activation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, both in melanocytes in vitro and nevus melanocytes in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that oncogenic BRAF promotes both ERK-dependent alterations in the actin cytoskeleton and whole-genome doubling events, which independently reduce RhoA activity to promote Hippo activation. We also demonstrate that functional impairment of the Hippo pathway enables oncogenic BRAF-expressing melanocytes to bypass nevus formation and rapidly form melanomas. Our data reveal that the Hippo pathway enforces the stable arrest of nevus melanocytes and represents a critical barrier to melanoma development.",Activating mutations of BRAF alone are inadequate to drive melanoma formation. Here the authors show that activation of Hippo signalling by oncogenic BRAF represents an additional safeguard to limit BRAF-dependent human melanocyte growth and melanoma formation.,2022-06-29
1706,Passive mode-locking and terahertz frequency comb generation in resonant-tunneling-diode oscillator,"Optical frequency combs in the terahertz frequency range are long-awaited frequency standards for spectroscopy of molecules and high-speed wireless communications. However, a terahertz frequency comb based on a low-cost, energy-efficient, and room-temperature-operating device remains unavailable especially in the frequency range of 0.1 to 3 THz. In this paper, we show that the resonant-tunneling-diode (RTD) oscillator can be passively mode-locked by optical feedback and generate a terahertz frequency comb. The standard deviation of the spacing between the comb lines, i.e., the repetition frequency, is reduced to less than 420 mHz by applying external bias modulation. A simulation model successfully reproduces the mode-locking behavior by including the nonlinear capacitance of RTD and multiple optical feedback. Since the mode-locked RTD oscillator is a simple semiconductor device that operates at room temperature and covers the frequency range of 0.1 to 2 THz (potentially up to 3 THz), it can be used as a frequency standard for future terahertz sensing and wireless communications.","The authors report passive mode-locking and frequency-comb generation induced by optical feedback in the resonant-tunneling-diode terahertz oscillator, a semiconductor-based oscillator covering the frequency range of 0.1 to 2 THz.",2022-06-29
1707,Vertex protein PduN tunes encapsulated pathway performance by dictating bacterial metabolosome morphology,"Engineering subcellular organization in microbes shows great promise in addressing bottlenecks in metabolic engineering efforts; however, rules guiding selection of an organization strategy or platform are lacking. Here, we study compartment morphology as a factor in mediating encapsulated pathway performance. Using the 1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartment (Pdu MCP) system from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2, we find that we can shift the morphology of this protein nanoreactor from polyhedral to tubular by removing vertex protein PduN. Analysis of the metabolic function between these Pdu microtubes (MTs) shows that they provide a diffusional barrier capable of shielding the cytosol from a toxic pathway intermediate, similar to native MCPs. However, kinetic modeling suggests that the different surface area to volume ratios of MCP and MT structures alters encapsulated pathway performance. Finally, we report a microscopy-based assay that permits rapid assessment of Pdu MT formation to enable future engineering efforts on these structures.","Morphology of metabolosomes affects the encapsulated pathway performance. Here, the authors combine experimental characterizations with structural and kinetic modeling to reveal how the shell protein PduN changes the morphology of 1,2-propanediol utilization (Pdu) metabolosome and how this morphology shift impacts Pdu function.",2022-06-29
1708,Intracontinental deformation of the Tianshan Orogen in response to India-Asia collision,"How the continental lithosphere deforms far away from plate boundaries has been long debated. The Tianshan is a type-example of ongoing lithospheric deformation in an intracontinental setting. It formed during the Paleozoic accretion of the Altaids and was rejuvenated in the Cenozoic, which might be a far-field response to the India-Asia collision. Here we present seismic images of the lithosphere across the central Tianshan, which were constructed from receiver functions and Rayleigh wave dispersions along a N–S-trending linear seismic array. We observe an extensively deformed lithosphere in the Tianshan with inherited, structurally controlled brittle deformation in the shallow crust and plastic deformation near the Moho. We find that earlier multiple accretionary structures were preserved in the crust, which was deformed by pure-shear shortening in the south and thick-skinned tectonics in the north but was limitedly underthrusted by surrounding blocks. A balanced cross-section of Moho discontinuities supports the concept that intracontinental deformation in the Tianshan intensified synchronously with the direct contact between the underthrusting Indian slab and the Tarim Craton in the Late Miocene (~10 Ma). These findings provide a robust and unified seismic model for the Tianshan Orogen, and confirm that effective delivery of the India-Asia collision stress induced the rejuvenation of this intracontinental orogen.","This study presents seismic images across the central Tianshan. The results show that Tianshan’s crust was extensively deformed according to its inherited properties, but was limitedly underthrusted by surrounding blocks",2022-06-29
1709,Structural and electrophysiological basis for the modulation of KCNQ1 channel currents by ML277,"The KCNQ1 ion channel plays critical physiological roles in electrical excitability and K+ recycling in organs including the heart, brain, and gut. Loss of function is relatively common and can cause sudden arrhythmic death, sudden infant death, epilepsy and deafness. Here, we report cryogenic electron microscopic (cryo-EM) structures of Xenopus KCNQ1 bound to Ca2+/Calmodulin, with and without the KCNQ1 channel activator, ML277. A single binding site for ML277 was identified, localized to a pocket lined by the S4-S5 linker, S5 and S6 helices of two separate subunits. Several pocket residues are not conserved in other KCNQ isoforms, explaining specificity. MD simulations and point mutations support this binding location for ML277 in open and closed channels and reveal that prevention of inactivation is an important component of the activator effect. Our work provides direction for therapeutic intervention targeting KCNQ1 loss of function pathologies including long QT interval syndrome and seizures.","KCNQ1 channels are active in heart, brain and gut. Functional loss causes epilepsy and sudden arrhythmic death.

1710,Boosting electrocatalytic CO2–to–ethanol production via asymmetric C–C coupling,"Electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into multicarbon products provides possibility of large-scale chemicals production and is therefore of significant research and commercial interest. However, the production efficiency for ethanol (EtOH), a significant chemical feedstock, is impractically low because of limited selectivity, especially under high current operation. Here we report a new silver–modified copper–oxide catalyst (dCu2O/Ag2.3%) that exhibits a significant Faradaic efficiency of 40.8% and energy efficiency of 22.3% for boosted EtOH production. Importantly, it achieves CO2–to–ethanol conversion under high current operation with partial current density of 326.4 mA cm−2 at −0.87 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode to rank highly significantly amongst reported Cu–based catalysts. Based on in situ spectra studies we show that significantly boosted production results from tailored introduction of Ag to optimize the coordinated number and oxide state of surface Cu sites, in which the *CO adsorption is steered as both atop and bridge configuration to trigger asymmetric C–C coupling for stablization of EtOH intermediates.",It is of high interest to convert CO2 into valuable ethanol product.

1711,A guided multiverse study of neuroimaging analyses,"For most neuroimaging questions the range of possible analytic choices makes it unclear how to evaluate conclusions from any single analytic method. One possible way to address this issue is to evaluate all possible analyses using a multiverse approach, however, this can be computationally challenging and sequential analyses on the same data can compromise predictive power. Here, we establish how active learning on a low-dimensional space capturing the inter-relationships between pipelines can efficiently approximate the full spectrum of analyses. This approach balances the benefits of a multiverse analysis without incurring the cost on computational and predictive power. We illustrate this approach with two functional MRI datasets (predicting brain age and autism diagnosis) demonstrating how a multiverse of analyses can be efficiently navigated and mapped out using active learning. Furthermore, our presented approach not only identifies the subset of analysis techniques that are best able to predict age or classify individuals with autism spectrum disorder and healthy controls, but it also allows the relationships between analyses to be quantified.","Most neuroimaging studies are associated with a broad range analytic and methodological choices that the researcher needs to make, but every choice might lead to different answers, and evaluating all possible analytic choices is computationally challenging. Here, authors present a framework that maps the space of analysis by creating a low-dimensional space and using a Bayesian optimization to navigate it.",2022-06-29
1712,TPGS-based and S-thanatin functionalized nanorods for overcoming drug resistance in Klebsiella pneumonia,"Tigecycline is regarded as the last line of defense to combat multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, increasing utilization has led to rising drug resistance and treatment failure. Here, we design a D-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate-modified and S-thanatin peptide-functionalized nanorods based on calcium phosphate nanoparticles for tigecycline delivery and pneumonia therapy caused by tigecycline-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. After incubation with bacteria, the fabricated nanorods can enhance tigecycline accumulation in bacteria via the inhibitory effect on efflux pumps exerted by D-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate and the targeting capacity of S-thanatin to bacteria. The synergistic antibacterial capacity between S-thanatin and tigecycline further enhances the antibacterial activity of nanorods, thus overcoming the tigecycline resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. After intravenous injection, nanorods significantly reduces the counts of white blood cells and neutrophils, decreases bacterial colonies, and ameliorates neutrophil infiltration events, thereby largely increasing the survival rate of mice with pneumonia. These findings may provide a therapeutic strategy for infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria.","Overproduction of efflux pumps represents an important mechanism of Klebsiella pneumonia resistance to tigecycline.

We develop a deep learning model called HTNet for diagnosis of HT by training on 106,513 thyroid ultrasound images from 17,934 patients and test its performance on 5051 patients from 2 datasets of static images and 1 dataset of video data. HTNet achieves an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.905 (95% CI: 0.894 to 0.915), 0.888 (0.836–0.939) and 0.895 (0.862–0.927). HTNet exceeds radiologists’ performance on accuracy (83.2% versus 79.8%; binomial test, p < 0.001) and sensitivity (82.6% versus 68.1%; p < 0.001). By integrating serologic markers with imaging data, the performance of HTNet was significantly and marginally improved on the video (AUC, 0.949 versus 0.888; DeLong’s test, p = 0.004) and static-image (AUC, 0.914 versus 0.901; p = 0.08) testing sets, respectively.

1714,Distinct nociception processing in the dysgranular and barrel regions of the mouse somatosensory cortex,"Nociception, a somatic discriminative aspect of pain, is, like touch, represented in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), but the separation and interaction of the two modalities within S1 remain unclear. Here, we show spatially distinct tactile and nociceptive processing in the granular barrel field (BF) and adjacent dysgranular region (Dys) in mouse S1. Simultaneous recordings of the multiunit activity across subregions revealed that Dys neurons are more responsive to noxious input, whereas BF neurons prefer tactile input. At the single neuron level, nociceptive information is represented separately from the tactile information in Dys layer 2/3. In contrast, both modalities seem to converge on individual layer 5 neurons of each region, but to a different extent. Overall, these findings show layer-specific processing of nociceptive and tactile information between Dys and BF. We further demonstrated that Dys activity, but not BF activity, is critically involved in pain-like behavior. These findings provide new insights into the role of pain processing in S1.","The processing of nociception in the somatosensory cortex (S1) has yet to be fully understood. Here, the authors demonstrate that the dysgranular region in S1 has an affinity for nociception and is critically involved in pain-like behavior.",2022-06-29
1715,BIGDML—Towards accurate quantum machine learning force fields for materials,"Machine-learning force fields (MLFF) should be accurate, computationally and data efficient, and applicable to molecules, materials, and interfaces thereof. Currently, MLFFs often introduce tradeoffs that restrict their practical applicability to small subsets of chemical space or require exhaustive datasets for training. Here, we introduce the Bravais-Inspired Gradient-Domain Machine Learning (BIGDML) approach and demonstrate its ability to construct reliable force fields using a training set with just 10–200 geometries for materials including pristine and defect-containing 2D and 3D semiconductors and metals, as well as chemisorbed and physisorbed atomic and molecular adsorbates on surfaces. The BIGDML model employs the full relevant symmetry group for a given material, does not assume artificial atom types or localization of atomic interactions and exhibits high data efficiency and state-of-the-art energy accuracies (errors substantially below 1 meV per atom) for an extended set of materials. Extensive path-integral molecular dynamics carried out with BIGDML models demonstrate the counterintuitive localization of benzene–graphene dynamics induced by nuclear quantum effects and their strong contributions to the hydrogen diffusion coefficient in a Pd crystal for a wide range of temperatures.",Most machine-learning force fields dismiss long-range interactions.

1716,The genetic heterogeneity and drug resistance mechanisms of relapsed refractory multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy. Despite significant advances in treatment, relapse is common and carries a poor prognosis. Thus, it is critical to elucidate the genetic factors contributing to disease progression and drug resistance. Here, we carry out integrative clinical sequencing of 511 relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients to define the disease’s molecular alterations landscape. The NF-κB and RAS/MAPK pathways are more commonly altered than previously reported, with a prevalence of 45–65% each. In the RAS/MAPK pathway, there is a long tail of variants associated with the RASopathies. By comparing our RRMM cases with untreated patients, we identify a diverse set of alterations conferring resistance to three main classes of targeted therapy in 22% of our cohort. Activating mutations in IL6ST are also enriched in RRMM. Taken together, our study serves as a resource for future investigations of RRMM biology and potentially informs clinical management.","The genetic factors involved in disease progression and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM) are varied and complex.

1717,In-situ study of the impact of temperature and architecture on the interfacial structure of microgels,"The structural characterization of microgels at interfaces is fundamental to understand both their 2D phase behavior and their role as stabilizers that enable emulsions to be broken on demand. However, this characterization is usually limited by available experimental techniques, which do not allow a direct investigation at interfaces. To overcome this difficulty, here we employ neutron reflectometry, which allows us to probe the structure and responsiveness of the microgels in-situ at the air-water interface. We investigate two types of microgels with different cross-link density, thus having different softness and deformability, both below and above their volume phase transition temperature, by combining experiments with computer simulations of in silico synthesized microgels. We find that temperature only affects the portion of microgels in water, while the strongest effect of the microgels softness is observed in their ability to protrude into the air. In particular, standard microgels have an apparent contact angle of few degrees, while ultra-low cross-linked microgels form a flat polymeric layer with zero contact angle. Altogether, this study provides an in-depth microscopic description of how different microgel architectures affect their arrangements at interfaces, and will be the foundation for a better understanding of their phase behavior and assembly.","The structural characterization of microgels at interfaces is fundamental for the understanding of their 2D phase behavior but characterization is usually limited by available experimental techniques and does not allow a direct investigation at interfaces.

1718,Investigating water/oil interfaces with opto-thermophoresis,"Charging of interfaces between water and hydrophobic media is a mysterious feature whose nature and origin have been under debate. Here, we investigate the fundamentals of the interfacial behaviors of water by employing opto-thermophoretic tweezers to study temperature-gradient-induced perturbation of dipole arrangement at water/oil interfaces. With surfactant-free perfluoropentane-in-water emulsions as a model interface, additional polar organic solvents are introduced to systematically modify the structural aspects of the interface. Through our experimental measurements on the thermophoretic behaviors of oil droplets under a light-generated temperature gradient, in combination with theoretical analysis, we propose that water molecules and mobile negative charges are present at the water/oil interfaces with specific dipole arrangement to hydrate oil droplets, and that this arrangement is highly susceptible to the thermal perturbation due to the mobility of the negative charges. These findings suggest a potential of opto-thermophoresis in probing aqueous interfaces and could enrich understanding of the interfacial behaviors of water.","Charging of interfaces between water and hydrophobic media is a mysterious feature whose nature and origin remain under debate. Here, the authors use opto-thermophoretic tweezers to investigate the interfacial behavior at water/oil interfaces in terms of thermal perturbation of dipole arrangement.",2022-06-29
1719,"Diverse mantle components with invariant oxygen isotopes in the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption, Iceland","The basalts of the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption were the first erupted on the Reykjanes Peninsula in 781 years and offer a unique opportunity to determine the composition of the mantle underlying Iceland, in particular its oxygen isotope composition (δ18O values). The basalts show compositional variations in Zr/Y, Nb/Zr and Nb/Y values that span roughly half of the previously described range for Icelandic basaltic magmas and signal involvement of Icelandic plume (OIB) and Enriched Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt (EMORB) in magma genesis. Here we show that Fagradalsfjall δ18O values are invariable (mean δ18O = 5.4 ± 0.3‰ 2 SD, N = 47) and indistinguishable from “normal” upper mantle, in contrast to significantly lower δ18O values reported for erupted materials elsewhere in Iceland (e.g., the 2014–2015 eruption at Holuhraun, Central Iceland). Thus, despite differing trace element characteristics, the melts that supplied the Fagradalsfjall eruption show no evidence for 18O-depleted mantle or interaction with low-δ18O crust and may therefore represent a useful mantle reference value in this part of the Icelandic plume system.","The 2021 eruption in the Reykjanes Peninsula of Iceland was the first in 800 years and was supplied by melts from diverse mantle source domains with near-identical oxygen isotope ratios, providing a unique insight into the Icelandic mantle plume.",2022-06-29
1720,Light-intensity-dependent photoresponse time of organic photodetectors and its molecular origin,"Organic photodetectors (OPDs) exhibit superior spectral responses but slower photoresponse times compared to inorganic counterparts. Herein, we study the light-intensity-dependent OPD photoresponse time with two small-molecule donors (planar MPTA or twisted NP-SA) co-evaporated with C60 acceptors. MPTA:C60 exhibits the fastest response time at high-light intensities (>0.5 mW/cm2), attributed to its planar structure favoring strong intermolecular interactions. However, this blend exhibits the slowest response at low-light intensities, which is correlated with biphasic photocurrent transients indicative of the presence of a low density of deep trap states. Optical, structural, and energetical analyses indicate that MPTA molecular packing is strongly disrupted by C60, resulting in a larger (370 meV) HOMO level shift. This results in greater energetic inhomogeneity including possible MPTA-C60 adduct formation, leading to deep trap states which limit the low-light photoresponse time. This work provides important insights into the small molecule design rules critical for low charge-trapping and high-speed OPD applications.",Understanding the charge trapping mechanism in organic semiconductors is crucial to design molecules for high-performance organic photodetectors.

1721,Scanning gradiometry with a single spin quantum magnetometer,"Quantum sensors based on spin defects in diamond have recently enabled detailed imaging of nanoscale magnetic patterns, such as chiral spin textures, two-dimensional ferromagnets, or superconducting vortices, based on a measurement of the static magnetic stray field. Here, we demonstrate a gradiometry technique that significantly enhances the measurement sensitivity of such static fields, leading to new opportunities in the imaging of weakly magnetic systems. Our method relies on the mechanical oscillation of a single nitrogen-vacancy center at the tip of a scanning diamond probe, which up-converts the local spatial gradients into ac magnetic fields enabling the use of sensitive ac quantum protocols. We show that gradiometry provides important advantages over static field imaging: (i) an order-of-magnitude better sensitivity, (ii) a more localized and sharper image, and (iii) a strong suppression of field drifts. We demonstrate the capabilities of gradiometry by imaging the nanotesla fields appearing above topographic defects and atomic steps in an antiferromagnet, direct currents in a graphene device, and para- and diamagnetic metals.","Scanning NV center magnetometry enables imaging of weak magnetic fields at the nanoscale. Huxter et al. achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity by converting a spatial field gradient into an AC field by mechanical oscillations of the sensor, and image stray fields from atomic steps in an antiferromagnet.",2022-06-29
1722,Perfluorocycloparaphenylenes,"Perfluorinated aromatic compounds, the so-called perfluoroarenes, are widely used in materials science owing to their high electron affinity and characteristic intermolecular interactions. However, methods to synthesize highly strained perfluoroarenes are limited, which greatly limits their structural diversity. Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of perfluorocycloparaphenylenes (PFCPPs) as a class of ring-shaped perfluoroarenes. Using macrocyclic nickel complexes, we succeeded in synthesizing PF[n]CPPs (n = 10, 12, 14, 16) in one-pot without noble metals. The molecular structures of PF[n]CPPs (n = 10, 12, 14) were determined by X-ray crystallography to confirm their tubular alignment. Photophysical and electrochemical measurements revealed that PF[n]CPPs (n = 10, 12, 14) exhibited wide HOMO–LUMO gaps, high reduction potentials, and strong phosphorescence at low temperature. PFCPPs are not only useful as electron-accepting organic materials but can also be used for accelerating the creation of topologically unique molecular nanocarbon materials.","Synthetic methods for the preparation of perfluorinated aromatic compounds are desirable in materials science. Here, the authors synthesize perfluorocycloparaphenylenes, fully fluorinated carbon nanorings, through a nickel-mediated one-pot method.",2022-06-28
1723,Lsm7 phase-separated condensates trigger stress granule formation,"Stress granules (SGs) are non-membranous organelles facilitating stress responses and linking the pathology of age-related diseases. In a genome-wide imaging-based phenomic screen, we identify Pab1 co-localizing proteins under 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) induced stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that deletion of one of the Pab1 co-localizing proteins, Lsm7, leads to a significant decrease in SG formation. Under 2-DG stress, Lsm7 rapidly forms foci that assist in SG formation. The Lsm7 foci form via liquid-liquid phase separation, and the intrinsically disordered region and the hydrophobic clusters within the Lsm7 sequence are the internal driving forces in promoting Lsm7 phase separation. The dynamic Lsm7 phase-separated condensates appear to work as seeding scaffolds, promoting Pab1 demixing and subsequent SG initiation, seemingly mediated by RNA interactions. The SG initiation mechanism, via Lsm7 phase separation, identified in this work provides valuable clues for understanding the mechanisms underlying SG formation and SG-associated human diseases.","Stress granules are non-membranous organelles connected to stress responses and age-related disease. Here, the authors identify a conserved yeast protein, Lsm7, that facilitates stress granule formation through dynamic liquid-liquid phase separation condensates upon 2-deoxy-D-glucose-induced stress.",2022-06-28
1724,Immunogenicity and reactogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines BNT162b2 and CoronaVac in healthy adolescents,"We present an interim analysis of a registered clinical study (NCT04800133) to establish immunobridging with various antibody and cellular immunity markers and to compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of 2-dose BNT162b2 and CoronaVac in healthy adolescents as primary objectives. One-dose BNT162b2, recommended in some localities for risk reduction of myocarditis, is also assessed. Antibodies and T cell immune responses are non-inferior or similar in adolescents receiving 2 doses of BNT162b2 (BB, N = 116) and CoronaVac (CC, N = 123) versus adults after 2 doses of the same vaccine (BB, N = 147; CC, N = 141) but not in adolescents after 1-dose BNT162b2 (B, N = 116). CC induces SARS-CoV-2 N and N C-terminal domain seropositivity in a higher proportion of adolescents than adults. Adverse reactions are mostly mild for both vaccines and more frequent for BNT162b2. We find higher S, neutralising, avidity and Fc receptor-binding antibody responses in adolescents receiving BB than CC, and a similar induction of strong S-specific T cells by the 2 vaccines, in addition to N- and M-specific T cells induced by CoronaVac but not BNT162b2, possibly implying differential durability and cross-variant protection by BNT162b2 and CoronaVac, the 2 most used SARS-CoV-2 vaccines worldwide. Our results support the use of both vaccines in adolescents.","There are adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccines, such as myocarditis for adolescents following receipt of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. Here the authors compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of two widely available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2, an mRNA vaccine, and CoronaVac, a whole-virus inactivated vaccine) in healthy adolescents.",2022-06-28
1725,The genomic basis of the plant island syndrome in Darwin’s giant daisies,"The repeated, rapid and often pronounced patterns of evolutionary divergence observed in insular plants, or the ‘plant island syndrome’, include changes in leaf phenotypes, growth, as well as the acquisition of a perennial lifestyle. Here, we sequence and describe the genome of the critically endangered, Galápagos-endemic species Scalesia atractyloides Arnot., obtaining a chromosome-resolved, 3.2-Gbp assembly containing 43,093 candidate gene models. Using a combination of fossil transposable elements, k-mer spectra analyses and orthologue assignment, we identify the two ancestral genomes, and date their divergence and the polyploidization event, concluding that the ancestor of all extant Scalesia species was an allotetraploid. There are a comparable number of genes and transposable elements across the two subgenomes, and while their synteny has been mostly conserved, we find multiple inversions that may have facilitated adaptation. We identify clear signatures of selection across genes associated with vascular development, growth, adaptation to salinity and flowering time, thus finding compelling evidence for a genomic basis of the island syndrome in one of Darwin’s giant daisies.","Many island plant species share a syndrome of characteristic phenotype and life history. Cerca et al. find the genomic basis of the plant island syndrome in one of Darwin’s giant daisies, while separating ancestral genomes in a chromosome-resolved polyploid assembly.",2022-06-28
1726,The impact of rare germline variants on human somatic mutation processes,"Somatic mutations are an inevitable component of ageing and the most important cause of cancer. The rates and types of somatic mutation vary across individuals, but relatively few inherited influences on mutation processes are known. We perform a gene-based rare variant association study with diverse mutational processes, using human cancer genomes from over 11,000 individuals of European ancestry. By combining burden and variance tests, we identify 207 associations involving 15 somatic mutational phenotypes and 42 genes that replicated in an independent data set at a false discovery rate of 1%. We associate rare inherited deleterious variants in genes such as MSH3, EXO1, SETD2, and MTOR with two phenotypically different forms of DNA mismatch repair deficiency, and variants in genes such as EXO1, PAXIP1, RIF1, and WRN with deficiency in homologous recombination repair. In addition, we identify associations with other mutational processes, such as APEX1 with APOBEC-signature mutagenesis. Many of the genes interact with each other and with known mutator genes within cellular sub-networks. Considered collectively, damaging variants in the identified genes are prevalent in the population. We suggest that rare germline variation in diverse genes commonly impacts mutational processes in somatic cells.","The impact of germline variants on somatic alterations in cancer remains to be explored in large-scale datasets. Here, the authors study the association of rare germline variants with somatic mutational processes in more than 15,000 tumors, and reveal that damaging variants in newly-identifed genes are prevalent in the population.",2022-06-28
1727,Learning representations of chromatin contacts using a recurrent neural network identifies genomic drivers of conformation,"Despite the availability of chromatin conformation capture experiments, discerning the relationship between the 1D genome and 3D conformation remains a challenge, which limits our understanding of their affect on gene expression and disease. We propose Hi-C-LSTM, a method that produces low-dimensional latent representations that summarize intra-chromosomal Hi-C contacts via a recurrent long short-term memory neural network model. We find that these representations contain all the information needed to recreate the observed Hi-C matrix with high accuracy, outperforming existing methods. These representations enable the identification of a variety of conformation-defining genomic elements, including nuclear compartments and conformation-related transcription factors. They furthermore enable in-silico perturbation experiments that measure the influence of cis-regulatory elements on conformation.","Despite the availability of chromatin conformation capture experiments, discerning the relationship between the 1D genome and 3D conformation remains a challenge.

1728,Clonal reconstruction from co-occurrence of vector integration sites accurately quantifies expanding clones in vivo,"High transduction rates of viral vectors in gene therapies (GT) and experimental hematopoiesis ensure a high frequency of gene delivery, although multiple integration events can occur in the same cell. Therefore, tracing of integration sites (IS) leads to mis-quantification of the true clonal spectrum and limits safety considerations in GT. Hence, we use correlations between repeated measurements of IS abundances to estimate their mutual similarity and identify clusters of co-occurring IS, for which we assume a clonal origin. We evaluate the performance, robustness and specificity of our methodology using clonal simulations. The reconstruction methods, implemented and provided as an R-package, are further applied to experimental clonal mixes and preclinical models of hematopoietic GT. Our results demonstrate that clonal reconstruction from IS data allows to overcome systematic biases in the clonal quantification as an essential prerequisite for the assessment of safety and long-term efficacy of GT involving integrative vectors.",High transduction rates of viral vectors ensure good gene delivery; however multiple integration events can occur in the same cell.

1729,SpySwitch enables pH- or heat-responsive capture and release for plug-and-display nanoassembly,"Proteins can be empowered via SpyTag for anchoring and nanoassembly, through covalent bonding to SpyCatcher partners. Here we generate a switchable version of SpyCatcher, allowing gentle purification of SpyTagged proteins. We introduce numerous histidines adjacent to SpyTag’s binding site, giving moderate pH-dependent release. After phage-based selection, our final SpySwitch allows purification of SpyTag- and SpyTag003-fusions from bacterial or mammalian culture by capture at neutral pH and release at pH 5, with purity far beyond His-tag methods. SpySwitch is also thermosensitive, capturing at 4 °C and releasing at 37 °C. With flexible choice of eluent, SpySwitch-purified proteins can directly assemble onto multimeric scaffolds. 60-mer multimerization enhances immunogenicity and we use SpySwitch to purify receptor-binding domains from SARS-CoV-2 and 11 other sarbecoviruses. For these receptor-binding domains we determine thermal resilience (for mosaic vaccine development) and cross-recognition by antibodies. Antibody EY6A reacts across all tested sarbecoviruses, towards potential application against new coronavirus pandemic threats.","The SpyCatcher-SpyTag system allows protein anchoring and nanoassembly.

1730,Lentivector cryptic splicing mediates increase in CD34+ clones expressing truncated HMGA2 in human X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency,"X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) due to IL2RG mutations is potentially fatal in infancy where ‘emergency’ life-saving stem cell transplant may only achieve incomplete immune reconstitution following transplant. Salvage therapy SCID-X1 patients over 2 years old (NCT01306019) is a non-randomized, open-label, phase I/II clinical trial for administration of lentiviral-transduced autologous hematopoietic stem cells following busulfan (6 mg/kg total) conditioning. The primary and secondary objectives assess efficacy in restoring immunity and safety by vector insertion site analysis (VISA). In this ongoing study (19 patients treated), we report VISA in blood lineages from first eight treated patients with longer follow up found a > 60-fold increase in frequency of forward-orientated VIS within intron 3 of the High Mobility Group AT-hook 2 gene. All eight patients demonstrated emergence of dominant HMGA2 VIS clones in progenitor and myeloid lineages, but without disturbance of hematopoiesis. Our molecular analysis demonstrated a cryptic splice site within the chicken β-globin hypersensitivity 4 insulator element in the vector generating truncated mRNA transcripts from many transcriptionally active gene containing forward-oriented intronic vector insert. A two base-pair change at the splice site within the lentiviral vector eliminated splicing activity while retaining vector functional capability. This highlights the importance of functional analysis of lentivectors for cryptic splicing for preclinical safety assessment and a redesign of clinical vectors to improve safety.","De Ravin et al. report an unplanned interim analysis of a secondary safety outcome for an ongoing clinical trial on lentiviral gene therapy for the treatment of X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (NCT01306019).

1731,Anionic polymerization of nonaromatic maleimide to achieve full-color nonconventional luminescence,"Nonconventional or nonconjugated luminophore without polycyclic aromatics or extended π-conjugation is a rising star in the area of luminescent materials. However, continuously tuning the emission color within a broad visible region via rational molecular design remains quite challenging because the mechanism of nonconventional luminescence is not fully understood. Herein, we present a new class of nonconventional luminophores, poly(maleimide)s (PMs), with full-color emission that can be finely regulated by anionic polymerization even at ambient temperature. Interestingly, the general characteristics of nonconventional luminescence, cluster-triggered emission, e.g., concentration-enhanced emission, are not observed in PMs. Instead, PMs have features similar to aggregation-caused quenching due to boosted intra/inter-molecular charge transfer. Such a biocompatible luminescent material synthesized from a low-cost monomer shows great prospects in large-scale production and applications, including security printing, fingerprint identification, metal ion recognition, etc. It also provides a new platform of rational molecular design to achieve full-color nonconventional luminescence without any aromatics.","Nonconventional luminophores without extended π-conjugation is a rising star in the area of luminescent materials but continuously tuning the emission color within a broad visible region via rational molecular design remains challenging.

1732,Network-based machine learning approach to predict immunotherapy response in cancer patients,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have substantially improved the survival of cancer patients over the past several years. However, only a minority of patients respond to ICI treatment (~30% in solid tumors), and current ICI-response-associated biomarkers often fail to predict the ICI treatment response. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework that leverages network-based analyses to identify ICI treatment biomarkers (NetBio) that can make robust predictions. We curate more than 700 ICI-treated patient samples with clinical outcomes and transcriptomic data, and observe that NetBio-based predictions accurately predict ICI treatment responses in three different cancer types—melanoma, gastric cancer, and bladder cancer. Moreover, the NetBio-based prediction is superior to predictions based on other conventional ICI treatment biomarkers, such as ICI targets or tumor microenvironment-associated markers. This work presents a network-based method to effectively select immunotherapy-response-associated biomarkers that can make robust ML-based predictions for precision oncology.","Identifying biomarkers for response to immunotherapy in cancer remains challenging.

1733,The timing of unprecedented hydrological drought under climate change,"Droughts that exceed the magnitudes of historical variation ranges could occur increasingly frequently under future climate conditions. However, the time of the emergence of unprecedented drought conditions under climate change has rarely been examined. Here, using multimodel hydrological simulations, we investigate the changes in the frequency of hydrological drought (defined as abnormally low river discharge) under high and low greenhouse gas concentration scenarios and existing water resource management measures and estimate the time of the first emergence of unprecedented regional drought conditions centered on the low-flow season. The times are detected for several subcontinental-scale regions, and three regions, namely, Southwestern South America, Mediterranean Europe, and Northern Africa, exhibit particularly robust results under the high-emission scenario. These three regions are expected to confront unprecedented conditions within the next 30 years with a high likelihood regardless of the emission scenarios. In addition, the results obtained herein demonstrate the benefits of the lower-emission pathway in reducing the likelihood of emergence. The Paris Agreement goals are shown to be effective in reducing the likelihood to the unlikely level in most regions. However, appropriate and prior adaptation measures are considered indispensable when facing unprecedented drought conditions. The results of this study underscore the importance of improving drought preparedness within the considered time horizons.",Significant regional disparities exist in the time left to prepare for unprecedented drought and how much we can buy time depending on climate scenarios.

1734,Evaporative water loss of 1.42 million global lakes,"The evaporative loss from global lakes (natural and artificial) is a critical component of the terrestrial water and energy balance. However, the evaporation volume of these water bodies—from the spatial distribution to the long-term trend—is as of yet unknown. Here, using satellite observations and modeling tools, we quantified the evaporation volume from 1.42 million global lakes from 1985 to 2018. We find that the long-term average lake evaporation is 1500 ± 150 km3 year−1 and it has increased at a rate of 3.12 km3 year−1. The trend attributions include an increasing evaporation rate (58%), decreasing lake ice coverage (23%), and increasing lake surface area (19%). While only accounting for 5% of the global lake storage capacity, artificial lakes (i.e., reservoirs) contribute 16% to the evaporation volume. Our results underline the importance of using evaporation volume, rather than evaporation rate, as the primary index for assessing climatic impacts on lake systems.","While the evaporative water loss from global lakes is invisible, the volume is substantial. In recent decades, lake evaporation volume has been significantly increasing due to enhanced evaporation rate, melting lake ice, and expansion of water extent.",2022-06-28
1735,Structural basis for mitoguardin-2 mediated lipid transport at ER-mitochondrial membrane contact sites,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact site (ERMCS) is crucial for exchanging biological molecules such as phospholipids and Ca2+ ions between these organelles. Mitoguardin-2 (MIGA2), a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, forms the ERMCS in higher eukaryotic cells. Here, we report the crystal structures of the MIGA2 Lipid Droplet (LD) targeting domain and the ER membrane protein VAPB bound to the phosphorylated FFAT motif of MIGA2. These structures reveal that the MIGA2 LD targeting domain has a large internal hydrophobic pocket that accommodates phospholipids and that two phosphorylations of the FFAT motif are required for tight interaction of MIGA2 with VAPB, which enhances the rate of lipid transport. Further biochemical studies show that MIGA2 transports phospholipids between membranes with a strong preference for binding and trafficking phosphatidylserine (PS). These results provide a structural and molecular basis for understanding how MIGA2 mediates the formation of ERMCS and facilitates lipid trafficking at the ERMCS.","The ER-mitochondria contact sites are crucial for exchanging phospholipids. Here, Kim et al. present crystal structures of mitoguardin-2 (MIGA2) which reveal that MIGA2 directly binds phospholipids and transfers them between the ER and mitochondria.",2022-06-28
1736,Evolution and activation mechanism of the flavivirus class II membrane-fusion machinery,"The flavivirus envelope glycoproteins prM and E drive the assembly of icosahedral, spiky immature particles that bud across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Maturation into infectious virions in the trans-Golgi network involves an acid-pH-driven rearrangement into smooth particles made of (prM/E)2 dimers exposing a furin site for prM cleavage into “pr” and “M”. Here we show that the prM “pr” moiety derives from an HSP40 cellular chaperonin. Furthermore, the X-ray structure of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (pr/E)2 dimer at acidic pH reveals the E 150-loop as a hinged-lid that opens at low pH to expose a positively-charged pr-binding pocket at the E dimer interface, inducing (prM/E)2 dimer formation to generate smooth particles in the Golgi. Furin cleavage is followed by lid-closure upon deprotonation in the neutral-pH extracellular environment, expelling pr while the 150-loop takes the relay in fusion loop protection, thus revealing the elusive flavivirus mechanism of fusion activation.","The mechanism of flavivirus activation for membrane fusion is not yet understood.

1737,Compositional dependence of the fragility in metallic glass forming liquids,"The viscosity and its temperature dependence, the fragility, are key properties of a liquid. A low fragility is believed to promote the formation of metallic glasses. Yet, the fragility remains poorly understood, since experimental data of its compositional dependence are scarce. Here, we introduce the film inflation method (FIM), which measures the fragility of metallic glass forming liquids across wide ranges of composition and glass-forming ability. We determine the fragility for 170 alloys ranging over 25 at.% in Mg–Cu–Y. Within this alloy system, large fragility variations are observed. Contrary to the general understanding, a low fragility does not correlate with high glass-forming ability here. We introduce crystallization complexity as an additional contribution, which can potentially become significant when modeling glass forming ability over many orders of magnitude.","In metallic liquids, the fragility is difficult to predict and measure. Here, the authors present the film inflation method, which reveals large fragility variations across Mg–Cu–Y, and introduce the crystallization complexity as additional contribution to glass forming ability.",2022-06-28
1738,Nanoscale self-organization and metastable non-thermal metallicity in Mott insulators,"Mott transitions in real materials are first order and almost always associated with lattice distortions, both features promoting the emergence of nanotextured phases. This nanoscale self-organization creates spatially inhomogeneous regions, which can host and protect transient non-thermal electronic and lattice states triggered by light excitation. Here, we combine time-resolved X-ray microscopy with a Landau-Ginzburg functional approach for calculating the strain and electronic real-space configurations. We investigate V2O3, the archetypal Mott insulator in which nanoscale self-organization already exists in the low-temperature monoclinic phase and strongly affects the transition towards the high-temperature corundum metallic phase. Our joint experimental-theoretical approach uncovers a remarkable out-of-equilibrium phenomenon: the photo-induced stabilisation of the long sought monoclinic metal phase, which is absent at equilibrium and in homogeneous materials, but emerges as a metastable state solely when light excitation is combined with the underlying nanotexture of the monoclinic lattice.","Mott metal-insulator transition in real materials is characterized by complex lattice and electron dynamics involving multiple length and time scales.

1739,Glutamine deficiency in solid tumor cells confers resistance to ribosomal RNA synthesis inhibitors,"Ribosome biogenesis is an energetically expensive program that is dictated by nutrient availability. Here we report that nutrient deprivation severely impairs precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed rRNAs. Upon nutrient restoration, pre-rRNAs stored under starvation are processed into mature rRNAs that are utilized for ribosome biogenesis. Failure to accumulate pre-rRNAs under nutrient stress leads to perturbed ribosome assembly upon nutrient restoration and subsequent apoptosis via uL5/uL18-mediated activation of p53. Restoration of glutamine alone activates p53 by triggering uL5/uL18 translation. Induction of uL5/uL18 protein synthesis by glutamine is dependent on the translation factor eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which is in turn dependent on Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. Depriving cells of glutamine prevents the activation of p53 by rRNA synthesis inhibitors. Our data reveals a mechanism that tumor cells can exploit to suppress p53-mediated apoptosis during fluctuations in environmental nutrient availability.","Small molecules that target RNA Polymerase I inhibit ribosome biogenesis to activate p53 through the nucleolar surveillance response pathway.

1740,Senescent cells limit p53 activity via multiple mechanisms to remain viable,"Super-enhancers regulate genes with important functions in processes that are cell type-specific or define cell identity. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts establish 40 senescence-associated super-enhancers regardless of how they become senescent, with 50 activated genes located in the vicinity of these enhancers. Here we show, through gene knockdown and analysis of three core biological properties of senescent cells that a relatively large number of senescence-associated super-enhancer-regulated genes promote survival of senescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Of these, Mdm2, Rnase4, and Ang act by suppressing p53-mediated apoptosis through various mechanisms that are also engaged in response to DNA damage. MDM2 and RNASE4 transcription is also elevated in human senescent fibroblasts to restrain p53 and promote survival. These insights identify key survival mechanisms of senescent cells and provide molecular entry points for the development of targeted therapeutics that eliminate senescent cells at sites of pathology.","To develop therapeutics that selectively eliminate pathological senescent cells it is important to understand their survival mechanisms. Here, the authors show that senescent cells manage to survive by keeping p53 activity in check through multiple mechanisms, including inhibitory mechanisms that involve p53 binding to ribonucleases.",2022-06-28
1741,Flood exposure and poverty in 188 countries,"Flooding is among the most prevalent natural hazards, with particularly disastrous impacts in low-income countries. This study presents global estimates of the number of people exposed to high flood risks in interaction with poverty. It finds that 1.81 billion people (23% of world population) are directly exposed to 1-in-100-year floods. Of these, 1.24 billion are located in South and East Asia, where China (395 million) and India (390 million) account for over one-third of global exposure. Low- and middle-income countries are home to 89% of the world’s flood-exposed people. Of the 170 million facing high flood risk and extreme poverty (living on under $1.90 per day), 44% are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Over 780 million of those living on under $5.50 per day face high flood risk. Using state-of-the-art poverty and flood data, our findings highlight the scale and priority regions for flood mitigation measures to support resilient development.","Floods are most devastating for those who can least afford to be hit.

1742,Pancreatic α and β cells are globally phase-locked,"The Ca2+ modulated pulsatile glucagon and insulin secretions by pancreatic α and β cells play a crucial role in glucose homeostasis. However, how α and β cells coordinate to produce various Ca2+ oscillation patterns is still elusive. Using a microfluidic device and transgenic mice, we recorded Ca2+ signals from islet α and β cells, and observed heterogeneous Ca2+ oscillation patterns intrinsic to each islet. After a brief period of glucose stimulation, α and β cells’ oscillations were globally phase-locked. While the activation of α cells displayed a fixed time delay of ~20 s to that of β cells, β cells activated with a tunable period. Moreover, islet α cell number correlated with oscillation frequency. We built a mathematical model of islet Ca2+ oscillation incorporating paracrine interactions, which quantitatively agreed with the experimental data. Our study highlights the importance of cell-cell interaction in generating stable but tunable islet oscillation patterns.","The Ca2+ modulated pulsatile glucagon and insulin secretions by pancreatic α and β cells are critical in glucose homeostasis.

1743,Surface plasmons induce topological transition in graphene/α-MoO3 heterostructures,"Polaritons in hyperbolic van der Waals materials—where principal axes have permittivities of opposite signs—are light-matter modes with unique properties and promising applications. Isofrequency contours of hyperbolic polaritons may undergo topological transitions from open hyperbolas to closed ellipse-like curves, prompting an abrupt change in physical properties. Electronically-tunable topological transitions are especially desirable for future integrated technologies but have yet to be demonstrated. In this work, we present a doping-induced topological transition effected by plasmon-phonon hybridization in graphene/α-MoO3 heterostructures. Scanning near-field optical microscopy was used to image hybrid polaritons in graphene/α-MoO3. We demonstrate the topological transition and characterize hybrid modes, which can be tuned from surface waves to bulk waveguide modes, traversing an exceptional point arising from the anisotropic plasmon-phonon coupling. Graphene/α-MoO3 heterostructures offer the possibility to explore dynamical topological transitions and directional coupling that could inspire new nanophotonic and quantum devices.","Hyperbolic phonon polaritons – mixed states of photons and anisotropic lattice vibrations – offer appealing properties for nanophotonic applications. Here, the authors show that the plasmon-phonon hybridization upon electronic doping in graphene/α-MoO3 heterostructures can induce topological transitions of the polariton wavefront.",2022-06-28
1744,Orthogonal interlayer coupling in an all-antiferromagnetic junction,"In conventional ferromagnet/spacer/ferromagnet sandwiches, noncollinear couplings are commonly absent because of the low coupling energy and strong magnetization. For antiferromagnets (AFM), the small net moment can embody a low coupling energy as a sizable coupling field, however, such AFM sandwich structures have been scarcely explored. Here we demonstrate orthogonal interlayer coupling at room temperature in an all-antiferromagnetic junction Fe2O3/Cr2O3/Fe2O3, where the Néel vectors in the top and bottom Fe2O3 layers are strongly orthogonally coupled and the coupling strength is significantly affected by the thickness of the antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 spacer. From the energy and symmetry analysis, the direct coupling via uniform magnetic ordering in Cr2O3 spacer in our junction is excluded. The coupling is proposed to be mediated by the non-uniform domain wall state in the spacer. The strong long-range coupling in an antiferromagnetic junction provides an unexplored approach for designing antiferromagnetic structures and makes it a promising building block for antiferromagnetic devices.","Ferromagnet/spacer/ferromagnet sandwiches have been studied extensively, and used in a variety of spintronic devices. Here, Zhou et al. create an all anti-ferromagnetic sandwich of Fe2O3/Cr2O3/Fe2O3, and demonstrate strong orthogonal coupling between the top and bottom Fe2O3 layers.",2022-06-28
1745,Upcycling Compact Discs for Flexible and Stretchable Bioelectronic Applications,"Electronic waste is a global issue brought about by the short lifespan of electronics. Viable methods to relieve the inundated disposal system by repurposing the enormous amount of electronic waste remain elusive. Inspired by the need for sustainable solutions, this study resulted in a multifaceted approach to upcycling compact discs. The once-ubiquitous plates can be transformed into stretchable and flexible biosensors. Our experiments and advanced prototypes show that effective, innovative biosensors can be developed at a low-cost. An affordable craft-based mechanical cutter allows pre-determined patterns to be scored on the recycled metal, an essential first step for producing stretchable, wearable electronics. The active metal harvested from the compact discs was inert, cytocompatible, and capable of vital biopotential measurements. Additional studies examined the material’s resistive emittance, temperature sensing, real-time metabolite monitoring performance, and moisture-triggered transience. This sustainable approach for upcycling electronic waste provides an advantageous research-based waste stream that does not require cutting-edge microfabrication facilities, expensive materials, and high-caliber engineering skills.","Electronic waste is a global issue brought about by the short lifespan of electronics. Here, the authors report a process to upcycle compact discs into flexible and stretchable bio-electronics.",2022-06-28
1746,A degradative to secretory autophagy switch mediates mitochondria clearance in the absence of the mATG8-conjugation machinery,"PINK1-Parkin mediated mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy, represents one of the most important mechanisms in mitochondrial quality control (MQC) via the clearance of damaged mitochondria. Although it is well known that the conjugation of mammalian ATG8s (mATG8s) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a key step in autophagy, its role in mitophagy remains controversial. In this study, we clarify the role of the mATG8-conjugation system in mitophagy by generating knockouts of the mATG8-conjugation machinery. Unexpectedly, we show that mitochondria could still be cleared in the absence of the mATG8-conjugation system, in a process independent of lysosomal degradation. Instead, mitochondria are cleared via extracellular release through a secretory autophagy pathway, in a process we define as Autophagic Secretion of Mitochondria (ASM). Functionally, increased ASM promotes the activation of the innate immune cGAS-STING pathway in recipient cells. Overall, this study reveals ASM as a mechanism in MQC when the cellular mATG8-conjugation machinery is dysfunctional and highlights the critical role of mATG8 lipidation in suppressing inflammatory responses.","The mechanisms underlying mitochondrial quality control are not fully understood. Here the authors identify a switch from degradative to secretory autophagy in the absence of the mATG8-conjugation system, termed Autophagic Secretion of Mitochondria.",2022-06-28
1747,Long COVID burden and risk factors in 10 UK longitudinal studies and electronic health records,"The frequency of, and risk factors for, long COVID are unclear among community-based individuals with a history of COVID-19. To elucidate the burden and possible causes of long COVID in the community, we coordinated analyses of survey data from 6907 individuals with self-reported COVID-19 from 10 UK longitudinal study (LS) samples and 1.1 million individuals with COVID-19 diagnostic codes in electronic healthcare records (EHR) collected by spring 2021. Proportions of presumed COVID-19 cases in LS reporting any symptoms for 12+ weeks ranged from 7.8% and 17% (with 1.2 to 4.8% reporting debilitating symptoms). Increasing age, female sex, white ethnicity, poor pre-pandemic general and mental health, overweight/obesity, and asthma were associated with prolonged symptoms in both LS and EHR data, but findings for other factors, such as cardio-metabolic parameters, were inconclusive.","Current understanding of Long COVID is limited, in part, due to lack of evidence from population-representative studies. Here, the authors analyse data from ten UK population-based studies and electronic health records, and find wide variation in the frequency of Long COVID between studies but some consistent risk factors.",2022-06-28
1748,MYCN-driven fatty acid uptake is a metabolic vulnerability in neuroblastoma,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood cancer arising from sympatho-adrenal neural crest cells. MYCN amplification is found in half of high-risk NB patients; however, no available therapies directly target MYCN. Using multi-dimensional metabolic profiling in MYCN expression systems and primary patient tumors, we comprehensively characterized the metabolic landscape driven by MYCN in NB. MYCN amplification leads to glycerolipid accumulation by promoting fatty acid (FA) uptake and biosynthesis. We found that cells expressing amplified MYCN depend highly on FA uptake for survival. Mechanistically, MYCN directly upregulates FA transport protein 2 (FATP2), encoded by SLC27A2. Genetic depletion of SLC27A2 impairs NB survival, and pharmacological SLC27A2 inhibition selectively suppresses tumor growth, prolongs animal survival, and exerts synergistic anti-tumor effects when combined with conventional chemotherapies in multiple preclinical NB models. This study identifies FA uptake as a critical metabolic dependency for MYCN-amplified tumors. Inhibiting FA uptake is an effective approach for improving current treatment regimens.","Half of high-risk neuroblastoma patients have MYCN amplification. Here, the authors show that MYCN induces fatty acid uptake and synthesis to support neuroblastoma and inhibition of a fatty acid transporter impairs tumor progression in preclinical models.",2022-06-28
1749,Maternal immune response and placental antibody transfer after COVID-19 vaccination across trimester and platforms,"The availability of three COVID-19 vaccines in the United States provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine how vaccine platforms and timing of vaccination in pregnancy impact maternal and neonatal immunity. Here, we characterize the antibody profile after Ad26.COV2.S, mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccination in 158 pregnant individuals and evaluate transplacental antibody transfer by profiling maternal and umbilical cord blood in 175 maternal-neonatal dyads. These analyses reveal lower vaccine-induced functions and Fc receptor-binding after Ad26.COV2.S compared to mRNA vaccination and subtle advantages in titer and function with mRNA-1273 versus BN162b2. mRNA vaccines have higher titers and functions against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. First and third trimester vaccination results in enhanced maternal antibody-dependent NK-cell activation, cellular and neutrophil phagocytosis, and complement deposition relative to second trimester. Higher transplacental transfer ratios following first and second trimester vaccination may reflect placental compensation for waning maternal titers. These results provide novel insight into the impact of platform and trimester of vaccination on maternal humoral immune response and transplacental antibody transfer.","Pregnant individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at high risk of morbidity and mortality, in addition to adverse pregnancy outcomes, yet little is known regarding trimester-specific immunity and maternal protection from COVID-19 vaccine platforms. Authors utilise a systems serology approach to characterise the material antibody response and the transplacental antibody transfer, dependent on vaccine platform and trimester of vaccination.",2022-06-28
1750,SHLD1 is dispensable for 53BP1-dependent V(D)J recombination but critical for productive class switch recombination,"SHLD1 is part of the Shieldin (SHLD) complex, which acts downstream of 53BP1 to counteract DNA double-strand break (DSB) end resection and promote DNA repair via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). While 53BP1 is essential for immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch recombination (CSR), long-range V(D)J recombination and repair of RAG-induced DSBs in XLF-deficient cells, the function of SHLD during these processes remains elusive. Here we report that SHLD1 is dispensable for lymphocyte development and RAG-mediated V(D)J recombination, even in the absence of XLF. By contrast, SHLD1 is essential for restricting resection at AID-induced DSB ends in both NHEJ-proficient and NHEJ-deficient B cells, providing an end-protection mechanism that permits productive CSR by NHEJ and alternative end-joining. Finally, we show that this SHLD1 function is required for orientation-specific joining of AID-initiated DSBs. Our data thus suggest that 53BP1 promotes V(D)J recombination and CSR through two distinct mechanisms: SHLD-independent synapsis of V(D)J segments and switch regions within chromatin, and SHLD-dependent protection of AID-DSB ends against resection.","SHLD1, as a component of the Shieldin (SHLD) complex, mediates DNA repair via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), an essential process during lymphocyte development. Here the authors show that SHLD1 is actually dispensable for lymphocyte development and V(D)J recombination, but is essential for class-switching recombination in activated B cells.",2022-06-28
1751,Copper-catalyzed regio- and stereo-selective hydrosilylation of terminal allenes to access (E)-allylsilanes,"Regioselectivity and stereoselectivity control in hydrosilylation of terminal allenes is challeging. Although the selective synthesis of vinylsilanes, branched allylsilanes or linear (Z)-allylsilanes have been achieved, transition-metal catalyzed hydrosilylation of terminal allenes to access (E)-allylsilane is difficult. Herein, we report a copper-catalyzed selective hydrosilylation reaction of terminal allenes to access (E)-allylsilanes under mild reaction conditions. The reaction shows broad substrate scope, representing an efficient method to prepare trisubstituted (E)-allylsilanes through hydrosilylation reaction of allenes and can also be applied in the synthesis of disubstituted (E)-allylsilanes. The mechanism study reveals that the E-selectivity is kinetically controlled by the catalyst but not by the thermodynamically isomerization of the (Z)-isomer.","Regio- and stereoselective transition-metal catalysed hydrosilylation of terminal allenes to access (E)-allylsilanes are challenging organic transformations.

1752,Separate luminous structures leading positive leader steps,"The physics governing the propagation of lightning leaders and long spark leaders is still not well understood. Positive and negative leaders seem to behave differently. Negative leaders develop in a step manner, guided by the separate luminous structures termed space stems and space leaders. Positive leaders, on the other hand, are generally thought to have no separate luminous structure involved in their propagation. However, a separate luminous structure observed in a positive leader discharge had been reported in recent literature, suggesting that positive leaders may similarly do steps to negative leaders under certain conditions. Here we report the observation of the positive leader step led by a separate luminous structure at high humidity in laboratory lightning-like discharges. We also found the streamer-like common zone connecting the primary leader channel with the separate luminous structure, as well as the bi-directional development of the separate luminous structure. We hope that these findings would contribute to a better understanding of the nature underlying positive long spark leaders and lightning leaders.",The lightning's nature is that different-polarity leaders extend in air. Only negative leaders' development was previously associated to floating plasma. We found that the floating plasma could also lead the positive leader stepwise development.,2022-06-27
1753,"Demonstration of a superconducting diode-with-memory, operational at zero magnetic field with switchable nonreciprocity","Diode is one of the basic electronic components. It has a nonreciprocal current response, associated with a broken space/time reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate prototypes of superconducting diodes operational at zero magnetic field. They are based on conventional niobium planar Josephson junctions, in which space/time symmetry is broken by a combination of self-field effect from nonuniform bias and stray fields from a trapped Abrikosov vortex. We demonstrate that nonreciprocity of critical current in such diodes can reach an order of magnitude and rectification efficiency can exceed 70%. Furthermore, we can easily change the diode polarity and switch nonreciprocity on/off by changing the bias configuration and by trapping/removing of a vortex. This facilitates a memory functionality. We argue that such a diode-with-memory can be used for a future generation of in-memory superconducting computers.","Superconducting diodes, operational at zero magnetic field, can be used in supercomputers.

1754,Third harmonic characterization of antiferromagnetic heterostructures,"Electrical switching of antiferromagnets is an exciting recent development in spintronics, which promises active antiferromagnetic devices with high speed and low energy cost. In this emerging field, there is an active debate about the mechanisms of current-driven switching of antiferromagnets. For heavy-metal/ferromagnet systems, harmonic characterization is a powerful tool to quantify current-induced spin-orbit torques and spin Seebeck effect and elucidate current-induced switching. However, harmonic measurement of spin-orbit torques has never been verified in antiferromagnetic heterostructures. Here, we report harmonic measurements in Pt/α-Fe2O3 bilayers, which are explained by our modeling of higher-order harmonic voltages. As compared with ferromagnetic heterostructures where all current-induced effects appear in the second harmonic signals, the damping-like torque and thermally-induced magnetoelastic effect contributions in Pt/α-Fe2O3 emerge in the third harmonic voltage. Our results provide a new path to probe the current-induced magnetization dynamics in antiferromagnets, promoting the application of antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.","Harmonic measurements have been used extensively in ferromagnetic/heavy metal heterostructures to characterize the magnetization dynamic; however, it has remained unclear about whether such techniques could be applied to antiferromagnetic devices.

1755,Groundwater discharge as a driver of methane emissions from Arctic lakes,"Lateral CH4 inputs to Arctic lakes through groundwater discharge could be substantial and constitute an important pathway that links CH4 production in thawing permafrost to atmospheric emissions via lakes. Yet, groundwater CH4 inputs and associated drivers are hitherto poorly constrained because their dynamics and spatial variability are largely unknown. Here, we unravel the important role and drivers of groundwater discharge for CH4 emissions from Arctic lakes. Spatial patterns across lakes suggest groundwater inflows are primarily related to lake depth and wetland cover. Groundwater CH4 inputs to lakes are higher in summer than in autumn and are influenced by hydrological (groundwater recharge) and biological drivers (CH4 production). This information on the spatial and temporal patterns on groundwater discharge at high northern latitudes is critical for predicting lake CH4 emissions in the warming Arctic, as rising temperatures, increasing precipitation, and permafrost thawing may further exacerbate groundwater CH4 inputs to lakes.",CH4 inputs to Arctic lakes via groundwater discharge are an important pathway that links CH4 production in thawing permafrost to emission via lakes.

1756,Tailoring the metal electrode morphology via electrochemical protocol optimization for long-lasting aqueous zinc batteries,"Aqueous zinc metal batteries are a viable candidate for cost-effective energy storage. However, the cycle life of the cell is adversely affected by the morphological evolution of the metal electrode surface upon prolonged cycling. Here, we investigate different electrochemical protocols to favour the formation of stable zinc metal electrode surface morphologies. By coupling electrochemical and optical microscopy measurements, we demonstrate that an initial zinc deposition on the metal electrode allows homogeneous stripping and plating processes during prolonged cycling in symmetric Zn||Zn cell. Interestingly, when an initially plated zinc metal electrode is tested in combination with a manganese dioxide-based positive electrode and a two molar zinc sulfate aqueous electrolyte solution in coin cell configuration, a specific discharge capacity of about 90 mAh g−1 can be delivered after 2000 cycles at around 5.6 mA cm−2 and 25 °C.","Long-lasting zinc metal electrodes are crucial in developing commercial zinc-based batteries. Here, the authors investigate the different morphology evolution between the stripping and plating process and propose electrochemical protocols to prolong the lifespan of zinc anodes.",2022-06-27
1757,"A unique Co@CoO catalyst for hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-dimethylfuran","The development of precious-metal-free catalysts to promote the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from biomass remains an important and challenging target. Here, we report the efficient hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-dimethylfuran over a unique core-shell structured catalyst, Co@CoO that affords the highest productivity among all catalysts, including noble-metal-based catalysts, reported to date. Surprisingly, we find that the catalytically active sites reside on the shell of CoO with oxygen vacancies rather than the metallic Co. The combination of various spectroscopic experiments and computational modelling reveals that the CoO shell incorporating oxygen vacancies not only drives the heterolytic cleavage, but also the homolytic cleavage of H2 to yield more active Hδ− species, resulting in the exceptional catalytic activity. Co@CoO also exhibits excellent activity toward the direct hydrodeoxygenation of lignin model compounds. This study unlocks, for the first time, the potential of simple metal-oxide-based catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of renewable biomass to chemical feedstocks.",The development of precious-metal-free catalysts to promote the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from biomass challenging.

1758,G1/S restriction point coordinates phasic gene expression and cell differentiation,"Pluripotent embryonic stem cells have a unique cell cycle structure with a suppressed G1/S restriction point and little differential expression across the cell cycle phases. Here, we evaluate the link between G1/S restriction point activation, phasic gene expression, and cellular differentiation. Expression analysis reveals a gain in phasic gene expression across lineages between embryonic days E7.5 and E9.5. Genetic manipulation of the G1/S restriction point regulators miR-302 and P27 respectively accelerates or delays the onset of phasic gene expression in mouse embryos. Loss of miR-302-mediated p21 or p27 suppression expedites embryonic stem cell differentiation, while a constitutive Cyclin E mutant blocks it. Together, these findings uncover a causal relationship between emergence of the G1/S restriction point with a gain in phasic gene expression and cellular differentiation.","Somatic cells display phasic gene expression with compartmentalized gene expression during the cell cycle, while pluripotent cells lack phasic expression. Here, the authors describe a pathway linking microRNA regulation of the G1/S restriction point with phasic gene expression and cell differentiation during mammalian development.",2022-06-27
1759,Common genetic variation associated with Mendelian disease severity revealed through cryptic phenotype analysis,"Clinical heterogeneity is common in Mendelian disease, but small sample sizes make it difficult to identify specific contributing factors. However, if a disease represents the severely affected extreme of a spectrum of phenotypic variation, then modifier effects may be apparent within a larger subset of the population. Analyses that take advantage of this full spectrum could have substantially increased power. To test this, we developed cryptic phenotype analysis, a model-based approach that infers quantitative traits that capture disease-related phenotypic variability using qualitative symptom data. By applying this approach to 50 Mendelian diseases in two cohorts, we identify traits that reliably quantify disease severity. We then conduct genome-wide association analyses for five of the inferred cryptic phenotypes, uncovering common variation that is predictive of Mendelian disease-related diagnoses and outcomes. Overall, this study highlights the utility of computationally-derived phenotypes and biobank-scale cohorts for investigating the complex genetic architecture of Mendelian diseases.","The severity of rare genetic diseases often varies between individuals, but small sample sizes make it difficult to identify contributing factors. Here, the authors use biobank-scale clinical and genetic data to investigate a role for common genetic variation.",2022-06-27
1760,The importance of DNAPKcs for blunt DNA end joining is magnified when XLF is weakened,"Canonical non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ) factors can assemble into a long-range (LR) complex with DNA ends relatively far apart that contains DNAPKcs, XLF, XRCC4, LIG4, and the KU heterodimer and a short-range (SR) complex lacking DNAPKcs that has the ends positioned for ligation. Since the SR complex can form de novo, the role of the LR complex (i.e., DNAPKcs) for chromosomal EJ is unclear. We have examined EJ of chromosomal blunt DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and found that DNAPKcs is significantly less important than XLF for such EJ. However, weakening XLF via disrupting interaction interfaces causes a marked requirement for DNAPKcs, its kinase activity, and its ABCDE-cluster autophosphorylation sites for blunt DSB EJ. In contrast, other aspects of genome maintenance are sensitive to DNAPKcs kinase inhibition in a manner that is not further enhanced by XLF loss (i.e., suppression of homology-directed repair and structural variants, and IR-resistance). We suggest that DNAPKcs is required to position a weakened XLF in an LR complex that can transition into a functional SR complex for blunt DSB EJ, but also has distinct functions for other aspects of genome maintenance.","DNAPKcs and its kinase activity are required for blunt DNA break end joining when the bridging factor XLF is weakened, but for homologous recombination and radiation resistance, the influence of DNAPKcs is not further enhanced with loss of XLF.",2022-06-27
1761,Combinatorial immunotherapies overcome MYC-driven immune evasion in triple negative breast cancer,"Few patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors with complete and durable remissions being quite rare. Oncogenes can regulate tumor immune infiltration, however whether oncogenes dictate diminished response to immunotherapy and whether these effects are reversible remains poorly understood. Here, we report that TNBCs with elevated MYC expression are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Using mouse models and patient data, we show that MYC signaling is associated with low tumor cell PD-L1, low overall immune cell infiltration, and low tumor cell MHC-I expression. Restoring interferon signaling in the tumor increases MHC-I expression. By combining a TLR9 agonist and an agonistic antibody against OX40 with anti-PD-L1, mice experience tumor regression and are protected from new TNBC tumor outgrowth. Our findings demonstrate that MYC-dependent immune evasion is reversible and druggable, and when strategically targeted, may improve outcomes for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.","The oncoprotein c-Myc is often overexpressed in triple negative breast cancer and has a role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Here the authors show that elevated MYC expression is correlated with low immune infiltration, diminished MHC-I pathway expression and that CpG/aOX40 treatment could overcome resistance to PD-L1 blockade in MYC-high breast tumors.",2022-06-27
1762,Low-cost synthesis of small molecule acceptors makes polymer solar cells commercially viable,"The acceptor-donor-acceptor (A–D–A) or A–DA’D–A structured small molecule acceptors (SMAs) have triggered substantial progress for polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, the high−cost of the SMAs impedes the commercial viability of such renewable energy, as their synthesis via the classical pyridine-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation usually suffers from low reaction efficiency and tedious purifying work-up. Herein, we developed a simple and cheap boron trifluoride etherate-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation for addressing this challenge, and found that the coupling of the aldehyde-terminated D unit and the A-end groups could be quantitatively finished in the presence of acetic anhydride within 15 minutes at room temperature. Compared with the conventional method, the high reaction efficiency of our method is related to the germinal diacetate pathway that is thermodynamically favorable to give the final products. For those high performing SMAs (such as ITIC-4F and Y6), the cost could be reduced by 50% compared with conventional preparation. In addition to the application in PSCs, our synthetic approach provides a facile and low-cost access to a wide range of D–A organic semiconductors for emerging technologies.","The high−cost of the acceptor-donor-acceptor structured small molecule acceptors impedes its commercial viability for polymer solar cells.

1763,Laboratory evolution of synthetic electron transport system variants reveals a larger metabolic respiratory system and its plasticity,"The bacterial respiratory electron transport system (ETS) is branched to allow condition-specific modulation of energy metabolism. There is a detailed understanding of the structural and biochemical features of respiratory enzymes; however, a holistic examination of the system and its plasticity is lacking. Here we generate four strains of Escherichia coli harboring unbranched ETS that pump 1, 2, 3, or 4 proton(s) per electron and characterized them using a combination of synergistic methods (adaptive laboratory evolution, multi-omic analyses, and computation of proteome allocation). We report that: (a) all four ETS variants evolve to a similar optimized growth rate, and (b) the laboratory evolutions generate specific rewiring of major energy-generating pathways, coupled to the ETS, to optimize ATP production capability. We thus define an Aero-Type System (ATS), which is a generalization of the aerobic bioenergetics and is a metabolic systems biology description of respiration and its inherent plasticity.",The bacterial respiratory electron transport system (ETS) is branched to allow condition-specific modulation of energy metabolism.

1764,Light-induced charge generation in polymeric nanoparticles restores vision in advanced-stage retinitis pigmentosa rats,"Retinal dystrophies such as Retinitis pigmentosa are among the most prevalent causes of inherited legal blindness, for which treatments are in demand. Retinal prostheses have been developed to stimulate the inner retinal network that, initially spared by degeneration, deteriorates in the late stages of the disease. We recently reported that conjugated polymer nanoparticles persistently rescue visual activities after a single subretinal injection in the Royal College of Surgeons rat model of Retinitis pigmentosa. Here we demonstrate that conjugated polymer nanoparticles can reinstate physiological signals at the cortical level and visually driven activities when microinjected in 10-months-old Royal College of Surgeons rats bearing fully light-insensitive retinas. The extent of visual restoration positively correlates with the nanoparticle density and hybrid contacts with second-order retinal neurons. The results establish the functional role of organic photovoltaic nanoparticles in restoring visual activities in fully degenerate retinas with intense inner retina rewiring, a stage of the disease in which patients are subjected to prosthetic interventions.",Retinal dystrophies such as Retinitis pigmentosa are among the most prevalent causes of inherited incurable legal blindness.

1765,Hsp multichaperone complex buffers pathologically modified Tau,"Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder in which misfolding and aggregation of pathologically modified Tau is critical for neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. The two central chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 coordinate protein homeostasis, but the nature of the interaction of Tau with the Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery has remained enigmatic. Here we show that Tau is a high-affinity substrate of the human Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery. Complex formation involves extensive intermolecular contacts, blocks Tau aggregation and depends on Tau’s aggregation-prone repeat region. The Hsp90 co-chaperone p23 directly binds Tau and stabilizes the multichaperone/substrate complex, whereas the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CHIP efficiently disassembles the machinery targeting Tau to proteasomal degradation. Because phosphorylated Tau binds the Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery but is not recognized by Hsp90 alone, the data establish the Hsp70/Hsp90 multichaperone complex as a critical regulator of Tau in neurodegenerative diseases.","Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the accumulation of aggregated tau protein.

1766,The 22q11.2 region regulates presynaptic gene-products linked to schizophrenia,"It is unclear how the 22q11.2 deletion predisposes to psychiatric disease. To study this, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells from deletion carriers and controls and utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce the heterozygous deletion into a control cell line. Here, we show that upon differentiation into neural progenitor cells, the deletion acted in trans to alter the abundance of transcripts associated with risk for neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. In excitatory neurons, altered transcripts encoded presynaptic factors and were associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia, including common and rare variants. To understand how the deletion contributed to these changes, we defined the minimal protein-protein interaction network that best explains gene expression alterations. We found that many genes in 22q11.2 interact in presynaptic, proteasome, and JUN/FOS transcriptional pathways. Our findings suggest that the 22q11.2 deletion impacts genes that may converge with psychiatric risk loci to influence disease manifestation in each deletion carrier.","How the 22q11.2 deletion predisposes to psychiatric disease is unclear.

1767,A patatin-like phospholipase mediates Rickettsia parkeri escape from host membranes,"Rickettsia species of the spotted fever group are arthropod-borne obligate intracellular bacteria that can cause mild to severe human disease. These bacteria invade host cells, replicate in the cell cytosol, and spread from cell to cell. To access the host cytosol and avoid immune detection, they escape membrane-bound vacuoles by expressing factors that disrupt host membranes. Here, we show that a patatin-like phospholipase A2 enzyme (Pat1) facilitates Rickettsia parkeri infection by promoting escape from host membranes and cell-cell spread. Pat1 is important for infection in a mouse model and, at the cellular level, is crucial for efficiently escaping from single and double membrane-bound vacuoles into the host cytosol, and for avoiding host galectins that mark damaged membranes. Pat1 is also important for avoiding host polyubiquitin, preventing recruitment of autophagy receptor p62, and promoting actin-based motility and cell-cell spread.","Pathogenic Rickettsia species are arthropod-borne, obligate intracellular bacteria that invade host cells, replicate in the cell cytosol, and spread from cell to cell.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts within a myelomatous microenvironment remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the osteocyte-expressed major histocompatibility complex class II transactivator (CIITA) contributes to myeloma-induced bone lesions. CIITA upregulates the secretion of osteolytic cytokines from osteocytes through acetylation at histone 3 lysine 14 in the promoter of TNFSF11 (encoding RANKL) and SOST (encoding sclerostin), leading to enhanced osteoclastogenesis and decreased osteoblastogenesis. In turn, myeloma cell–secreted 2-deoxy-D-ribose, the product of thymidine catalyzed by the function of thymidine phosphorylase, upregulates CIITA expression in osteocytes through the STAT1/IRF1 signaling pathway. Our work thus broadens the understanding of myeloma-induced osteolysis and indicates a potential strategy for disrupting tumor-osteocyte interaction to prevent or treat patients with myeloma bone disease.",Osteocytes play an important role in the development and progression of tumour-associated bone disease. Here the authors report an interaction between malignant plasma cells and osteocytes in multiple myeloma and show that the osteocyte-expressed major histocompatibility complex class II transactivator (CIITA) contributes to myeloma-induced bone lesions.,2022-06-27
1769,High-dimensional profiling reveals Tc17 cell enrichment in active Crohn’s disease and identifies a potentially targetable signature,"The immune-pathology in Crohn’s disease is linked to dysregulated CD4+ T cell responses biased towards pathogenic TH17 cells. However, the role of CD8+ T cells able to produce IL-17 (Tc17 cells) remains unclear. Here we characterize the peripheral blood and intestinal tissue of Crohn’s disease patients (n = 61) with flow and mass cytometry and reveal a strong increase of Tc17 cells in active disease, mainly due to induction of conventional T cells. Mass cytometry shows that Tc17 cells express a distinct immune signature (CD6high, CD39, CD69, PD-1, CD27low) which was validated in an independent patient cohort. This signature stratifies patients into groups with distinct flare-free survival associated with differential CD6 expression. Targeting of CD6 in vitro reduces IL-17, IFN-γ and TNF production. These results identify a distinct Tc17 cell population in Crohn’s disease with proinflammatory features linked to disease activity. The Tc17 signature informs clinical outcomes and may guide personalized treatment decisions.",The T cell compartment in patients with Crohn's disease is dysregulated. Here the authors use cytometric profiling to reveal an enrichment of distinct Tc17 cells during active Crohn's disease and may suggest CD6 as a potential target for therapeutic studies.,2022-06-27
1770,Sustainable wood electronics by iron-catalyzed laser-induced graphitization for large-scale applications,"Ecologically friendly wood electronics will help alleviating the shortcomings of state-of-art cellulose-based “green electronics”. Here we introduce iron-catalyzed laser-induced graphitization (IC-LIG) as an innovative approach for engraving large-scale electrically conductive structures on wood with very high quality and efficiency, overcoming the limitations of conventional LIG including high ablation, thermal damages, need for multiple lasing steps, use of fire retardants and inert atmospheres. An aqueous bio-based coating, inspired by historical iron-gall ink, protects wood from laser ablation and thermal damage while promoting efficient graphitization and smoothening substrate irregularities. Large-scale (100 cm2), highly conductive (≥2500 S m−1) and homogeneous surface areas are engraved single-step in ambient atmosphere with a conventional CO2 laser, even on very thin (∼450 µm) wood veneers. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by turning wood into highly durable strain sensors, flexible electrodes, capacitive touch panels and an electroluminescent LIG-based device.","Ecologically friendly wood electronics will help alleviating the shortcomings of state-of-art cellulose-based green electronics.

1771,Molecular mechanics underlying flat-to-round membrane budding in live secretory cells,"Membrane budding entails forces to transform flat membrane into vesicles essential for cell survival. Accumulated studies have identified coat-proteins (e.g., clathrin) as potential budding factors. However, forces mediating many non-coated membrane buddings remain unclear. By visualizing proteins in mediating endocytic budding in live neuroendocrine cells, performing in vitro protein reconstitution and physical modeling, we discovered how non-coated-membrane budding is mediated: actin filaments and dynamin generate a pulling force transforming flat membrane into Λ-shape; subsequently, dynamin helices surround and constrict Λ-profile’s base, transforming Λ- to Ω-profile, and then constrict Ω-profile’s pore, converting Ω-profiles to vesicles. These mechanisms control budding speed, vesicle size and number, generating diverse endocytic modes differing in these parameters. Their impact is widespread beyond secretory cells, as the unexpectedly powerful functions of dynamin and actin, previously thought to mediate fission and overcome tension, respectively, may contribute to many dynamin/actin-dependent non-coated-membrane buddings, coated-membrane buddings, and other membrane remodeling processes.","Shin et al. report the molecular mechanics of membrane budding: actin and dynamin pull membrane inward to form a Λ-shape profile; dynamin helices convert Λ- to Ω-shape by constricting Λ’s base, and then constrict Ω-profile’s pore to form a vesicle.",2022-06-27
1772,Hydroxyl radicals dominate reoxidation of oxide-derived Cu in electrochemical CO2 reduction,"Cuδ+ sites on the surface of oxide-derived copper (OD-Cu) are of vital importance in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the underlying reason for the dynamically existing Cuδ+ species, although thermodynamically unstable under reductive CO2RR conditions, remains uncovered. Here, by using electron paramagnetic resonance, we identify the highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals (OH•) formed at room temperature in HCO3- solutions. In combination with in situ Raman spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and isotope-labelling, we demonstrate a dynamic reduction/reoxidation behavior at the surface of OD-Cu and reveal that the fast oxygen exchange between HCO3- and H2O provides oxygen sources for the formation of OH• radicals. In addition, their continuous generations can cause spontaneous oxidation of Cu electrodes and produce surface CuOx species. Significantly, this work suggests that there is a “seesaw-effect” between the cathodic reduction and the OH•-induced reoxidation, determining the chemical state and content of Cuδ+ species in CO2RR. This insight is supposed to thrust an understanding of the crucial role of electrolytes in CO2RR.",The Cuδ+ species has been frequently detected during CO2 reduction and plays a key role in C-C coupling for C2+ products. Here the authors uncover that the HCO3- solution can activate hydroxyl radicals that oxidize metallic Cu to surface Cuδ+ species.,2022-06-27
1773,21st-century stagnation in unvegetated sand-sea activity,"Sand seas are vast expanses of Earth’s surface containing large areas of aeolian dunes—topographic patterns manifest from above-threshold winds and a supply of loose sand. Predictions of the role of future climate change for sand-sea activity are sparse and contradictory. Here we examine the impact of climate on all of Earth’s presently-unvegetated sand seas, using ensemble runs of an Earth System Model for historical and future Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. We find that almost all of the sand seas decrease in activity relative to present-day and industrial-onset for all future SSP scenarios, largely due to more intermittent sand-transport events. An increase in event wait-times and decrease in sand transport is conducive to vegetation growth. We expect dune-forming winds will become more unimodal, and produce larger incipient wavelengths, due to weaker and more seasonal winds. Our results indicate that these qualitative changes in Earth’s deserts cannot be mitigated.","Earth’s largest dune fields are set to become less dynamic on average over this century due to anthropogenic climate change, with no future action able to mitigate this effect, as predicted by the newest iteration of CMIP models.",2022-06-27
1774,Cancer cells dying from ferroptosis impede dendritic cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity,"Immunogenic cell death significantly contributes to the success of anti-cancer therapies, but immunogenicity of different cell death modalities widely varies. Ferroptosis, a form of cell death that is characterized by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, has not yet been fully evaluated from this perspective. Here we present an inducible model of ferroptosis, distinguishing three phases in the process—‘initial’ associated with lipid peroxidation, ‘intermediate’ correlated with ATP release and ‘terminal’ recognized by HMGB1 release and loss of plasma membrane integrity—that serves as tool to study immune cell responses to ferroptotic cancer cells. Co-culturing ferroptotic cancer cells with dendritic cells (DC), reveals that ‘initial’ ferroptotic cells decrease maturation of DC, are poorly engulfed, and dampen antigen cross-presentation. DC loaded with ferroptotic, in contrast to necroptotic, cancer cells fail to protect against tumor growth. Adding ferroptotic cancer cells to immunogenic apoptotic cells dramatically reduces their prophylactic vaccination potential. Our study thus shows that ferroptosis negatively impacts antigen presenting cells and hence the adaptive immune response, which might hinder therapeutic applications of ferroptosis induction.","Inducing ferroptosis of tumour cells is a promising therapeutic approach in cancer. Authors show here that on the other hand, cells dying via ferroptosis are less immunogenic than necroptotic cells, they inhibit maturation and antigen cross-presentation of dendritic cells, hence lessen the anti-tumour immune response.",2022-06-27
1775,Context-aware deconvolution of cell–cell communication with Tensor-cell2cell,"Cell interactions determine phenotypes, and intercellular communication is shaped by cellular contexts such as disease state, organismal life stage, and tissue microenvironment. Single-cell technologies measure the molecules mediating cell–cell communication, and emerging computational tools can exploit these data to decipher intercellular communication. However, current methods either disregard cellular context or rely on simple pairwise comparisons between samples, thus limiting the ability to decipher complex cell–cell communication across multiple time points, levels of disease severity, or spatial contexts. Here we present Tensor-cell2cell, an unsupervised method using tensor decomposition, which deciphers context-driven intercellular communication by simultaneously accounting for multiple stages, states, or locations of the cells. To do so, Tensor-cell2cell uncovers context-driven patterns of communication associated with different phenotypic states and determined by unique combinations of cell types and ligand-receptor pairs. As such, Tensor-cell2cell robustly improves upon and extends the analytical capabilities of existing tools. We show Tensor-cell2cell can identify multiple modules associated with distinct communication processes (e.g., participating cell–cell and ligand-receptor pairs) linked to severities of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and to Autism Spectrum Disorder. Thus, we introduce an effective and easy-to-use strategy for understanding complex communication patterns across diverse conditions.","Cellular contexts such as disease state, organismal life stage and tissue microenvironment, shape intercellular communication, and ultimately affect an organism’s phenotypes. Here, the authors present Tensor-cell2cell, an unsupervised method for deciphering context-driven intercellular communication.",2022-06-27
1776,Warming-induced increase in carbon uptake is linked to earlier spring phenology in temperate and boreal forests,"Under global warming, advances in spring phenology due to rising temperatures have been widely reported. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying the advancement in spring phenology still remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of temperature during the previous growing season on spring phenology of current year based on the start of season extracted from multiple long-term and large-scale phenological datasets between 1951 and 2018. Our findings indicate that warmer temperatures during previous growing season are linked to earlier spring phenology of current year in temperate and boreal forests. Correspondingly, we observed an earlier spring phenology with the increase in photosynthesis of the previous growing season. These findings suggest that the observed warming-induced earlier spring phenology is driven by increased photosynthetic carbon assimilation in the previous growing season. Therefore, the vital role of warming-induced changes in carbon assimilation should be considered to accurately project spring phenology and carbon cycling in forest ecosystems under future climate warming.","The mechanisms underlying plant phenological shifts are debated. Here, based on phenological observations and ecosystem flux and climate data, Gu and colleagues provide evidence that warming-enhanced photosynthesis in a growing season contributes to earlier spring phenology in the following year in temperate and boreal forests.",2022-06-27
1777,"A GPCR-based yeast biosensor for biomedical, biotechnological, and point-of-use cannabinoid determination","Eukaryotic cells use G-protein coupled receptors to sense diverse signals, ranging from chemical compounds to light. Here, we exploit the remarkable sensing capacity of G-protein coupled receptors to construct yeast-based biosensors for real-life applications. To establish proof-of-concept, we focus on cannabinoids because of their neuromodulatory and immunomodulatory activities. We construct a CB2 receptor-based biosensor, optimize it to achieve high sensitivity and dynamic range, and prove its effectiveness in three applications of increasing difficulty. First, we screen a compound library to discover agonists and antagonists. Second, we analyze 54 plants to discover a new phytocannabinoid, dugesialactone. Finally, we develop a robust portable device, analyze body-fluid samples, and confidently detect designer drugs like JWH-018. These examples demonstrate the potential of yeast-based biosensors to enable diverse applications that can be implemented by non-specialists. Taking advantage of the extensive sensing repertoire of G-protein coupled receptors, this technology can be extended to detect numerous compounds.","GPCRs are used for diverse sensing in eukaryotes. Here the authors use GPCRs to construct yeast-based biosensors, focussing on cannabinoids, and use these to screen agonists and antagonists, as well as generate a portable detection device.",2022-06-27
1778,Poor outcome of pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia harboring high FLT3/ITD allelic ratios,"Activating FLT3 mutations are the most common mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the optimal threshold of FLT3/ITD allelic ratio (AR) among pediatric AML patients remains controversial. Here, we present the outcome and prognostic significance of FLT3/ITD AR analysis among pediatric patients with AML from the TARGET dataset. Applying fitting curve models and threshold effect analysis using the restrictive cubic spline function following Cox proportional hazards models identifies the cut-off value of 0.5 on FLT3/ITD AR. Moreover, we observe that high FLT3/ITD AR patients have an inferior outcome when compared to low AR patients. Our study also demonstrates that stem cell transplantation may improve the outcome in pediatric AML patients with high FLT3/ITD AR and may be further improved when combined with additional therapies such as Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin. These findings underline the importance of individualized treatment of pediatric AML.","Activating FLT3 mutations are the most common mutations in AML. Here, the authors explore the relationship between the FLT3/ITD allelic ratio and prognosis in pediatric AML patients and identify an optimal threshold to stratify patients.",2022-06-27
1779,Recovery of neural dynamics criticality in personalized whole-brain models of stroke,"The critical brain hypothesis states that biological neuronal networks, because of their structural and functional architecture, work near phase transitions for optimal response to internal and external inputs. Criticality thus provides optimal function and behavioral capabilities. We test this hypothesis by examining the influence of brain injury (strokes) on the criticality of neural dynamics estimated at the level of single participants using directly measured individual structural connectomes and whole-brain models. Lesions engender a sub-critical state that recovers over time in parallel with behavior. The improvement of criticality is associated with the re-modeling of specific white-matter connections. We show that personalized whole-brain dynamical models poised at criticality track neural dynamics, alteration post-stroke, and behavior at the level of single participants.",The authors investigate the influence of brain injury (strokes) on the criticality of neural dynamics using directly measured connectomes and whole-brain models. They show that lesions engender a sub-critical state that recovers over time in parallel with behavior.,2022-06-27
1780,"GenomicSuperSignature facilitates interpretation of RNA-seq experiments through robust, efficient comparison to public databases","Millions of transcriptomic profiles have been deposited in public archives, yet remain underused for the interpretation of new experiments. We present a method for interpreting new transcriptomic datasets through instant comparison to public datasets without high-performance computing requirements. We apply Principal Component Analysis on 536 studies comprising 44,890 human RNA sequencing profiles and aggregate sufficiently similar loading vectors to form Replicable Axes of Variation (RAV). RAVs are annotated with metadata of originating studies and by gene set enrichment analysis. Functionality to associate new datasets with RAVs, extract interpretable annotations, and provide intuitive visualization are implemented as the GenomicSuperSignature R/Bioconductor package. We demonstrate the efficient and coherent database search, robustness to batch effects and heterogeneous training data, and transfer learning capacity of our method using TCGA and rare diseases datasets. GenomicSuperSignature aids in analyzing new gene expression data in the context of existing databases using minimal computing resources.","Many transcriptomic profiles have been deposited in public archives but are underused for the interpretation of experiments.

1781,POLYRETINA restores light responses in vivo in blind Göttingen minipigs,"Retinal prostheses hold the potential for artificial vision in blind people affected by incurable diseases of the outer retinal layer. Available technologies provide only a small field of view: a significant limitation for totally blind people. To overcome this problem, we recently proposed a large and high-density photovoltaic epiretinal device, known as POLYRETINA. Here, we report the in vivo assessment of POLYRETINA. First, we characterise a model of chemically-induced blindness in Göttingen minipigs. Then, we develop and test a minimally invasive injection procedure to insert the large epiretinal implant into the eye. Last, we show that POLYRETINA restores light-evoked cortical responses in blind animals at safe irradiance levels. These results indicate that POLYRETINA holds the potential for artificial vision in totally blind patients affected by retinitis pigmentosa.","Retinal prostheses hold potential for artificial vision in blind people.

1782,Shape-assisted self-assembly,"Self-assembly and molecular recognition are critical processes both in life and material sciences. They usually depend on strong, directional non-covalent interactions to gain specificity and to make long-range organization possible. Most supramolecular constructs are also at least partially governed by topography, whose role is hard to disentangle. This makes it nearly impossible to discern the potential of shape and motion in the creation of complexity. Here, we demonstrate that long-range order in supramolecular constructs can be assisted by the topography of the individual units even in the absence of highly directional interactions. Molecular units of remarkable simplicity self-assemble in solution to give single-molecule thin two-dimensional supramolecular polymers of defined boundaries. This dramatic example spotlights the critical function that topography can have in molecular assembly and paves the path to rationally designed systems of increasing sophistication.","Self-assembly and molecular recognition usually depend on strong, directional non-covalent interactions but also topography can play a role in the formation of supramolecular constructs which makes it nearly impossible to discern the potential of shape and motion in the creation of complexity.

1783,Quasi-solid-state Zn-air batteries with an atomically dispersed cobalt electrocatalyst and organohydrogel electrolyte,"Quasi-solid-state Zn-air batteries are usually limited to relatively low-rate ability (<10 mA cm−2), which is caused in part by sluggish oxygen electrocatalysis and unstable electrochemical interfaces. Here we present a high-rate and robust quasi-solid-state Zn-air battery enabled by atomically dispersed cobalt sites anchored on wrinkled nitrogen doped graphene as the air cathode and a polyacrylamide organohydrogel electrolyte with its hydrogen-bond network modified by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide. This design enables a cycling current density of 100 mA cm−2 over 50 h at 25 °C. A low-temperature cycling stability of over 300 h (at 0.5 mA cm−2) with over 90% capacity retention at −60 °C and a broad temperature adaptability (−60 to 60 °C) are also demonstrated.","Quasi-solid-state Zn-air batteries are limited by sluggish kinetics and low temperature incompatibility.

1784,Safety and immunogenicity of a hybrid-type vaccine booster in BBIBP-CorV recipients in a randomized phase 2 trial,"NVSI-06-08 is a potential broad-spectrum recombinant COVID-19 vaccine that integrates the antigens from multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains into a single immunogen. Here, we evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of NVSI-06-08 as a heterologous booster dose in BBIBP-CorV recipients in a randomized, double-blind, controlled, phase 2 trial conducted in the United Arab Emirates (NCT05069129). Three groups of healthy adults over 18 years of age (600 participants per group) who have administered two doses of BBIBP-CorV 4-6-month, 7-9-month and >9-month earlier, respectively, are randomized 1:1 to receive either a homologous booster of BBIBP-CorV or a heterologous booster of NVSI-06-08. The incidence of adverse reactions is low, and the overall safety profile is quite similar between two booster regimens. Both Neutralizing and IgG antibodies elicited by NVSI-06-08 booster are significantly higher than those by BBIBP-CorV booster against not only SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain but also multiple variants of concerns (VOCs). Especially, the neutralizing antibody GMT against Omicron variant induced by heterologous NVSI-06-08 booster reaches 367.67, which is substantially greater than that boosted by BBIBP-CorV (GMT: 45.03). In summary, NVSI-06-08 is safe and immunogenic as a booster dose following two doses of BBIBP-CorV, which is immunogenically superior to the homologous boost with another dose of BBIBP-CorV.","SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune escape capability highlight the need for the development of cross-neutralising vaccines and regimens.

1785,Structural basis for defective membrane targeting of mutant enzyme in human VLCAD deficiency,"Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) is an inner mitochondrial membrane enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of long-chain fatty acid oxidation. Point mutations in human VLCAD can produce an inborn error of metabolism called VLCAD deficiency that can lead to severe pathophysiologic consequences, including cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia, and rhabdomyolysis. Discrete mutations in a structurally-uncharacterized C-terminal domain region of VLCAD cause enzymatic deficiency by an incompletely defined mechanism. Here, we conducted a structure-function study, incorporating X-ray crystallography, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, computational modeling, and biochemical analyses, to characterize a specific membrane interaction defect of full-length, human VLCAD bearing the clinically-observed mutations, A450P or L462P. By disrupting a predicted α-helical hairpin, these mutations either partially or completely impair direct interaction with the membrane itself. Thus, our data support a structural basis for VLCAD deficiency in patients with discrete mutations in an α-helical membrane-binding motif, resulting in pathologic enzyme mislocalization.","Prew et al. uncovered a structural basis for human VLCAD deficiency that arises from point mutations within the enzyme’s membrane-binding region, which was shown to fold as a putative α-helical hairpin.

1786,Sharing the effort of the European Green Deal among countries,"In implementing the European Green Deal to align with the Paris Agreement, the EU has raised its climate ambition and in 2022 is negotiating the distribution of increased mitigation effort among Member States. Such partitioning of targets among subsidiary entities is becoming a major challenge for implementation of climate policies around the globe. We contrast the 2021 European Commission proposal - an allocation based on a singular country attribute - with transparent and reproducible methods based on three ethical principles. We go beyond traditional effort-sharing literature and explore allocations representing an aggregated least regret compromise between different EU country perspectives on a fair allocation. While the 2021 proposal represents a nuanced compromise for many countries, for others a further redistribution could be considered equitable. Whereas we apply our approach within the setting of the EU negotiations, the framework can easily be adapted to inform debates worldwide on sharing mitigation effort among subsidiary entities.","An ethically-based method for allocating climate change mitigation effort among subsidiaries, applicable worldwide, is proposed. Applied to the EU Green Deal, this results in a wider range of targets than the Commission’s proposal of 2021.",2022-06-27
1787,Frequency and mechanisms of LINE-1 retrotransposon insertions at CRISPR/Cas9 sites,"CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing has revolutionized experimental molecular biology and entered the clinical world for targeted gene therapy. Identifying DNA modifications occurring at CRISPR/Cas9 target sites is critical to determine efficiency and safety of editing tools. Here we show that insertions of LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons can occur frequently at CRISPR/Cas9 editing sites. Together with PolyA-seq and an improved amplicon sequencing, we characterize more than 2500 de novo L1 insertions at multiple CRISPR/Cas9 editing sites in HEK293T, HeLa and U2OS cells. These L1 retrotransposition events exploit CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSB formation and require L1 RT activity. Importantly, de novo L1 insertions are rare during genome editing by prime editors (PE), cytidine or adenine base editors (CBE or ABE), consistent with their reduced DSB formation. These data demonstrate that insertions of retrotransposons might be a potential outcome of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and provide further evidence on the safety of different CRISPR-based editing tools.","The identification of events occurring at target sites is critical to determine the safety of CRISPRbased DNA editing tools. Here, the authors show that LINE-1 retrotranspositions can occur frequently at canonical CRISPR/Cas9 editing sites, but are rare with prime editors and base editors.",2022-06-27
1788,COVID-19 disease severity in US Veterans infected during Omicron and Delta variant predominant periods,"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is thought to cause less severe disease among the general population, but disease severity among at-risk populations is unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis using a matched cohort of United States veterans to compare the disease severity of subjects infected during Omicron and Delta predominant periods within 14 days of initial diagnosis. We identified 22,841 matched pairs for both periods. During the Omicron period, 20,681 (90.5%) veterans had mild, 1308 (5.7%) moderate, and 852 (3.7%) severe disease. During the Delta predominant period, 19,356 (84.7%) had mild, 1467 (6.4%) moderate, and 2018 (8.8%) severe disease. Moderate or severe disease was less likely during the Omicron period and more common among older subjects and those with more comorbidities. Here we show that infection with the Omicron variant is associated with less severe disease than the Delta variant in a high-risk older veteran population, and vaccinations provide protection against severe or critical disease.",Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant appears to cause milder disease in the general population than infection with Delta. Here the authors use data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs and demonstrate that this also applies to infection in an at-risk population of older age and with more co-morbidities.,2022-06-25
1789,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 intra-host recombination during superinfection with Alpha and Epsilon variants in New York City,"Recombination is an evolutionary process by which many pathogens generate diversity and acquire novel functions. Although a common occurrence during coronavirus replication, detection of recombination is only feasible when genetically distinct viruses contemporaneously infect the same host. Here, we identify an instance of SARS-CoV-2 superinfection, whereby an individual was infected with two distinct viral variants: Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Epsilon (B.1.429). This superinfection was first noted when an Alpha genome sequence failed to exhibit the classic S gene target failure behavior used to track this variant. Full genome sequencing from four independent extracts reveals that Alpha variant alleles comprise around 75% of the genomes, whereas the Epsilon variant alleles comprise around 20% of the sample. Further investigation reveals the presence of numerous recombinant haplotypes spanning the genome, specifically in the spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF 8 coding regions. These findings support the potential for recombination to reshape SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity.","Here, the authors characterize a case of SARS-CoV-2 superinfection with Alpha and Epsilon variants, in which, via full genome sequencing analyses, they identify recombinant haplotypes in the spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF 8 coding regions, suggesting recombination could play a role in SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity.",2022-06-25
1790,Echolocation-related reversal of information flow in a cortical vocalization network,"The mammalian frontal and auditory cortices are important for vocal behavior. Here, using local-field potential recordings, we demonstrate that the timing and spatial patterns of oscillations in the fronto-auditory network of vocalizing bats (Carollia perspicillata) predict the purpose of vocalization: echolocation or communication. Transfer entropy analyses revealed predominant top-down (frontal-to-auditory cortex) information flow during spontaneous activity and pre-vocal periods. The dynamics of information flow depend on the behavioral role of the vocalization and on the timing relative to vocal onset. We observed the emergence of predominant bottom-up (auditory-to-frontal) information transfer during the post-vocal period specific to echolocation pulse emission, leading to self-directed acoustic feedback. Electrical stimulation of frontal areas selectively enhanced responses to sounds in auditory cortex. These results reveal unique changes in information flow across sensory and frontal cortices, potentially driven by the purpose of the vocalization in a highly vocal mammalian model.","How cortical areas interact during vocalization is not fully understood. Here the authors show that when bats vocalize, the behavioral function of emitted sounds determines the direction of information flow between frontal and auditory cortices.",2022-06-25
1791,FANCM promotes class I interfering crossovers and suppresses class II non-interfering crossovers in wheat meiosis,"FANCM suppresses crossovers in plants by unwinding recombination intermediates. In wheat, crossovers are skewed toward the chromosome ends, thus limiting generation of novel allelic combinations. Here, we observe that FANCM maintains the obligate crossover in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, thus ensuring that every chromosome pair exhibits at least one crossover, by localizing class I crossover protein HEI10 at pachytene. FANCM also suppresses class II crossovers that increased 2.6-fold in fancm msh5 quadruple mutants. These data are consistent with a role for FANCM in second-end capture of class I designated crossover sites, whilst FANCM is also required to promote formation of non-crossovers. In hexaploid wheat, genetic mapping reveals that crossovers increase by 31% in fancm compared to wild type, indicating that fancm could be an effective tool to accelerate breeding. Crossover rate differences in fancm correlate with wild type crossover distributions, suggesting that chromatin may influence the recombination landscape in similar ways in both wild type and fancm.","The FANCM helicase functions in limiting crossovers (COs) by unwinding inter-homolog repair intermediates. Here, the authors generate null mutants of fancm in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat and show that FANCM promotes class I interfering COs and suppresses class II noninterfering COs in wheat meiosis.",2022-06-25
1792,Environmental trade-offs of direct air capture technologies in climate change mitigation toward 2100,"Direct air capture (DAC) is critical for achieving stringent climate targets, yet the environmental implications of its large-scale deployment have not been evaluated in this context. Performing a prospective life cycle assessment for two promising technologies in a series of climate change mitigation scenarios, we find that electricity sector decarbonization and DAC technology improvements are both indispensable to avoid environmental problem-shifting. Decarbonizing the electricity sector improves the sequestration efficiency, but also increases the terrestrial ecotoxicity and metal depletion levels per tonne of CO2 sequestered via DAC. These increases can be reduced by improvements in DAC material and energy use efficiencies. DAC exhibits regional environmental impact variations, highlighting the importance of smart siting related to energy system planning and integration. DAC deployment aids the achievement of long-term climate targets, its environmental and climate performance however depend on sectoral mitigation actions, and thus should not suggest a relaxation of sectoral decarbonization targets.","New study concludes that environmental tradeoffs of direct air capture and sequestration technologies are linked to the energy system in which they will operate, and their deployment should not equate to a relaxation of decarbonization or resource use efficiency targets.",2022-06-25
1793,Existing function in primary visual cortex is not perturbed by new skill acquisition of a non-matched sensory task,"Acquisition of new skills has the potential to disturb existing network function. To directly assess whether previously acquired cortical function is altered during learning, mice were trained in an abstract task in which selected activity patterns were rewarded using an optical brain-computer interface device coupled to primary visual cortex (V1) neurons. Excitatory neurons were longitudinally recorded using 2-photon calcium imaging. Despite significant changes in local neural activity during task performance, tuning properties and stimulus encoding assessed outside of the trained context were not perturbed. Similarly, stimulus tuning was stable in neurons that remained responsive following a different, visual discrimination training task. However, visual discrimination training increased the rate of representational drift. Our results indicate that while some forms of perceptual learning may modify the contribution of individual neurons to stimulus encoding, new skill learning is not inherently disruptive to the quality of stimulus representation in adult V1.","Using an optical brain computer interface in mice, here the authors demonstrate that new skill acquisition is not inherently disruptive to existing function. These findings suggest neural networks are robust to perturbations associated with integrating new information.",2022-06-25
1794,Identification and characterization of a new ensemble of cometary organic molecules,"In-situ study of comet 1P/Halley during its 1986 apparition revealed a surprising abundance of organic coma species. It remained unclear, whether or not these species originated from polymeric matter. Now, high-resolution mass-spectrometric data collected at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by ESA’s Rosetta mission unveil the chemical structure of complex cometary organics. Here, we identify an ensemble of individual molecules with masses up to 140 Da while demonstrating inconsistency of the data with relevant amounts of polymeric matter. The ensemble has an average composition of C1H1.56O0.134N0.046S0.017, identical to meteoritic soluble organic matter, and includes a plethora of chain-based, cyclic, and aromatic hydrocarbons at an approximate ratio of 6:3:1. Its compositional and structural properties, except for the H/C ratio, resemble those of other Solar System reservoirs of organics—from organic material in the Saturnian ring rain to meteoritic soluble and insoluble organic matter –, which is compatible with a shared prestellar history.","A new analysis of Rosetta mass spectra reveals an ensemble of complex organic molecules with striking similarities to other organic reservoirs in the Solar System, including Saturn’s ring rain material, pointing at a likely joint prestellar history.",2022-06-25
1795,Microtubule disassembly by caspases is an important rate-limiting step of cell extrusion,"The expulsion of dying epithelial cells requires well-orchestrated remodelling steps to maintain tissue sealing. This process, named cell extrusion, has been mostly analysed through the study of actomyosin regulation. Yet, the mechanistic relationship between caspase activation and cell extrusion is still poorly understood. Using the Drosophila pupal notum, a single layer epithelium where extrusions are caspase-dependent, we showed that the initiation of cell extrusion and apical constriction are surprisingly not associated with the modulation of actomyosin concentration and dynamics. Instead, cell apical constriction is initiated by the disassembly of a medio-apical mesh of microtubules which is driven by effector caspases. Importantly, the depletion of microtubules is sufficient to bypass the requirement of caspases for cell extrusion, while microtubule stabilisation strongly impairs cell extrusion. This study shows that microtubules disassembly by caspases is a key rate-limiting step of extrusion, and outlines a more general function of microtubules in epithelial cell shape stabilisation.","Using the Drosophila pupal notum, the authors demonstrate that the disassembly of microtubules by effector caspases initiate cell extrusion independently of actomyosin regulation, thus providing insights into how caspases orchestrate dying epithelial cell expulsion.",2022-06-25
1796,Defect-induced monopole injection and manipulation in artificial spin ice,"Lithographically defined arrays of nanomagnets are well placed for application in areas such as probabilistic computing or reconfigurable magnonics due to their emergent collective dynamics and writable magnetic order. Among them are artificial spin ice (ASI), which are arrays of binary in-plane macrospins exhibiting geometric frustration at the vertex interfaces. Macrospin flips in the arrays create topologically protected magnetic charges, or emergent monopoles, which are bound to an antimonopole to conserve charge. In the absence of controllable pinning, it is difficult to manipulate individual monopoles in the array without also influencing other monopole excitations or the counter-monopole charge. Here, we tailor the local magnetic order of a classic ASI lattice by introducing a ferromagnetic defect with shape anisotropy into the array. This creates monopole injection sites at nucleation fields below the critical lattice switching field. Once formed, the high energy monopoles are fixed to the defect site and may controllably propagate through the lattice under stimulation. Defect programing of bound monopoles within the array allows fine control of the pathways of inverted macrospins. Such control is a necessary prerequisite for the realization of functional devices, e. g. reconfigurable waveguide in nanomagnonic applications.","Artificial spin ice systems offer a promising platform to study the motion of emergent magnetic monopoles, but controlled nucleation of monopoles is challenging. Here the authors demonstrate controlled injection and propagation of emergent monopoles in an artificial spin ice utilizing ferromagnetic defects.",2022-06-25
1797,Self-sustained electricity generator driven by the compatible integration of ambient moisture adsorption and evaporation,"Generating sustainable electricity from ambient humidity and natural evaporation has attracted tremendous interest recently as it requires no extra mechanical energy input and is deployable across all weather and geography conditions. Here, we present a device prototype for enhanced power generation from ambient humidity. This prototype uses both heterogenous materials assembled from a LiCl-loaded cellulon paper to facilitate moisture adsorption and a carbon-black-loaded cellulon paper to promote water evaporation. Exposing such a centimeter-sized device to ambient humidity can produce voltages of around 0.78 V and a current of around 7.5 μA, both of which can be sustained for more than 10 days. The enhanced electric output and durability are due to the continuous water flow that is directed by evaporation through numerous, negatively charged channels within the cellulon papers. The voltage and current exhibit an excellent scaling behavior upon device integration to sufficiently power commercial devices including even cell phones. The results open a promising prospect of sustainable electricity generation based on a synergy between spontaneous moisture adsorption and water evaporation.","Generating electricity from air opens a promising way for green energy harvesting. Here, authors present a prototype driven by the integration of moisture adsorption with evaporation to generate continuous electricity for a long duration.",2022-06-25
1798,The ω3 scaling of the vibrational density of states in quasi-2D nanoconfined solids,"The vibrational properties of crystalline bulk materials are well described by Debye theory, which successfully predicts the quadratic ω2 low-frequency scaling of the vibrational density of states. However, the analogous framework for nanoconfined materials with fewer degrees of freedom has been far less well explored. Using inelastic neutron scattering, we characterize the vibrational density of states of amorphous ice confined inside graphene oxide membranes and we observe a crossover from the Debye ω2 scaling to an anomalous ω3 behaviour upon reducing the confinement size L. Additionally, using molecular dynamics simulations, we confirm the experimental findings and prove that such a scaling appears in both crystalline and amorphous solids under slab-confinement. We theoretically demonstrate that this low-frequency ω3 law results from the geometric constraints on the momentum phase space induced by confinement along one spatial direction. Finally, we predict that the Debye scaling reappears at a characteristic frequency ω× = vL/2π, with v the speed of sound of the material, and we confirm this quantitative estimate with simulations.","A description of the vibrational properties of amorphous ice confined in graphene oxide membranes, as an exemplary nanoconfined material, is presented. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations show anomalous deviations from standard bulk behavior.",2022-06-25
1799,Ru(II) photocages enable precise control over enzyme activity with red light,"The cytochrome P450 family of enzymes (CYPs) are important targets for medicinal chemistry. Recently, CYP1B1 has emerged as a key player in chemotherapy resistance in the treatment of cancer. This enzyme is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, and is correlated with poor treatment outcomes; thus, it is desirable to develop CYP1B1 inhibitors to restore chemotherapy efficacy. However, possible off-target effects, such as inhibition of liver CYPs responsible for first pass metabolism, make selective inhibition a high priority to avoid possible drug-drug interactions and toxicity. Here we describe the creation of light-triggered CYP1B1 inhibitors as “prodrugs”, and achieve >6000-fold improvement in potency upon activation with low energy (660 nm) light. These systems provide a selectivity index of 4,000–100,000 over other off-target CYPs. One key to the design was the development of coordinating CYP1B1 inhibitors, which suppress enzyme activity at pM concentrations in live cells. The metal binding group enforces inhibitor orientation in the active site by anchoring to the iron. The second essential component was the biologically compatible Ru(II) scaffold that cages the inhibitors before photochemical release. These Ru(II) photocages are anticipated to provide similar selectivity and control for any coordinating CYP inhibitors.","The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP1B1 is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, and is correlated with poor treatment outcomes; thus, it is desirable to develop CYP1B1 inhibitors to restore chemotherapy efficacy.

1800,Emergent properties as by-products of prebiotic evolution of aminoacylation ribozymes,"Systems of catalytic RNAs presumably gave rise to important evolutionary innovations, such as the genetic code. Such systems may exhibit particular tolerance to errors (error minimization) as well as coding specificity. While often assumed to result from natural selection, error minimization may instead be an emergent by-product. In an RNA world, a system of self-aminoacylating ribozymes could enforce the mapping of amino acids to anticodons. We measured the activity of thousands of ribozyme mutants on alternative substrates (activated analogs for tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, and methionine). Related ribozymes exhibited shared preferences for substrates, indicating that adoption of additional amino acids by existing ribozymes would itself lead to error minimization. Furthermore, ribozyme activity was positively correlated with specificity, indicating that selection for increased activity would also lead to increased specificity. These results demonstrate that by-products of ribozyme evolution could lead to adaptive value in specificity and error tolerance.","Complex biochemical systems exhibit traits that appear to be highly adapted. Studies of catalytic RNA demonstrate that adaptive traits, such as increased specificity and error tolerance, could originate as evolutionary by-products.",2022-06-25
1801,Mucin induces CRISPR-Cas defense in an opportunistic pathogen,"Parasitism by bacteriophages has led to the evolution of a variety of defense mechanisms in their host bacteria. However, it is unclear what factors lead to specific defenses being deployed upon phage infection. To explore this question, we co-evolved the bacterial fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare and its virulent phage V156 in presence and absence of a eukaryotic host signal (mucin) for sixteen weeks. The presence of mucin leads to a dramatic increase in CRISPR spacer acquisition, especially in low nutrient conditions where over 60% of colonies obtain at least one new spacer. Additionally, we show that the presence of a competitor bacterium further increases CRISPR spacer acquisition in F. columnare. These results suggest that ecological factors are important in determining defense strategies against phages, and that the phage-bacterium interactions on mucosal surfaces may select for the diversification of bacterial immune systems.","It is unknown what circumstances promote particular bacterial defenses against bacterial viruses (phages). Almeida & Hoikkala et al. show that mucin, derived from mucus, greatly accelerates CRISPR-Cas defenses against phage in an opportunistic pathogen.",2022-06-25
1802,Spin relaxation in a single-electron graphene quantum dot,"The relaxation time of a single-electron spin is an important parameter for solid-state spin qubits, as it directly limits the lifetime of the encoded information. Thanks to the low spin-orbit interaction and low hyperfine coupling, graphene and bilayer graphene (BLG) have long been considered promising platforms for spin qubits. Only recently, it has become possible to control single-electrons in BLG quantum dots (QDs) and to understand their spin-valley texture, while the relaxation dynamics have remained mostly unexplored. Here, we report spin relaxation times (T1) of single-electron states in BLG QDs. Using pulsed-gate spectroscopy, we extract relaxation times exceeding 200 μs at a magnetic field of 1.9 T. The T1 values show a strong dependence on the spin splitting, promising even longer T1 at lower magnetic fields, where our measurements are limited by the signal-to-noise ratio. The relaxation times are more than two orders of magnitude larger than those previously reported for carbon-based QDs, suggesting that graphene is a potentially promising host material for scalable spin qubits.","Graphene has long been considered to be a promising host for spin qubits, however a demonstration of long spin relaxation times for a potential qubit has been lacking. Here, the authors report the electrical measurement of the single-electron spin relaxation time exceeding 200 μs in a bilayer graphene quantum dot.",2022-06-25
1803,The force required to remove tubulin from the microtubule lattice by pulling on its α-tubulin C-terminal tail,"Severing enzymes and molecular motors extract tubulin from the walls of microtubules by exerting mechanical force on subunits buried in the lattice. However, how much force is needed to remove tubulin from microtubules is not known, nor is the pathway by which subunits are removed. Using a site-specific functionalization method, we applied forces to the C-terminus of α-tubulin with an optical tweezer and found that a force of ~30 pN is required to extract tubulin from the microtubule wall. Additionally, we discovered that partial unfolding is an intermediate step in tubulin removal. The unfolding and extraction forces are similar to those generated by AAA-unfoldases. Lastly, we show that three kinesin-1 motor proteins can also extract tubulin from the microtubule lattice. Our results provide the first experimental investigation of how tubulin responds to mechanical forces exerted on its α-tubulin C-terminal tail and have implications for the mechanisms of severing enzymes and microtubule stability.","Tubulin, the building blocks of microtubules, can be removed from the microtubule wall by mechanical forces. Using single-molecule methods, the authors show that tubulin partially unfolds prior to its removal and determined the tubulin-extraction force.",2022-06-25
1804,Structural mechanism of protein recognition by the FW domain of autophagy receptor Nbr1,"Neighbor of BRCA1 (Nbr1) is a conserved autophagy receptor that provides cargo selectivity to autophagy. The four-tryptophan (FW) domain is a signature domain of Nbr1, but its exact function remains unclear. Here, we show that Nbr1 from the filamentous fungus Chaetomium thermophilum uses its FW domain to bind the α-mannosidase Ams1, a cargo of selective autophagy in both budding yeast and fission yeast, and delivers Ams1 to the vacuole by conventional autophagy in heterologous fission yeast. The structure of the Ams1-FW complex was determined at 2.2 Å resolution by cryo-electron microscopy. The FW domain adopts an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich structure and recognizes the quaternary structure of the Ams1 tetramer. Notably, the N-terminal di-glycine of Ams1 is specifically recognized by a conserved pocket of the FW domain. The FW domain becomes degenerated in fission yeast Nbr1, which binds Ams1 with a ZZ domain instead. Our findings illustrate the protein binding mode of the FW domain and reveal the versatility of Nbr1-mediated cargo recognition.","Nbr1 recognizes cargos in selective autophagy. Here, authors show filamentous yeast Nbr1 binds Ams1 via an FW domain, and the cryo-EM structure reveals that Nbr1 recognizes the N-terminal di-glycine and tetrameric assembly of Ams1.",2022-06-25
1805,Assembly dynamics of FtsZ and DamX during infection-related filamentation and division in uropathogenic E. coli,"During infection of bladder epithelial cells, uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) can stop dividing and grow into highly filamentous forms. Here, we find that some filaments of E. coli UTI89 released from infected cells grow very rapidly and by more than 100 μm before initiating division, whereas others do not survive, suggesting that infection-related filamentation (IRF) is a stress response that promotes bacterial dispersal. IRF is accompanied by unstable, dynamic repositioning of FtsZ division rings. In contrast, DamX, which is associated with normal cell division and is also essential for IRF, is distributed uniformly around the cell envelope during filamentation. When filaments initiate division to regenerate rod cells, DamX condenses into stable rings prior to division. The DamX rings maintain consistent thickness during constriction and remain at the septum until after membrane fusion. Deletion of damX affects vegetative cell division in UTI89 (but not in the model E. coli K-12), and, during infection, blocks filamentation and reduces bacterial cell integrity. IRF therefore involves DamX distribution throughout the membrane and prevention of FtsZ ring stabilization, leading to cell division arrest. DamX then reassembles into stable division rings for filament division, promoting dispersal and survival during infection.","A subset of uropathogenic Escherichia coli are able to halt division and grow into highly filamentous cells during infection of bladder epithelial cells. Here, authors aim to determine the mechanism, and understand the dynamics of cell division machinery during infection-related filamentation.",2022-06-25
1806,Age and sex-specific risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following Covid-19 messenger RNA vaccines,"Cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following the receipt of Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. As vaccination campaigns are still to be extended, we aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the association, by vaccine and across sex and age groups. Using nationwide hospital discharge and vaccine data, we analysed all 1612 cases of myocarditis and 1613 cases of pericarditis that occurred in France in the period from May 12, 2021 to October 31, 2021. We perform matched case-control studies and find increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis during the first week following vaccination, and particularly after the second dose, with adjusted odds ratios of myocarditis of 8.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to 9.9) for the BNT162b2 and 30 (95% CI, 21 to 43) for the mRNA-1273 vaccine. The largest associations are observed for myocarditis following mRNA-1273 vaccination in persons aged 18 to 24 years. Estimates of excess cases attributable to vaccination also reveal a substantial burden of both myocarditis and pericarditis across other age groups and in both males and females.","There have been reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA COVID-9 vaccination. Here, the authors use nationwide data from France and find increased risks of these outcomes in the first week following vaccination, for both the first and second dose, and present age- and sex-specific rates.",2022-06-25
1807,Occult polyclonality of preclinical pancreatic cancer models drives in vitro evolution,"Heterogeneity is a hallmark of cancer. The advent of single-cell technologies has helped uncover heterogeneity in a high-throughput manner in different cancers across varied contexts. Here we apply single-cell sequencing technologies to reveal inherent heterogeneity in assumptively monoclonal pancreatic cancer (PDAC) cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Our findings reveal a high degree of both genomic and transcriptomic polyclonality in monolayer PDAC cell lines, custodial variation induced by growing apparently identical cell lines in different laboratories, and transcriptomic shifts in transitioning from 2D to 3D spheroid growth models. Our findings also call into question the validity of widely available immortalized, non-transformed pancreatic lines as contemporaneous “control” lines in experiments. We confirm these findings using a variety of independent assays, including but not limited to whole exome sequencing, single-cell copy number variation sequencing (scCNVseq), single-nuclei assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, fluorescence in-situ hybridization, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We map scRNA expression data to unique genomic clones identified by orthogonally-gathered scCNVseq data of these same PDAC cell lines. Further, while PDOs are known to reflect the cognate in vivo biology of the parental tumor, we identify transcriptomic shifts during ex vivo passage that might hamper their predictive abilities over time. The impact of these findings on rigor and reproducibility of experimental data generated using established preclinical PDAC models between and across laboratories is uncertain, but a matter of concern.","It is unclear if the molecular profiles of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) preclinical models remain stable during propagation. Here, the authors characterise clonal evolution throughout propagation in PDAC cell lines and a patient-derived organoid using single-cell genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics.",2022-06-25
1808,Targeting fungal membrane homeostasis with imidazopyrazoindoles impairs azole resistance and biofilm formation,"Fungal infections cause more than 1.5 million deaths annually. With an increase in immune-deficient susceptible populations and the emergence of antifungal drug resistance, there is an urgent need for novel strategies to combat these life-threatening infections. Here, we use a combinatorial screening approach to identify an imidazopyrazoindole, NPD827, that synergizes with fluconazole against azole-sensitive and -resistant isolates of Candida albicans. NPD827 interacts with sterols, resulting in profound effects on fungal membrane homeostasis and induction of membrane-associated stress responses. The compound impairs virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of candidiasis, blocks C. albicans filamentation in vitro, and prevents biofilm formation in a rat model of catheter infection by C. albicans. Collectively, this work identifies an imidazopyrazoindole scaffold with a non-protein-targeted mode of action that re-sensitizes the leading human fungal pathogen, C. albicans, to azole antifungals.","There is an urgent need for novel strategies to combat life-threatening fungal infections. Here, Revie et al. identify a compound that induces alterations in fungal membranes, synergizes with azole antifungals against the pathogen Candida albicans, and inhibits virulence traits and biofilm formation in animal models of infection.",2022-06-25
1809,Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein forms nuclear condensates and regulates alternative splicing,"The diverse functions of WASP, the deficiency of which causes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), remain poorly defined. We generated three isogenic WAS models using patient induced pluripotent stem cells and genome editing. These models recapitulated WAS phenotypes and revealed that WASP deficiency causes an upregulation of numerous RNA splicing factors and widespread altered splicing. Loss of WASP binding to splicing factor gene promoters frequently leads to aberrant epigenetic activation. WASP interacts with dozens of nuclear speckle constituents and constrains SRSF2 mobility. Using an optogenetic system, we showed that WASP forms phase-separated condensates that encompasses SRSF2, nascent RNA and active Pol II. The role of WASP in gene body condensates is corroborated by ChIPseq and RIPseq. Together our data reveal that WASP is a nexus regulator of RNA splicing that controls the transcription of splicing factors epigenetically and the dynamics of the splicing machinery through liquid-liquid phase separation.","Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is caused by mutations in WASP, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. Here the authors reveal that WASP deficiency results in aberrant RNA splicing, and that WASP regulates the transcription of splicing factor genes and co-transcriptional RNA splicing via a phase-separation process that involves splicing factors and nascent RNA.",2022-06-25
1810,Effective high-throughput RT-qPCR screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections in children,"Systematic SARS-CoV-2 testing is a valuable tool for infection control and surveillance. However, broad application of high sensitive RT-qPCR testing in children is often hampered due to unpleasant sample collection, limited RT-qPCR capacities and high costs. Here, we developed a high-throughput approach (‘Lolli-Method’) for SARS-CoV-2 detection in children, combining non-invasive sample collection with an RT-qPCR-pool testing strategy. SARS-CoV-2 infections were diagnosed with sensitivities of 100% and 93.9% when viral loads were >106 copies/ml and >103 copies/ml in corresponding Naso-/Oropharyngeal-swabs, respectively. For effective application of the Lolli-Method in schools and daycare facilities, SEIR-modeling indicated a preferred frequency of two tests per week. The developed test strategy was implemented in 3,700 schools and 698 daycare facilities in Germany, screening over 800,000 individuals twice per week. In a period of 3 months, 6,364 pool-RT-qPCRs tested positive (0.64%), ranging from 0.05% to 2.61% per week. Notably, infections correlated with local SARS-CoV-2 incidences and with a school social deprivation index. Moreover, in comparison with the alpha variant, statistical modeling revealed a 36.8% increase for multiple (≥2 children) infections per class following infections with the delta variant. We conclude that the Lolli-Method is a powerful tool for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and can support infection control in schools and daycare facilities.",Dewald et al. combine a non-invasive sampling approach (Lolli-Test) with an RT qPCR-pool testing strategy to screen for SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and use the method for surveillance and infection control in > 4000 school and daycare settings.,2022-06-25
1811,Finely tunable dynamical coloration using bicontinuous micrometer-domains,"Nanostructures similar to those found in the vividly blue wings of Morpho butterflies and colorful photonic crystals enable structural color through constructive interference of light waves. Different from commonly studied structure-colored materials using periodic structures to manipulate optical properties, we report a previously unrecognized approach to precisely control the structural color and light transmission via a novel photonic colloidal gel without long-range order. Nanoparticles in this gel form micrometer-sized bicontinuous domains driven by the microphase separation of binary solvents. This approach enables dynamic coloration with a precise wavelength selectivity over a broad range of wavelengths extended well beyond the visible light that is not achievable with traditional methods. The dynamic wavelength selectivity is thermally tunable, reversible, and the material fabrication is easily scalable.","Structural colors are often produced by periodic structured materials leading to the constructive interference of light waves. Here, the authors report control of structural color and light transmission via a colloidal gel and dynamic coloration with a precise wavelength selectivity over a broad range of wavelengths by taking advantage of the Christiansen effect.",2022-06-24
1812,A microfluidic optimal experimental design platform for forward design of cell-free genetic networks,"Cell-free protein synthesis has been widely used as a “breadboard” for design of synthetic genetic networks. However, due to a severe lack of modularity, forward engineering of genetic networks remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate how a combination of optimal experimental design and microfluidics allows us to devise dynamic cell-free gene expression experiments providing maximum information content for subsequent non-linear model identification. Importantly, we reveal that applying this methodology to a library of genetic circuits, that share common elements, further increases the information content of the data resulting in higher accuracy of model parameters. To show modularity of model parameters, we design a pulse decoder and bistable switch, and predict their behaviour both qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, we update the parameter database and indicate that network topology affects parameter estimation accuracy. Utilizing our methodology provides us with more accurate model parameters, a necessity for forward engineering of complex genetic networks.","Characterization of cell-free genetic networks is inherently difficult. Here the authors use optimal experimental design and microfluidics to improve characterization, demonstrating modularity and predictability of parts in applied test cases.",2022-06-24
1813,The encephalomyocarditis virus Leader promotes the release of virions inside extracellular vesicles via the induction of secretory autophagy,"Naked viruses can escape host cells before the induction of lysis via release in extracellular vesicles (EVs). These nanosized EVs cloak the secreted virus particles in a host-derived membrane, which alters virus-host interactions that affect infection efficiency and antiviral immunity. Currently, little is known about the viral and host factors regulating this form of virus release. Here, we assessed the role of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) Leader protein, a ‘viral security protein’ that subverts the host antiviral response. EV release upon infection with wildtype virus or a Leader-deficient mutant was characterized at the single particle level using high-resolution flow cytometry. Inactivation of the Leader abolished EV induction during infection and strongly reduced EV-enclosed virus release. We demonstrate that the Leader promotes the release of virions within EVs by stimulating a secretory arm of autophagy. This newly discovered role of the EMCV Leader adds to the variety of mechanisms via which this protein affects virus-host interactions. Moreover, these data provide first evidence for a crucial role of a non-structural viral protein in the non-lytic release of picornaviruses via packaging in EVs.","Picornaviruses can escape infected cells via packaging in extracellular vesicles (EVs). Here, van der Grein et al. show that the non-structural Leader protein of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) promotes the release of EV-enclosed virus particles and provide evidence for a role of secretory autophagy in this process.",2022-06-24
1814,Chain flexibility of medicinal lipids determines their selective partitioning into lipid droplets,"In guiding lipid droplets (LDs) to serve as storage vessels that insulate high-value lipophilic compounds in cells, we demonstrate that chain flexibility of lipids determines their selective migration in intracellular LDs. Focusing on commercially important medicinal lipids with biogenetic similarity but structural dissimilarity, we computationally and experimentally validate that LD remodeling should be differentiated between overproduction of structurally flexible squalene and that of rigid zeaxanthin and β-carotene. In molecular dynamics simulations, worm-like flexible squalene is readily deformed to move through intertwined chains of triacylglycerols in the LD core, whereas rod-like rigid zeaxanthin is trapped on the LD surface due to a high free energy barrier in diffusion. By designing yeast cells with either much larger LDs or with a greater number of LDs, we observe that intracellular storage of squalene significantly increases with LD volume expansion, but that of zeaxanthin and β-carotene is enhanced through LD surface broadening; as visually evidenced, the outcomes represent internal penetration of squalene and surface localization of zeaxanthin and β-carotene. Our study shows the computational and experimental validation of selective lipid migration into a phase-separated organelle and reveals LD dynamics and functionalization.","Lipid droplet (LD) is a highly dynamic organelle capable of regulating lipid metabolism, storage and transportation. Here, by combining molecular dynamics simulations and microbial LD engineering, the authors demonstrate that the structural flexibility of lipids is one of decisive factors in selective partitioning into LDs.",2022-06-24
1815,A structural and functional subdivision in central orbitofrontal cortex,"Economic choice requires many cognitive subprocesses, including stimulus detection, valuation, motor output, and outcome monitoring; many of these subprocesses are associated with the central orbitofrontal cortex (cOFC). Prior work has largely assumed that the cOFC is a single region with a single function. Here, we challenge that unified view with convergent anatomical and physiological results from rhesus macaques. Anatomically, we show that the cOFC can be subdivided according to its much stronger (medial) or weaker (lateral) bidirectional anatomical connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). We call these subregions cOFCm and cOFCl, respectively. These two subregions have notable functional differences. Specifically, cOFCm shows enhanced functional connectivity with PCC, as indicated by both spike-field coherence and mutual information. The cOFCm-PCC circuit, but not the cOFCl-PCC circuit, shows signatures of relaying choice signals from a non-spatial comparison framework to a spatially framed organization and shows a putative bidirectional mutually excitatory pattern.",A portion of the orbitofrontal cortex can be subdivided by its connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex. This connectivity-based parcellation shows differences in functional connectivity and economic choice signals.,2022-06-24
1816,Porphyrin as a versatile visible-light-activatable organic/metal hybrid photoremovable protecting group,"Photoremovable protecting groups (PPGs) represent one of the main contemporary implementations of photochemistry in diverse fields of research and practical applications. For the past half century, organic and metal-complex PPGs were considered mutually exclusive classes, each of which provided unique sets of physical and chemical properties thanks to their distinctive structures. Here, we introduce the meso-methylporphyrin group as a prototype hybrid-class PPG that unites traditionally exclusive elements of organic and metal-complex PPGs within a single structure. We show that the porphyrin scaffold allows extensive modularity by functional separation of the metal-binding chromophore and up to four sites of leaving group release. The insertion of metal ions can be used to tune their spectroscopic, photochemical, and biological properties. We provide a detailed description of the photoreaction mechanism studied by steady-state and transient absorption spectroscopies and quantum-chemical calculations. Our approach applied herein could facilitate access to a hitherto untapped chemical space of potential PPG scaffolds.","Photoremovable protecting groups (PPGs) represent one of the main contemporary implementations of photochemistry.

1817,Cell surface glycan engineering reveals that matriglycan alone can recapitulate dystroglycan binding and function,"α-Dystroglycan (α-DG) is uniquely modified on O-mannose sites by a repeating disaccharide (-Xylα1,3-GlcAβ1,3-)n termed matriglycan, which is a receptor for laminin-G domain-containing proteins and employed by old-world arenaviruses for infection. Using chemoenzymatically synthesized matriglycans printed as a microarray, we demonstrate length-dependent binding to Laminin, Lassa virus GP1, and the clinically-important antibody IIH6. Utilizing an enzymatic engineering approach, an N-linked glycoprotein was converted into a IIH6-positive Laminin-binding glycoprotein. Engineering of the surface of cells deficient for either α-DG or O-mannosylation with matriglycans of sufficient length recovers infection with a Lassa-pseudovirus. Finally, free matriglycan in a dose and length dependent manner inhibits viral infection of wildtype cells. These results indicate that matriglycan alone is necessary and sufficient for IIH6 staining, Laminin and LASV GP1 binding, and Lassa-pseudovirus infection and support a model in which it is a tunable receptor for which increasing chain length enhances ligand-binding capacity.","Matriglycan, a repeating disaccharide on α-dystroglycan, is the receptor for Lassa virus and specific extracellular matrix proteins.

1818,Insights into the mechanism of action of the arbitrium communication system in SPbeta phages,"The arbitrium system is employed by phages of the SPbeta family to communicate with their progeny during infection to decide either to follow the lytic or the lysogenic cycle. The system is controlled by a peptide, AimP, that binds to the regulator AimR, inhibiting its DNA-binding activity and expression of aimX. Although the structure of AimR has been elucidated for phages SPβ and phi3T, there is still controversy regarding the molecular mechanism of AimR function, with two different proposed models for SPβ. In this study, we deepen our understanding of the system by solving the structure of an additional AimR that shows chimerical characteristics with the SPβ receptor. The crystal structures of this AimR (apo, AimP-bound and DNA-bound) together with in vitro and in vivo analyses confirm a mechanism of action by AimP-induced conformational restriction, shedding light on peptide specificity and cross regulation with relevant biological implications.","The arbitrium system is a peptide-based communication system to coordinate the lysis-lysogenic cycle of phages infecting bacteria. Here Gallego del Sol et al. provide the crystal structure of Aim-receptor of Katmira phage infecting B. subtilis in apo, peptide-bound and DNA-bound form.",2022-06-24
1819,A phase 1b randomised controlled trial of a glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon receptor dual agonist IBI362 (LY3305677) in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes,"The success of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity has sparked considerable efforts to develop next-generation co-agonists that are more effective. We conducted a randomised, placebo-controlled phase 1b study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04466904) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IBI362 (LY3305677), a GLP-1 and glucagon receptor dual agonist, in Chinese patients with T2D. A total of 43 patients with T2D were enrolled in three cohorts in nine study centres in China and randomised in each cohort to receive once-weekly IBI362 (3.0 mg, 4.5 mg or 6.0 mg), placebo or open-label dulaglutide (1.5 mg) subcutaneously for 12 weeks. Forty-two patients received the study treatment and were included in the analysis, with eight receiving IBI362, four receiving placebo and two receiving dulaglutide in each cohort. The patients, investigators and study site personnel involved in treating and assessing patients in each cohort were masked to IBI362 and placebo allocation. Primary outcomes were safety and tolerability of IBI362. Secondary outcomes included the change in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and post-mixed-meal tolerance test (post-MTT) glucose levels. IBI362 was well tolerated. Most commonly-reported treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhoea (29.2% for IBI362, 33.3% for dulaglutide, 0% for placebo), decreased appetite (25.0% for IBI362, 16.7% for dulaglutide, 0% for placebo) and nausea (16.7% for IBI362, 16.7% for dulaglutide and 8.3% for placebo). HbA1c, FPG and post-MTT glucose levels were reduced from baseline to week 12 in patients receiving IBI362 in all three cohorts. IBI362 showed a favourable safety profile and clinically meaningful reductions in blood glucose in Chinese patients with T2D.","Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists are used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D), and polyagonists targeting multiple hormone receptors are investigated as potential therapeutics for T2D.

1820,Bipolar membrane electrolyzers enable high single-pass CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products,"In alkaline and neutral MEA CO2 electrolyzers, CO2 rapidly converts to (bi)carbonate, imposing a significant energy penalty arising from separating CO2 from the anode gas outlets. Here we report a CO2 electrolyzer uses a bipolar membrane (BPM) to convert (bi)carbonate back to CO2, preventing crossover; and that surpasses the single-pass utilization (SPU) limit (25% for multi-carbon products, C2+) suffered by previous neutral-media electrolyzers. We employ a stationary unbuffered catholyte layer between BPM and cathode to promote C2+ products while ensuring that (bi)carbonate is converted back, in situ, to CO2 near the cathode. We develop a model that enables the design of the catholyte layer, finding that limiting the diffusion path length of reverted CO2 to ~10 μm balances the CO2 diffusion flux with the regeneration rate. We report a single-pass CO2 utilization of 78%, which lowers the energy associated with downstream separation of CO2 by 10× compared with past systems.","In the carbon dioxide (CO2) to multicarbon electrolysis, the crossover CO2 to the oxygen-rich anodic gas stream add a further energy-intensive chemical separation step.

1821,Toggle-like current-induced Bloch point dynamics of 3D skyrmion strings in a room temperature nanowire,"Research into practical applications of magnetic skyrmions, nanoscale solitons with interesting topological and transport properties, has traditionally focused on two dimensional (2D) thin-film systems. However, the recent observation of novel three dimensional (3D) skyrmion-like structures, such as hopfions, skyrmion strings (SkS), skyrmion bundles, and skyrmion braids, motivates the investigation of new designs, aiming to exploit the third spatial dimension for more compact and higher performance spintronic devices in 3D or curvilinear geometries. A crucial requirement of such device schemes is the control of the 3D magnetic structures via charge or spin currents, which has yet to be experimentally observed. In this work, we utilise real-space imaging to investigate the dynamics of a 3D SkS within a nanowire of Co8Zn9Mn3 at room temperature. Utilising single current pulses, we demonstrate current-induced nucleation of a single SkS, and a toggle-like positional switching of an individual Bloch point at the end of a SkS. The observations highlight the possibility to locally manipulate 3D topological spin textures, opening up a range of design concepts for future 3D spintronic devices.","In three dimensional systems with broken bulk inversion symmetry, skyrmions can form extended string-like structures. Here, Birch et al use scanning transmission x-ray microscopy to demonstrate the current induced generation and motion of these three dimensional skyrmion strings.",2022-06-24
1822,Sizing up DNA nanostructure assembly with native mass spectrometry and ion mobility,"Recent interest in biological and synthetic DNA nanostructures has highlighted the need for methods to comprehensively characterize intermediates and end products of multimeric DNA assembly. Here we use native mass spectrometry in combination with ion mobility to determine the mass, charge state and collision cross section of noncovalent DNA assemblies, and thereby elucidate their structural composition, oligomeric state, overall size and shape. We showcase the approach with a prototypical six-subunit DNA nanostructure to reveal how its assembly is governed by the ionic strength of the buffer, as well as how the mass and mobility of heterogeneous species can be well resolved by careful tuning of instrumental parameters. We find that the assembly of the hexameric, barrel-shaped complex is guided by positive cooperativity, while previously undetected higher-order 12- and 18-mer assemblies are assigned to defined larger-diameter geometric structures. Guided by our insight, ion mobility-mass spectrometry is poised to make significant contributions to understanding the formation and structural diversity of natural and synthetic oligonucleotide assemblies relevant in science and technology.","Interest in oligonucleotide nanostructures has recently surged in basic and applied research.

1823,Visible light-controlled living cationic polymerization of methoxystyrene,"Photo-controlled living polymerization has received great attention in recent years. However, despite the great success therein, the report on photo-controlled living cationic polymerization has been greatly limited. We demonstrate here a novel decolorable, metal-free and visible light-controlled living cationic polymerization system by using tris(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate as the photocatalyst and phosphate as the chain transfer agent (CTA) for polymerization of 4-methoxystyrene. This polymerization reaction under green LED light irradiation shows clear living characteristics including predictable molar mass, low molar-mass dispersity (Đ = 1.25), and sequential polymerization capability. In addition, the photocatalytic system exits excellent “on-off” photo switchability and shows the longest “off period” of 36 h up to now for photo-controlled cationic polymerization. Furthermore, the residual photo-catalyst is easily deactivated and decolored with addition of a base after the polymerization. The present study has extended the photo-controlled living cationic polymerization systems with new organic photocatalysts, phosphate CTA and polymerizable monomer as well as the new properties of excellent photostability and in-situ decolored capacity.","Photo-controlled living polymerization has received great attention in recent years but the reports on photo-controlled living cationic polymerization are limited.

1824,Coordination of metal center biogenesis in human cytochrome c oxidase,"Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) or respiratory chain complex IV is a heme aa3-copper oxygen reductase containing metal centers essential for holo-complex biogenesis and enzymatic function that are assembled by subunit-specific metallochaperones. The enzyme has two copper sites located in the catalytic core subunits. The COX1 subunit harbors the CuB site that tightly associates with heme a3 while the COX2 subunit contains the binuclear CuA site. Here, we report that in human cells the CcO copper chaperones form macromolecular assemblies and cooperate with several twin CX9C proteins to control heme a biosynthesis and coordinate copper transfer sequentially to the CuA and CuB sites. These data on CcO illustrate a mechanism that regulates the biogenesis of macromolecular enzymatic assemblies with several catalytic metal redox centers and prevents the accumulation of cytotoxic reactive assembly intermediates.","Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase is a heme aa3-copper oxygen reductase. Here, authors report that metal center-specific metallochaperones form dynamic assemblies to control heme a biosynthesis and coordinate copper transfer to the copper sites.",2022-06-24
1825,Results of the phase I CCTG IND.231 trial of CX-5461 in patients with advanced solid tumors enriched for DNA-repair deficiencies,"CX-5461 is a G-quadruplex stabilizer that exhibits synthetic lethality in homologous recombination-deficient models. In this multicentre phase I trial in patients with solid tumors, 40 patients are treated across 10 dose levels (50–650 mg/m2) to determine the recommended phase II dose (primary outcome), and evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (secondary outcomes). Defective homologous recombination is explored as a predictive biomarker of response. CX-5461 is generally well tolerated, with a recommended phase II dose of 475 mg/m2 days 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks, and dose limiting phototoxicity. Responses are observed in 14% of patients, primarily in patients with defective homologous recombination. Reversion mutations in PALB2 and BRCA2 are detected on progression following initial response in germline carriers, confirming the underlying synthetic lethal mechanism. In vitro characterization of UV sensitization shows this toxicity is related to the CX-5461 chemotype, independent of G-quadruplex synthetic lethality. These results establish clinical proof-of-concept for this G-quadruplex stabilizer.

1826,A glycine-rich PE_PGRS protein governs mycobacterial actin-based motility,"Many key insights into actin regulation have been derived through examining how microbial pathogens intercept the actin cytoskeleton during infection. Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, polymerizes host actin at the bacterial surface to drive intracellular movement and cell-to-cell spread during infection. However, the mycobacterial factor that commandeers actin polymerization has remained elusive. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the M. marinum actin-based motility factor designated mycobacterial intracellular rockets A (MirA), which is a member of the glycine-rich PE_PGRS protein family. MirA contains an amphipathic helix to anchor into the mycobacterial outer membrane and, surprisingly, also the surface of host lipid droplet organelles. MirA directly binds to and activates the host protein N-WASP to stimulate actin polymerization through the Arp2/3 complex, directing both bacterial and lipid droplet actin-based motility. MirA is dissimilar to known N-WASP activating ligands and may represent a new class of microbial and host actin regulator. Additionally, the MirA-N-WASP interaction represents a model to understand how the enigmatic PE_PGRS proteins contribute to mycobacterial pathogenesis.","Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, polymerizes host actin at the bacterial surface to drive intracellular movement and cell-to-cell spread during infection.

1827,Spatiotemporal analysis of glioma heterogeneity reveals COL1A1 as an actionable target to disrupt tumor progression,"Intra-tumoral heterogeneity is a hallmark of glioblastoma that challenges treatment efficacy. However, the mechanisms that set up tumor heterogeneity and tumor cell migration remain poorly understood. Herein, we present a comprehensive spatiotemporal study that aligns distinctive intra-tumoral histopathological structures, oncostreams, with dynamic properties and a specific, actionable, spatial transcriptomic signature. Oncostreams are dynamic multicellular fascicles of spindle-like and aligned cells with mesenchymal properties, detected using ex vivo explants and in vivo intravital imaging. Their density correlates with tumor aggressiveness in genetically engineered mouse glioma models, and high grade human gliomas. Oncostreams facilitate the intra-tumoral distribution of tumoral and non-tumoral cells, and potentially the collective invasion of the normal brain. These fascicles are defined by a specific molecular signature that regulates their organization and function. Oncostreams structure and function depend on overexpression of COL1A1. Col1a1 is a central gene in the dynamic organization of glioma mesenchymal transformation, and a powerful regulator of glioma malignant behavior. Inhibition of Col1a1 eliminates oncostreams, reprograms the malignant histopathological phenotype, reduces expression of the mesenchymal associated genes, induces changes in the tumor microenvironment and prolongs animal survival. Oncostreams represent a pathological marker of potential value for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.","It is essential to improve our understanding of the features that influence aggressiveness and invasion in high grade gliomas (HGG). Here, the authors characterize dynamic anatomical structures in HGG called oncostreams, which are associated with tumor growth and are regulated by COL1A1.",2022-06-24
1828,Cross-cutting scenarios and strategies for designing decarbonization pathways in the transport sector toward carbon neutrality,"The transport sector will play a pivotal role in achieving China’s carbon neutrality goal by 2060. This study develops a regional transport-energy integrated model to analyze the long-term pathways and strategies toward the carbon-neutral ground transport sector in China. A set of scenarios are created to identify the effectiveness and feasibility of low-carbon policy measures based on the well-known transport strategies within the Avoid–Shift–Improve framework. Our simulations shed light on synergistic coupling and trade-offs among different strategies and instruments for prescribing a desirable mix of policy measures that maximize the synergies and minimize the trade-offs. Here, we show that a region-specific policy package designed from a balanced perspective under the Avoid–Shift–Improve framework has the potential to realize a deep decarbonization in the transport sector and will greatly assist in achieving China’s carbon neutrality by 2060.",New study shows how region-specific policy under the Avoid–Shift–Improve framework may aid in realizing a deep decarbonization in the transport sector and assist in achieving China’s carbon neutrality goals.,2022-06-24
1829,Construction of a synthetic Saccharomyces cerevisiae pan-genome neo-chromosome,"The Synthetic Yeast Genome Project (Sc2.0) represents the first foray into eukaryotic genome engineering and a framework for designing and building the next generation of industrial microbes. However, the laboratory strain S288c used lacks many of the genes that provide phenotypic diversity to industrial and environmental isolates. To address this shortcoming, we have designed and constructed a neo-chromosome that contains many of these diverse pan-genomic elements and which is compatible with the Sc2.0 design and test framework. The presence of this neo-chromosome provides phenotypic plasticity to the Sc2.0 parent strain, including expanding the range of utilizable carbon sources. We also demonstrate that the induction of programmable structural variation (SCRaMbLE) provides genetic diversity on which further adaptive gains could be selected. The presence of this neo-chromosome within the Sc2.0 backbone may therefore provide the means to adapt synthetic strains to a wider variety of environments, a process which will be vital to transitioning Sc2.0 from the laboratory into industrial applications.","The Sc2.0 consortia is reengineering the yeast genome. To expand the Sc2.0 genetic repertoire, the authors build a neo-chromosome comprising variable loci from diverse yeast isolates, providing phenotypic plasticity for use in synthetic backgrounds.",2022-06-24
1830,Decoupled temperature and pressure hydrothermal synthesis of carbon sub-micron spheres from cellulose,"The temperature and pressure of the hydrothermal process occurring in a batch reactor are typically coupled. Herein, we develop a decoupled temperature and pressure hydrothermal system that can heat the cellulose at a constant pressure, thus lowering the degradation temperature of cellulose significantly and enabling the fast production of carbon sub-micron spheres. Carbon sub-micron spheres can be produced without any isothermal time, much faster compared to the conventional hydrothermal process. High-pressure water can help to cleave the hydrogen bonds in cellulose and facilitate dehydration reactions, thus promoting cellulose carbonization at low temperatures. A life cycle assessment based on a conceptual biorefinery design reveals that this technology leads to a substantial reduction in carbon emissions when hydrochar replacing fuel or used for soil amendment. Overall, the decoupled temperature and pressure hydrothermal treatment in this study provides a promising method to produce sustainable carbon materials from cellulose with a carbon-negative effect.","Temperature and pressure are typically dependent parameters in hydrothermal processes. Here, authors devise a hydrothermal system that allows independent control of these parameters and realize low-temperature fast synthesis of carbon sub-micron spheres directly from cellulose at higher pressure.",2022-06-24
1831,DNA damage-induced transcription stress triggers the genome-wide degradation of promoter-bound Pol II,"The precise regulation of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcription after genotoxic stress is crucial for proper execution of the DNA damage-induced stress response. While stalling of Pol II on transcription-blocking lesions (TBLs) blocks transcript elongation and initiates DNA repair in cis, TBLs additionally elicit a response in trans that regulates transcription genome-wide. Here we uncover that, after an initial elongation block in cis, TBLs trigger the genome-wide VCP-mediated proteasomal degradation of promoter-bound, P-Ser5-modified Pol II in trans. This degradation is mechanistically distinct from processing of TBL-stalled Pol II, is signaled via GSK3, and contributes to the TBL-induced transcription block, even in transcription-coupled repair-deficient cells. Thus, our data reveal the targeted degradation of promoter-bound Pol II as a critical pathway that allows cells to cope with DNA damage-induced transcription stress and enables the genome-wide adaptation of transcription to genotoxic stress.","DNA damage inhibits elongating RNA polymerase II, but also initiates genome-wide transcriptional responses. Here the authors reveal that particularly promoter-bound Pol II is degraded upon DNA damage in a GSK3 signaling-mediated response.",2022-06-24
1832,Contribution of low population immunity to the severe Omicron BA.2 outbreak in Hong Kong,"Monitoring population protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants is critical for risk assessment. We hypothesize that Hong Kong’s explosive Omicron BA.2 outbreak in early 2022 could be explained by low herd immunity. Our seroprevalence study using sera collected from January to December 2021 shows a very low prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against ancestral virus among older adults. The age group-specific prevalence of NAb generally correlates with the vaccination uptake rate, but older adults have a much lower NAb seropositive rate than vaccination uptake rate. For all age groups, the seroprevalence of NAb against Omicron variant is much lower than that against the ancestral virus. Our study suggests that this BA.2 outbreak and the exceptionally high case-fatality rate in the ≥80 year-old age group (9.2%) could be attributed to the lack of protective immunity in the population, especially among the vulnerable older adults, and that ongoing sero-surveillance is essential.","Hong Kong experienced a severe wave of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2022. Here, the authors use genomic and serosurveillance data and show that this wave was dominated by the Omicron BA.2 sublineage, and that low protective immunity, particularly in older age groups, contributed to its severity.",2022-06-24
1833,Endothelial cell heterogeneity and microglia regulons revealed by a pig cell landscape at single-cell level,"Pigs are valuable large animal models for biomedical and genetic research, but insights into the tissue- and cell-type-specific transcriptome and heterogeneity remain limited. By leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing, we generate a multiple-organ single-cell transcriptomic map containing over 200,000 pig cells from 20 tissues/organs. We comprehensively characterize the heterogeneity of cells in tissues and identify 234 cell clusters, representing 58 major cell types. In-depth integrative analysis of endothelial cells reveals a high degree of heterogeneity. We identify several functionally distinct endothelial cell phenotypes, including an endothelial to mesenchymal transition subtype in adipose tissues. Intercellular communication analysis predicts tissue- and cell type-specific crosstalk between endothelial cells and other cell types through the VEGF, PDGF, TGF-β, and BMP pathways. Regulon analysis of single-cell transcriptome of microglia in pig and 12 other species further identifies MEF2C as an evolutionally conserved regulon in the microglia. Our work describes the landscape of single-cell transcriptomes within diverse pig organs and identifies the heterogeneity of endothelial cells and evolutionally conserved regulon in microglia.","Pigs are important large animal models for biomedical research.

1834,"Neutralization of Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3 SARS-CoV-2 by 3 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine","The newly emerged Omicron SARS-CoV-2 has several distinct sublineages including BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3. BA.1 accounts for the initial surge and is being replaced by BA.2, whereas BA.3 is at a low prevalence at this time. Here we report the neutralization of BNT162b2-vaccinated sera (collected 1 month after dose 3) against the three Omicron sublineages. To facilitate the neutralization testing, we have engineered the complete BA.1, BA.2, or BA.3 spike into an mNeonGreen USA-WA1/2020 SRAS-CoV-2. All BNT162b2-vaccinated sera neutralize USA-WA1/2020, BA.1-, BA.2-, and BA.3-spike SARS-CoV-2s with titers of >20; the neutralization geometric mean titers (GMTs) against the four viruses are 1211, 336, 300, and 190, respectively. Thus, the BA.1-, BA.2-, and BA.3-spike SARS-CoV-2s are 3.6-, 4.0-, and 6.4-fold less efficiently neutralized than the USA-WA1/2020, respectively. Our data have implications in vaccine strategy and understanding the biology of Omicron sublineages.","It is essential to test the neutralization of approved vaccines against SARSCoV-2 Omicron sublineages.

1835,Breaking the nanoparticle’s dispersible limit via rotatable surface ligands,"Achieving versatile dispersion of nanoparticles in a broad range of solvents (e.g., water, oil, and biofluids) without repeatedly recourse to chemical modifications are desirable in optoelectronic devices, self-assembly, sensing, and biomedical fields. However, such a target is limited by the strategies used to decorate nanoparticle’s surface properties, leading to a narrow range of solvents for existing nanoparticles. Here we report a concept to break the nanoparticle’s dispersible limit via electrochemically anchoring surface ligands capable of sensing the surrounding liquid medium and rotating to adapt to it, immediately forming stable dispersions in a wide range of solvents (polar and nonpolar, biofluids, etc.). Moreover, the smart nanoparticles can be continuously electrodeposited in the electrolyte, overcoming the electrode surface-confined low throughput limitation of conventional electrodeposition methods. The anomalous dispersive property of the smart Ag nanoparticles enables them to resist bacteria secreted species-induced aggregation and the structural similarity of the surface ligands to that of the bacterial membrane assists them to enter the bacteria, leading to high antibacterial activity. The simple but massive fabrication process and the enhanced dispersion properties offer great application opportunities to the smart nanoparticles in diverse fields.","Nanoparticles that can disperse in a broad range of solvents are desirable.

1836,The obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi differentiates into a developmentally distinct extracellular state,"Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ot) is an obligate intracellular bacterium in the family Rickettsiaceae that causes scrub typhus, a severe mite-borne human disease. Its mechanism of cell exit is unusual amongst Rickettsiaceae, as Ot buds off the surface of infected cells enveloped in plasma membrane. Here, we show that Ot bacteria that have budded out of host cells are in a distinct developmental stage compared with intracellular bacteria. We refer to these two stages as intracellular and extracellular bacteria (IB and EB, respectively). These two forms differ in physical properties: IB is both round and elongated, and EB is round. Additionally, IB has higher levels of peptidoglycan and is physically robust compared with EB. The two bacterial forms differentially express proteins involved in bacterial physiology and host-pathogen interactions, specifically those involved in bacterial dormancy and stress response, and outer membrane autotransporter proteins ScaA and ScaC. Whilst both populations are infectious, entry of IB Ot is sensitive to inhibitors of both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis, whereas entry of EB Ot is only sensitive to a macropinocytosis inhibitor. Our identification and detailed characterization of two developmental forms of Ot significantly advances our understanding of the intracellular lifecycle of an important human pathogen.","Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ot) the causing agent of scrub typhus exits infected cells using a unique mechanism that involves budding off the surface of infected cells. Here, Atwal et al. report that Ots that have budded from their host cells are in a distinct developmental stage than intracellular bacteria and provide the first characterization of this extracellular stage.

1837,"All-in-one, bio-inspired, and low-power crypto engines for near-sensor security based on two-dimensional memtransistors","In the emerging era of the internet of things (IoT), ubiquitous sensors continuously collect, consume, store, and communicate a huge volume of information which is becoming increasingly vulnerable to theft and misuse. Modern software cryptosystems require extensive computational infrastructure for implementing ciphering algorithms, making them difficult to be adopted by IoT edge sensors that operate with limited hardware resources and at low energy budgets. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate an “all-in-one” 8 × 8 array of robust, low-power, and bio-inspired crypto engines monolithically integrated with IoT edge sensors based on two-dimensional (2D) memtransistors. Each engine comprises five 2D memtransistors to accomplish sensing and encoding functionalities.

1838,Targeting climate adaptation to safeguard and advance the Sustainable Development Goals,"The international community has committed to achieve 169 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets by 2030 and to enhance climate adaptation under the Paris Agreement. Despite the potential for synergies, aligning SDG and climate adaptation efforts is inhibited by an inadequate understanding of the complex relationship between SDG targets and adaptation to impacts of climate change. Here we propose a framework to conceptualise how ecosystems and socio-economic sectors mediate this relationship, which provides a more nuanced understanding of the impacts of climate change on all 169 SDG targets. Global application of the framework reveals that adaptation of wetlands, rivers, cropland, construction, water, electricity, and housing in the most vulnerable countries is required to safeguard achievement of 68% of SDG targets from near-term climate risk by 2030. We discuss how our framework can help align National Adaptation Plans with SDG targets, thus ensuring that adaptation advances, rather than detracts from, sustainable development.","Without targeted climate adaptation, impacts of climate change threaten achievement of all 169 SDG targets. Fuldauer et al. provide an actionable framework to assess these impacts and help systematically align national adaptation plans with the SDGs.",2022-06-23
1839,A broadly neutralizing antibody protects Syrian hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron challenge,"The strikingly high transmissibility and antibody evasion of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants have posed great challenges to the efficacy of current vaccines and antibody immunotherapy. Here, we screen 34 BNT162b2-vaccinees and isolate a public broadly neutralizing antibody ZCB11 derived from the IGHV1-58 family. ZCB11 targets viral receptor-binding domain specifically and neutralizes all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, especially with great potency against authentic Omicron and Delta variants. Pseudovirus-based mapping of 57 naturally occurred spike mutations or deletions reveals that S371L results in 11-fold neutralization resistance, but it is rescued by compensating mutations in Omicron variants. Cryo-EM analysis demonstrates that ZCB11 heavy chain predominantly interacts with Omicron spike trimer with receptor-binding domain in up conformation blocking ACE2 binding. In addition, prophylactic or therapeutic ZCB11 administration protects lung infection against Omicron viral challenge in golden Syrian hamsters. These results suggest that vaccine-induced ZCB11 is a promising broadly neutralizing antibody for biomedical interventions against pandemic SARS-CoV-2.","SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as the Omicron variant pose a challenge for vaccination and antibody immunotherapy.

1840,Identification of a quasi-liquid phase at solid–liquid interface,"An understanding of solid–liquid interfaces is of great importance for fundamental research as well as industrial applications. However, it has been very challenging to directly image solid–liquid interfaces with high resolution, thus their structure and properties are often unknown. Here, we report a quasi-liquid phase between metal (In, Sn) nanoparticle surfaces and an aqueous solution observed using liquid cell transmission electron microscopy. Our real-time high-resolution imaging reveals a thin layer of liquid-like materials at the interfaces with the frequent appearance of small In nanoclusters. Such a quasi-liquid phase serves as an intermediate for the mass transport from the metal nanoparticle to the liquid. Density functional theory-molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the positive charges of In ions greatly contribute to the stabilization of the quasi-liquid phase on the metal surface.","Solid–liquid interfaces are ubiquitous in natural and technological processes, but their imaging at the atomic scale has been challenging.

1841,Transcription factor-driven coordination of cell cycle exit and lineage-specification in vivo during granulocytic differentiation,"Differentiation of multipotent stem cells into mature cells is fundamental for development and homeostasis of mammalian tissues, and requires the coordinated induction of lineage-specific transcriptional programs and cell cycle withdrawal. To understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms of this fundamental process, we investigated how the tissue-specific transcription factors, CEBPA and CEBPE, coordinate cell cycle exit and lineage-specification in vivo during granulocytic differentiation. We demonstrate that CEBPA promotes lineage-specification by launching an enhancer-primed differentiation program and direct activation of CEBPE expression. Subsequently, CEBPE confers promoter-driven cell cycle exit by sequential repression of MYC target gene expression at the G1/S transition and E2F-meditated G2/M gene expression, as well as by the up-regulation of Cdk1/2/4 inhibitors. Following cell cycle exit, CEBPE unleashes the CEBPA-primed differentiation program to generate mature granulocytes. These findings highlight how tissue-specific transcription factors coordinate cell cycle exit with differentiation through the use of distinct gene regulatory elements.","Here the authors show that differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells into mature blood cells is primed by cell type-specific transcription factors at the enhancer level during early differentiation, before they confere promoter-driven growth arrest, and activate post-mitotic terminal differentiation.",2022-06-23
1842,In situ 3D bioprinting with bioconcrete bioink,"In-situ bioprinting is attractive for directly depositing the therapy bioink at the defective organs to repair them, especially for occupations such as soldiers, athletes, and drivers who can be injured in emergency. However, traditional bioink displays obvious limitations in its complex operation environments. Here, we design a bioconcrete bioink with electrosprayed cell-laden microgels as the aggregate and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) precursor solution as the cement. Promising printability is guaranteed with a wide temperature range benefiting from robust rheological properties of photocrosslinked microgel aggregate and fluidity of GelMA cement. Composite components simultaneously self-adapt to biocompatibility and different tissue mechanical microenvironment. Strong binding on tissue-hydrogel interface is achieved by hydrogen bonds and friction when the cement is photocrosslinked. This bioink owns good portability and can be easily prepared in urgent accidents. Meanwhile, microgels can be cultured to mini tissues and then mixed as bioink aggregates, indicating our bioconcrete can be functionalized faster than normal bioinks. The cranial defects repair results verify the superiority of this bioink and its potential in clinical settings required in in-situ treatment.","Bioinks used in current in-situ bioprinting have limitations when applied to complex operational environments. Here, the authors report on the creation of a microgel reinforced GelMA bioink which can be simply prepared and used in different biomedical settings. The application is demonstrated in a cranial defect model.",2022-06-23
1843,Single molecule demonstration of Debye–Stokes–Einstein breakdown in polystyrene near the glass transition temperature,"Rotational-translational decoupling, in which translational motion is apparently enhanced over rotational motion in violation of Stokes-Einstein (SE) and Debye-Stokes-Einstein (DSE) predictions, has been observed in materials near their glass transition temperatures (Tg). This has been posited to result from ensemble averaging in the context of dynamic heterogeneity. In this work, ensemble and single molecule experiments are performed in parallel on a fluorescent probe in high molecular weight polystyrene near its Tg. Ensemble results show decoupling onset at approximately 1.15Tg, increasing to over three orders of magnitude at Tg. Single molecule measurements also show a high degree of decoupling, with typical molecules at Tg showing translational diffusion coefficients nearly 400 times higher than expected from SE/DSE predictions. At the single molecule level, higher degree of breakdown is associated with particularly mobile molecules and anisotropic trajectories, providing support for anomalous diffusion as a critical driver of rotational-translational decoupling and SE/DSE breakdown.","Experiments with high-molecular-weight polystyrene provide insights into the mechanisms behind rotational-translational decoupling in glassy systems. Specifically, particularly mobile molecules exhibiting anisotropic trajectories are found to play a key role in Debye-Stokes-Einstein breakdown.",2022-06-23
1844,An intein-split transactivator for intersectional neural imaging and optogenetic manipulation,"The cell-type-specific recording and manipulation is instrumental to disentangle causal neural mechanisms in physiology and behavior and increasingly requires intersectional control; however, current approaches are largely limited by the number of intersectional features, incompatibility of common effectors and insufficient gene expression. Here, we utilized the protein-splicing technique mediated by intervening sequences (intein) and devised an intein-based intersectional synthesis of transactivator (IBIST) to selectively control gene expression of common effectors in multiple-feature defined cell types in mice. We validated the specificity and sufficiency of IBIST to control fluorophores, optogenetic opsins and Ca2+ indicators in various intersectional conditions. The IBIST-based Ca2+ imaging showed that the IBIST can intersect five features and that hippocampal neurons tune differently to distinct emotional stimuli depending on the pattern of projection targets. Collectively, the IBIST multiplexes the capability to intersect cell-type features and controls common effectors to effectively regulate gene expression, monitor and manipulate neural activities.","Cell-type-specific recording and manipulation is important for understanding neural circuits. Here the authors describe molecular tools to access cell types based on genetics and connectivity in the brain, and demonstrated the utility of these tools in neural recording and manipulations.",2022-06-23
1845,Peripherally restricted transthyretin-based delivery system for probes and therapeutics avoiding opioid-related side effects,"Several investigations into the sites of action of opioid analgesics have utilized peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs), which have been incorrectly assumed to possess limited permeability across the blood-brain barrier. Unfortunately, the poor pharmacokinetic properties of current PAMORAs have resulted in misunderstandings of the role of central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract in precipitating side effects such as opioid-induced constipation. Here, we develop a drug delivery approach for restricting the passage of small molecules across the blood-brain barrier. This allows us to develop naloxone- and oxycodone-based conjugates that display superior potency, peripheral selectivity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in rats compared to other clinically used PAMORAs. These probes allow us to demonstrate that the mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system have a fundamental role in precipitating opioid-induced constipation. Therefore, our conjugates have immediate use as pharmacological probes and potential therapeutic agents for treating constipation and other opioid-related side effects.","The current peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists present limited permeability and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, the authors develop a drug delivery approach based on AG10, which demonstrates the impact of mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system in precipitating opioid-induced constipation.",2022-06-23
1846,Substrate binding in the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier is a step-wise process guiding the structural changes in the transport cycle,"Mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers import ADP into the mitochondrial matrix and export ATP to the cytosol to fuel cellular processes. Structures of the inhibited cytoplasmic- and matrix-open states have confirmed an alternating access transport mechanism, but the molecular details of substrate binding remain unresolved. Here, we evaluate the role of the solvent-exposed residues of the translocation pathway in the process of substrate binding. We identify the main binding site, comprising three positively charged and a set of aliphatic and aromatic residues, which bind ADP and ATP in both states. Additionally, there are two pairs of asparagine/arginine residues on opposite sides of this site that are involved in substrate binding in a state-dependent manner. Thus, the substrates are directed through a series of binding poses, inducing the conformational changes of the carrier that lead to their translocation. The properties of this site explain the electrogenic and reversible nature of adenine nucleotide transport.","The mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier transports adenine nucleotides. Here, authors identify the residues involved in substrate binding. One set forms the central substrate binding site and two asparagine/arginine pairs help to guide the substrates during the transport cycle.",2022-06-23
1847,Anderson transition in stoichiometric Fe2VAl: high thermoelectric performance from impurity bands,"Discovered more than 200 years ago in 1821, thermoelectricity is nowadays of global interest as it enables direct interconversion of thermal and electrical energy via the Seebeck/Peltier effect. In their seminal work, Mahan and Sofo mathematically derived the conditions for ’the best thermoelectric’—a delta-distribution-shaped electronic transport function, where charge carriers contribute to transport only in an infinitely narrow energy interval. So far, however, only approximations to this concept were expected to exist in nature. Here, we propose the Anderson transition in a narrow impurity band as a physical realisation of this seemingly unrealisable scenario. An innovative approach of continuous disorder tuning allows us to drive the Anderson transition within a single sample: variable amounts of antisite defects are introduced in a controlled fashion by thermal quenching from high temperatures. Consequently, we obtain a significant enhancement and dramatic change of the thermoelectric properties from p-type to n-type in stoichiometric Fe2VAl, which we assign to a narrow region of delocalised electrons in the energy spectrum near the Fermi energy. Based on our electronic transport and magnetisation experiments, supported by Monte-Carlo and density functional theory calculations, we present a novel strategy to enhance the performance of thermoelectric materials.","The mathematical conditions for the best thermoelectric is well known but never realised in real materials. Here, the authors propose the Anderson transition in a narrow impurity band as a physical realisation of this seemingly unrealisable scenario.",2022-06-23
1848,Impact of interannual and multidecadal trends on methane-climate feedbacks and sensitivity,"We estimate the causal contributions of spatiotemporal changes in temperature (T) and precipitation (Pr) to changes in Earth’s atmospheric methane concentration (CCH4) and its isotope ratio δ13CH4 over the last four decades. We identify oscillations between positive and negative feedbacks, showing that both contribute to increasing CCH4. Interannually, increased emissions via positive feedbacks (e.g. wetland emissions and wildfires) with higher land surface air temperature (LSAT) are often followed by increasing CCH4 due to weakened methane sink via atmospheric •OH, via negative feedbacks with lowered sea surface temperatures (SST), especially in the tropics. Over decadal time scales, we find alternating rate-limiting factors for methane oxidation: when CCH4 is limiting, positive methane-climate feedback via direct oceanic emissions dominates; when •OH is limiting, negative feedback is favoured. Incorporating the interannually increasing CCH4 via negative feedbacks gives historical methane-climate feedback sensitivity ≈ 0.08 W m−2 °C−1, much higher than the IPCC AR6 estimate.","Record-breaking rates of increasing atmospheric methane concentrations in 2020 and 2021 are alarming, but puzzling, in view of declining methane emissions from fossil fuel in 2020. The authors show that interannual variation of both positive and negative feedbacks contribute positively to the rising methane concentration.",2022-06-23
1849,Mnemonic construction and representation of temporal structure in the hippocampal formation,"The hippocampal-entorhinal region supports memory for episodic details, such as temporal relations of sequential events, and mnemonic constructions combining experiences for inferential reasoning. However, it is unclear whether hippocampal event memories reflect temporal relations derived from mnemonic constructions, event order, or elapsing time, and whether these sequence representations generalize temporal relations across similar sequences. Here, participants mnemonically constructed times of events from multiple sequences using infrequent cues and their experience of passing time. After learning, event representations in the anterior hippocampus reflected temporal relations based on constructed times. Temporal relations were generalized across sequences, revealing distinct representational formats for events from the same or different sequences. Structural knowledge about time patterns, abstracted from different sequences, biased the construction of specific event times. These findings demonstrate that mnemonic construction and the generalization of relational knowledge combine in the hippocampus, consistent with the simulation of scenarios from episodic details and structural knowledge.","Activity patterns in the hippocampus resemble temporal relations of learned event sequences. Here, the authors show that these relational memories arise through mnemonic construction and are generalized to reflect the temporal event structure.",2022-06-23
1850,Macrocycle-stabilization of its interaction with 14-3-3 increases plasma membrane localization and activity of CFTR,"Impaired activity of the chloride channel CFTR is the cause of cystic fibrosis. 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to stabilize CFTR and increase its biogenesis and activity. Here, we report the identification and mechanism of action of a macrocycle stabilizing the 14-3-3/CFTR complex. This molecule rescues plasma membrane localization and chloride transport of F508del-CFTR and works additively with the CFTR pharmacological chaperone corrector lumacaftor (VX-809) and the triple combination Trikafta®. This macrocycle is a useful tool to study the CFTR/14-3-3 interaction and the potential of molecular glues in cystic fibrosis therapeutics.","Mutations in the chloride channel CFTR that impair plasma membrane insertion and ion transport are the cause of cystic fibrosis. Here, the authors identify a macrocycle that stabilizes the interaction of mutant CFTR with the chaperone-like protein 14-3-3 and rescues its biological function.",2022-06-23
1851,Probing TDP-43 condensation using an in silico designed aptamer,"Aptamers are artificial oligonucleotides binding to specific molecular targets. They have a promising role in therapeutics and diagnostics but are often difficult to design. Here, we exploited the catRAPID algorithm to generate aptamers targeting TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), whose aggregation is associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. On the pathway to forming insoluble inclusions, TDP-43 adopts a heterogeneous population of assemblies, many smaller than the diffraction-limit of light. We demonstrated that our aptamers bind TDP-43 and used the tightest interactor, Apt-1, as a probe to visualize TDP-43 condensates with super-resolution microscopy. At a resolution of 10 nanometers, we tracked TDP-43 oligomers undetectable by standard approaches. In cells, Apt-1 interacts with both diffuse and condensed forms of TDP-43, indicating that Apt-1 can be exploited to follow TDP-43 phase transition. The de novo generation of aptamers and their use for microscopy opens a new page to study protein condensation.","Here, the authors generated an artificial RNA molecule, or aptamer, specific for the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis protein TDP-43. By interacting avidly with its target, the aptamer can be exploited to track TDP-43 phase transition in vitro and in cells.",2022-06-23
1852,Bateman gradients from first principles,"In 1948, Angus Bateman presented experiments and concepts that remain influential and debated in sexual selection. The Bateman gradient relates reproductive success to mate number, and Bateman presented this as the cause of intra-masculine selection. A deeper causal level was subsequently asserted: that the ultimate cause of sex differences in Bateman gradients is the sex difference in gamete numbers, an argument that remains controversial and without mathematical backup. Here I develop models showing how asymmetry in gamete numbers alone can generate steeper Bateman gradients in males. This conclusion remains when the further asymmetry of internal fertilisation is added to the model and fertilisation is efficient. Strong gamete limitation can push Bateman gradients towards equality under external fertilisation and reverse them under internal fertilisation. Thus, this study provides a mathematical formalisation of Bateman’s brief verbal claim, while demonstrating that the link between gamete number and Bateman gradients is not inevitable nor trivial.","In 1948, Bateman asserted that sexual selection is driven by the sex difference in gamete numbers. Lehtonen presents mathematical models broadly validating this controversial claim, while pointing out selection can be reversed under some conditions.",2022-06-23
1853,Ecological networks of dissolved organic matter and microorganisms under global change,"Microbes regulate the composition and turnover of organic matter. Here we developed a framework called Energy-Diversity-Trait integrative Analysis to quantify how dissolved organic matter and microbes interact along global change drivers of temperature and nutrient enrichment. Negative and positive interactions suggest decomposition and production processes of organic matter, respectively. We applied this framework to manipulative field experiments on mountainsides in subarctic and subtropical climates. In both climates, negative interactions of bipartite networks were more specialized than positive interactions, showing fewer interactions between chemical molecules and bacterial taxa. Nutrient enrichment promoted specialization of positive interactions, but decreased specialization of negative interactions, indicating that organic matter was more vulnerable to decomposition by a greater range of bacteria, particularly at warmer temperatures in the subtropical climate. These two global change drivers influenced specialization of negative interactions most strongly via molecular traits, while molecular traits and bacterial diversity similarly affected specialization of positive interactions.",Microbes are intimately linked with the fate of organic matter. Here the authors develop an ecological network framework and show how microbes and dissolved organic matter interact along global change drivers of temperature and nutrient enrichment via manipulative field experiments on mountains.,2022-06-23
1854,hnRNPH1 recruits PTBP2 and SRSF3 to modulate alternative splicing in germ cells,"Coordinated regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing is essential for germ cell development. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that controls alternative mRNA expression during germ cell development remains elusive. Herein, we show that hnRNPH1 is highly expressed in the reproductive system and recruits the PTBP2 and SRSF3 to modulate the alternative splicing in germ cells. Conditional knockout Hnrnph1 in spermatogenic cells causes many abnormal splicing events, thus affecting the genes related to meiosis and communication between germ cells and Sertoli cells. This is characterized by asynapsis of chromosomes and impairment of germ-Sertoli communications, which ultimately leads to male sterility. Markedly, Hnrnph1 germline-specific mutant female mice are also infertile, and Hnrnph1-deficient oocytes exhibit a similar defective synapsis and cell-cell junction as seen in Hnrnph1-deficient male germ cells. Collectively, our data support a molecular model wherein hnRNPH1 governs a network of alternative splicing events in germ cells via recruitment of PTBP2 and SRSF3.","Coordinated regulation of alternative splicing is essential for germ cell development. Here, the authors report that hnRNPH1 interacts with alternative splicing factors PTBP2 and SRSF3 in the germline to regulate pre-mRNA alternative splicing.",2022-06-23
1855,HOX epimutations driven by maternal SMCHD1/LRIF1 haploinsufficiency trigger homeotic transformations in genetically wildtype offspring,"The body plan of animals is laid out by an evolutionary-conserved HOX code which is colinearly transcribed after zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Here we report that SMCHD1, a chromatin-modifying enzyme needed for X-inactivation in mammals, is maternally required for timely HOX expression. Using zebrafish and mouse Smchd1 knockout animals, we demonstrate that Smchd1 haplo-insufficiency brings about precocious and ectopic HOX transcription during oogenesis and embryogenesis. Unexpectedly, wild-type offspring born to heterozygous knockout zebrafish smchd1 mothers exhibited patent vertebrate patterning defects. The loss of maternal Smchd1 was accompanied by HOX epi-mutations driven by aberrant DNA methylation. We further show that this regulation is mediated by Lrif1, a direct interacting partner of Smchd1, whose knockout in zebrafish phenocopies that of Smchd1. Rather than being a short-lived maternal effect, HOX mis-regulation is stably inherited through cell divisions and persists in cultured fibroblasts derived from FSHD2 patients haploinsufficient for SMCHD1. We conclude that maternal SMCHD1/LRIF1 sets up an epigenetic state in the HOX loci that can only be reset in the germline. Such an unusual inter-generational inheritance, whereby a phenotype can be one generation removed from its genotype, casts a new light on how unresolved Mendelian diseases may be interpreted.","Hox genes are known to control anteroposterior patterning, including the vertebrate spine. Here Xue et al. show that maternal Smchd1 regulates Hox expression in an epigenetic manner, and that wild type offspring from heterozygous mothers show skeletal homeotic transformations as a result of this dysregulation.",2022-06-23
1856,Engineering substrate specificity of HAD phosphatases and multienzyme systems development for the thermodynamic-driven manufacturing sugars,"Naturally, haloacid dehalogenase superfamily phosphatases have been evolved with broad substrate promiscuity; however, strong specificity to a particular substrate is required for developing thermodynamically driven routes for manufacturing sugars. How to alter the intrinsic substrate promiscuity of phosphatases and fit the “one enzyme-one substrate” model remains a challenge. Herein, we report the structure-guided engineering of a phosphatase, and successfully provide variants with tailor-made preference for three widespread phosphorylated sugars, namely, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and mannose 6-phosphate, while simultaneously enhancement in catalytic efficiency. A 12000-fold switch from unfavorite substrate to dedicated one is generated. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the origin of improved activity and substrate specificity. Furthermore, we develop four coordinated multienzyme systems and accomplish the conversion of inexpensive sucrose and starch to fructose and mannose in excellent yield of 94–96%. This innovative sugar-biosynthesis strategy overcomes the reaction equilibrium of isomerization and provides the promise of high-yield manufacturing of other monosaccharides and polyols.",Haloacid dehalogenase-like phosphatases are widespread across all domains of life and play a crucial role in the regulation of levels of sugar phosphate metabolites in cells. The authors report on the structure-guided engineering of phosphatases for dedicated substrate specificity for the conversion of sucrose and starch into fructose and mannose.,2022-06-23
1857,Gut virome profiling identifies a widespread bacteriophage family associated with metabolic syndrome,"There is significant interest in altering the course of cardiometabolic disease development via gut microbiomes. Nevertheless, the highly abundant phage members of the complex gut ecosystem -which impact gut bacteria- remain understudied. Here, we show gut virome changes associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), a highly prevalent clinical condition preceding cardiometabolic disease, in 196 participants by combined sequencing of bulk whole genome and virus like particle communities. MetS gut viromes exhibit decreased richness and diversity. They are enriched in phages infecting Streptococcaceae and Bacteroidaceae and depleted in those infecting Bifidobacteriaceae. Differential abundance analysis identifies eighteen viral clusters (VCs) as significantly associated with either MetS or healthy viromes. Among these are a MetS-associated Roseburia VC that is related to healthy control-associated Faecalibacterium and Oscillibacter VCs. Further analysis of these VCs revealed the Candidatus Heliusviridae, a highly widespread gut phage lineage found in 90+% of participants. The identification of the temperate Ca. Heliusviridae provides a starting point to studies of phage effects on gut bacteria and the role that this plays in MetS.","Here, the authors characterize gut viromes in a cohort of individuals with metabolic syndrome, which they find associated with a highly widespread family of gut bacteriophages they name Candidatus Heliusviridae.",2022-06-23
1858,High stress twinning in a compositionally complex steel of very high stacking fault energy,"Deformation twinning is rarely found in bulk face-centered cubic (FCC) alloys with very high stacking fault energy (SFE) under standard loading conditions. Here, based on results from bulk quasi-static tensile experiments, we report deformation twinning in a micrometer grain-sized compositionally complex steel (CCS) with a very high SFE of ~79 mJ/m2, far above the SFE regime for twinning (<~50 mJ/m2) reported for FCC steels. The dual-nanoprecipitation, enabled by the compositional degrees of freedom, contributes to an ultrahigh true tensile stress up to 1.9 GPa in our CCS. The strengthening effect enhances the flow stress to reach the high critical value for the onset of mechanical twinning. The formation of nanotwins in turn enables further strain hardening and toughening mechanisms that enhance the mechanical performance. The high stress twinning effect introduces a so far untapped strengthening and toughening mechanism, for enabling the design of high SFEs alloys with improved mechanical properties.","Mechanical twinning is difficult to trigger in face centered cubic alloys with high stacking fault energies (SFEs) under standard tensile loading.

1859,Coiled-coil heterodimer-based recruitment of an exonuclease to CRISPR/Cas for enhanced gene editing,"The CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a powerful and versatile genome engineering tool, revolutionizing biological and biomedical sciences, where an improvement of efficiency could have a strong impact. Here we present a strategy to enhance gene editing based on the concerted action of Cas9 and an exonuclease. Non-covalent recruitment of exonuclease to Cas9/gRNA complex via genetically encoded coiled-coil based domains, termed CCExo, recruited the exonuclease to the cleavage site and robustly increased gene knock-out due to progressive DNA strand recession at the cleavage site, causing decreased re-ligation of the nonedited DNA. CCExo exhibited increased deletion size and enhanced gene inactivation efficiency in the context of several DNA targets, gRNA selection, Cas variants, tested cell lines and type of delivery. Targeting a sequence-specific oncogenic chromosomal translocation using CCExo in cells of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients and in an animal model led to the reduction or elimination of cancer, establishing it as a highly specific tool for treating CML and potentially other appropriate diseases with genetic etiology.","The CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a powerful and versatile genome engineering tool. Here the authors couple Cas9 to effector protein Exonuclease III via coiled-coil mediated interactions, termed CCExo, leading to increased deletion sizes and enhanced gene knock-out efficiencies in cell lines, primary cells and in vivo.",2022-06-23
1860,Advancing our understanding of genetic risk factors and potential personalized strategies for pelvic organ prolapse,"Pelvic organ prolapse is a common gynecological condition with limited understanding of its genetic background. In this work, we perform a genome-wide association meta-analysis comprising 28,086 cases and 546,291 controls from European ancestry. We identify 19 novel genome-wide significant loci, highlighting connective tissue, urogenital and cardiometabolic as likely affected systems. Here, we prioritize many genes of potential interest and assess shared genetic and phenotypic links. Additionally, we present the first polygenic risk score, which shows similar predictive ability (Harrell C-statistic (C-stat) 0.583, standard deviation (sd) = 0.007) as five established clinical risk factors combined (number of children, body mass index, ever smoked, constipation and asthma) (C-stat = 0.588, sd = 0.007) and demonstrates a substantial incremental value in combination with these (C-stat = 0.630, sd = 0.007). These findings improve our understanding of genetic factors underlying pelvic organ prolapse and provide a solid start evaluating polygenic risk scores as a potential tool to enhance individual risk prediction.","Although pelvic organ prolapse is a common gynecological condition, the genetic component of disease risk is not well known. Here the authors find common genetic variants associated with the disease and present a polygenic risk score to enhance individual risk prediction.",2022-06-23
1861,Dielectric magnetochiral anisotropy,"The combination of chirality and magnetism has steadily grown over the last decennia into an area of intense research. Magnetochiral anisotropy, chirality-induced spin-selectivity and helimagnetism are the most prominent phenomena resulting from this combination, touching different systems like topological (semi-)metals and insulators, quantum magnets, type II multiferroics and enantio-selective synthesis. As an extension to this area, we argue, based on symmetry arguments, that magnetochiral anisotropy will manifest itself in the displacement current in chiral dielectrics in a magnetic field. We confirm this conjecture by the experimental observation of very strong dielectric magnetochiral anisotropy near the ferroelectric phase transitions of triglycine sulfate and Rochelle salt, two of the oldest and most investigated chiral ferroelectrics. This effect opens a new playground in the study and characterisation of all chiral dielectrics. With our discovery, magnetochiral anisotropy now covers the (di)electrical properties of all condensed matter, from insulators to superconductors.","The interplay between chirality and magnetism has been attracting much. Here, the authors show that the movement of bound charges in a chiral dielectric depends on the relative orientation between this movement and an external magnetic field.",2022-06-22
1862,Branched actin networks are organized for asymmetric force production during clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells,"Actin assembly facilitates vesicle formation in several trafficking pathways, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Interestingly, actin does not assemble at all CME sites in mammalian cells. How actin networks are organized with respect to mammalian CME sites and how assembly forces are harnessed, are not fully understood. Here, branched actin network geometry at CME sites was analyzed using three different advanced imaging approaches. When endocytic dynamics of unperturbed CME sites are compared, sites with actin assembly show a distinct signature, a delay between completion of coat expansion and vesicle scission, indicating that actin assembly occurs preferentially at stalled CME sites. In addition, N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex are recruited to one side of CME sites, where they are positioned to stimulate asymmetric actin assembly and force production. We propose that actin assembles preferentially at stalled CME sites where it pulls vesicles into the cell asymmetrically, much as a bottle opener pulls off a bottle cap.","Drubin et al. use three different advanced imaging approaches to show that actin assembles preferentially at stalled clathrin-mediated endocytosis sites, where the actin pulls vesicles into the cell asymmetrically, as a bottle opener pulls off a cap.",2022-06-22
1863,Near-ideal electromechanical coupling in textured piezoelectric ceramics,"Electromechanical coupling factor, k, of piezoelectric materials determines the conversion efficiency of mechanical to electrical energy or electrical to mechanical energy. Here, we provide an fundamental approach to design piezoelectric materials that provide near-ideal magnitude of k, via exploiting the electrocrystalline anisotropy through fabrication of grain-oriented or textured ceramics. Coupled phase field simulation and experimental investigation on <001> textured Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 ceramics illustrate that k can reach same magnitude as that for a single crystal, far beyond the average value of traditional ceramics. To provide atomistic-scale understanding of our approach, we employ a theoretical model to determine the physical origin of k in perovskite ferroelectrics and find that strong covalent bonding between B-site cation and oxygen via d-p hybridization contributes most towards the magnitude of k. This demonstration of near-ideal k value in textured ceramics will have tremendous impact on design of ultra-wide bandwidth, high efficiency, high power density, and high stability piezoelectric devices.","“k” is the electromechanical coupling factor, and determines the efficiency of conversion between electrical and mechanical energy or vice-versa in piezoelectric materials. Here, Yan et al. present an optimization strategy for “k” via texturing and covalency tuning that results in “k” values comparable to that of single crystals.",2022-06-22
1864,Host control and the evolution of cooperation in host microbiomes,"Humans, and many other species, are host to diverse symbionts. It is often suggested that the mutual benefits of host-microbe relationships can alone explain cooperative evolution. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis with evolutionary modelling. Our model predicts that mutual benefits are insufficient to drive cooperation in systems like the human microbiome, because of competition between symbionts. However, cooperation can emerge if hosts can exert control over symbionts, so long as there are constraints that limit symbiont counter evolution. We test our model with genomic data of two bacterial traits monitored by animal immune systems. In both cases, bacteria have evolved as predicted under host control, tending to lose flagella and maintain butyrate production when host-associated. Moreover, an analysis of bacteria that retain flagella supports the evolution of host control, via toll-like receptor 5, which limits symbiont counter evolution. Our work puts host control mechanisms, including the immune system, at the centre of microbiome evolution.","Humans, and many other species, carry a large set of beneficial microbes. Here, the authors present new theory and data to argue that these vital relationships only work when hosts can control their microbiome and suppress wayward symbionts.",2022-06-22
1865,RNase III-CLASH of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus reveals a regulatory mRNA 3′UTR required for intermediate vancomycin resistance,"Treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections is dependent on the efficacy of last-line antibiotics including vancomycin. Treatment failure is commonly linked to isolates with intermediate vancomycin resistance (termed VISA). These isolates have accumulated point mutations that collectively reduce vancomycin sensitivity, often by thickening the cell wall. Changes in regulatory small RNA expression have been correlated with antibiotic stress in VISA isolates however the functions of most RNA regulators is unknown. Here we capture RNA–RNA interactions associated with RNase III using CLASH. RNase III-CLASH uncovers hundreds of novel RNA–RNA interactions in vivo allowing functional characterisation of many sRNAs for the first time. Surprisingly, many mRNA–mRNA interactions are recovered and we find that an mRNA encoding a long 3′ untranslated region (UTR) (termed vigR 3′UTR) functions as a regulatory ‘hub’ within the RNA–RNA interaction network. We demonstrate that the vigR 3′UTR promotes expression of folD and the cell wall lytic transglycosylase isaA through direct mRNA–mRNA base-pairing. Deletion of the vigR 3′UTR re-sensitised VISA to glycopeptide treatment and both isaA and vigR 3′UTR deletions impact cell wall thickness. Our results demonstrate the utility of RNase III-CLASH and indicate that S. aureus uses mRNA-mRNA interactions to co-ordinate gene expression more widely than previously appreciated.","Regulatory small RNA (sRNA) interact with mRNAs to regulate their stability, transcription, and translation via diverse mechanisms. Here, Mediati et al. apply RNase III-CLASH to multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to characterise the network of RNA–RNA interactions associated with RNase III and identify a regulatory mRNA 3′UTR, named vigR-3′UTR, involved in the regulation of genes relevant for vancomycin sensitivity.",2022-06-22
1866,Pixel super-resolution with spatially entangled photons,"Pixelation occurs in many imaging systems and limits the spatial resolution of the acquired images. This effect is notably present in quantum imaging experiments with correlated photons in which the number of pixels used to detect coincidences is often limited by the sensor technology or the acquisition speed. Here, we introduce a pixel super-resolution technique based on measuring the full spatially-resolved joint probability distribution (JPD) of spatially-entangled photons. Without shifting optical elements or using prior information, our technique increases the pixel resolution of the imaging system by a factor two and enables retrieval of spatial information lost due to undersampling. We demonstrate its use in various quantum imaging protocols using photon pairs, including quantum illumination, entanglement-enabled quantum holography, and in a full-field version of N00N-state quantum holography. The JPD pixel super-resolution technique can benefit any full-field imaging system limited by the sensor spatial resolution, including all already established and future photon-correlation-based quantum imaging schemes, bringing these techniques closer to real-world applications.","Pixelation is common in quantum imaging systems and limit the image spatial resolution. Here, the authors introduce a pixel super-resolution approach based on measuring the full spatially-resolved joint probability distribution of spatially-entangled photons, and improve pixel resolution by a factor two.",2022-06-22
1867,Trapping and detecting nanoplastics by MXene-derived oxide microrobots,"Nanoplastic pollution, the final product of plastic waste fragmentation in the environment, represents an increasing concern for the scientific community due to the easier diffusion and higher hazard associated with their small sizes. Therefore, there is a pressing demand for effective strategies to quantify and remove nanoplastics in wastewater. This work presents the “on-the-fly” capture of nanoplastics in the three-dimensional (3D) space by multifunctional MXene-derived oxide microrobots and their further detection. A thermal annealing process is used to convert Ti3C2Tx MXene into photocatalytic multi-layered TiO2, followed by the deposition of a Pt layer and the decoration with magnetic γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The MXene-derived γ-Fe2O3/Pt/TiO2 microrobots show negative photogravitaxis, resulting in a powerful fuel-free motion with six degrees of freedom under light irradiation. Owing to the unique combination of self-propulsion and programmable Zeta potential, the microrobots can quickly attract and trap nanoplastics on their surface, including the slits between multi-layer stacks, allowing their magnetic collection. Utilized as self-motile preconcentration platforms, they enable nanoplastics’ electrochemical detection using low-cost and portable electrodes. This proof-of-concept study paves the way toward the “on-site” screening of nanoplastics in water and its successive remediation.","Nanoplastic water pollution represents an increasing concern. Here, photogravitactic MXene-derived microrobots are programmed to trap nanoplastics in the layered structure and magnetically transfer them to low-cost electrodes for further detection.",2022-06-22
1868,Cooperative chalcogen bonding interactions in confined sites activate aziridines,"The activation of aziridines typically involves the use of strong Lewis acids or transition metals, and methods relying on weak interactions are rare. Herein, we report that cooperative chalcogen bonding interactions in confined sites can activate sulfonyl-protected aziridines. Among the several possible distinct bonding modes, our experiments and computational studies suggest that an activation mode involving the cooperative Se···O and Se···N interactions is in operation. The catalytic reactions between weakly bonded supramolecular species and nonactivated alkenes are considered as unfavorable approaches. However, here we show that the activation of aziridines by cooperative Se···O and Se···N interactions enables the cycloaddition of weakly bonded aziridine-selenide complex with nonactivated alkenes in a catalytic manner. Thus, weak interactions can indeed enable these transformations and are an alternative to methods relying on strong Lewis acids.","The activation of aziridines is typically achieved via reaction with strong Lewis acids or transition metals. Here, the authors report that cooperative Se ∙ ∙∙O and Se ∙ ∙∙N noncovalent interactions can activate sulfonyl-protected aziridines, which enables their use in cycloaddition reactions with nonactivated alkenes.",2022-06-22
1869,Nano- to macro-scale control of 3D printed materials via polymerization induced microphase separation,"Although 3D printing allows the macroscopic structure of objects to be easily controlled, controlling the nanostructure of 3D printed materials has rarely been reported. Herein, we report an efficient and versatile process for fabricating 3D printed materials with controlled nanoscale structural features. This approach uses resins containing macromolecular chain transfer agents (macroCTAs) which microphase separate during the photoinduced 3D printing process to form nanostructured materials. By varying the chain length of the macroCTA, we demonstrate a high level of control over the microphase separation behavior, resulting in materials with controllable nanoscale sizes and morphologies. Importantly, the bulk mechanical properties of 3D printed objects are correlated with their morphologies; transitioning from discrete globular to interpenetrating domains results in a marked improvement in mechanical performance, which is ascribed to the increased interfacial interaction between soft and hard domains. Overall, the findings of this work enable the simplified production of materials with tightly controllable nanostructures for broad potential applications.","3D printing allows the macroscopic structure of objects to be easily controlled but controlling the nanostructure of 3D printed materials has rarely been reported. Here, the authors report an efficient and versatile process for fabricating 3D printed materials with controlled nano-scale structural features.",2022-06-22
1870,Dissociation between individual differences in self-reported pain intensity and underlying fMRI brain activation,"Pain is an individual experience. Previous studies have highlighted changes in brain activation and morphology associated with within- and interindividual pain perception. In this study we sought to characterize brain mechanisms associated with between-individual differences in pain in a sample of healthy adolescent and adult participants (N = 101). Here we show that pain ratings varied widely across individuals and that individuals reported changes in pain evoked by small differences in stimulus intensity in a manner congruent with their pain sensitivity, further supporting the utility of subjective reporting as a measure of the true individual experience. Furthermore, brain activation related to interindividual differences in pain was not detected, despite clear sensitivity of the Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal to small differences in noxious stimulus intensities within individuals. These findings suggest fMRI may not be a useful objective measure to infer reported pain intensity.",Previous work had suggested that fMRI measures can be used as a marker of pain experience. Here the authors find no evidence for a link between perceived pain intensity and fMRI activation.,2022-06-22
1871,High-resolution mass measurements of single budding yeast reveal linear growth segments,"The regulation of cell growth has fundamental physiological, biotechnological and medical implications. However, methods that can continuously monitor individual cells at sufficient mass and time resolution hardly exist. Particularly, detecting the mass of individual microbial cells, which are much smaller than mammalian cells, remains challenging. Here, we modify a previously described cell balance (‘picobalance’) to monitor the proliferation of single cells of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, under culture conditions in real time. Combined with optical microscopy to monitor the yeast morphology and cell cycle phase, the picobalance approaches a total mass resolution of 0.45 pg. Our results show that single budding yeast cells (S/G2/M phase) increase total mass in multiple linear segments sequentially, switching their growth rates. The growth rates weakly correlate with the cell mass of the growth segments, and the duration of each growth segment correlates negatively with cell mass. We envision that our technology will be useful for direct, accurate monitoring of the growth of single cells throughout their cycle.","Measuring the mass of individual microbial cells remains challenging. Here, the authors present a cell balance to monitor the proliferation of single budding yeast cells under culture conditions in real time, showing that single cells increase total mass in multiple linear segments of constant growth rates.",2022-06-22
1872,RNase III CLASH in MRSA uncovers sRNA regulatory networks coupling metabolism to toxin expression,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterial pathogen responsible for significant human morbidity and mortality. Post-transcriptional regulation by small RNAs (sRNAs) has emerged as an important mechanism for controlling virulence. However, the functionality of the majority of sRNAs during infection is unknown. To address this, we performed UV cross-linking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) in MRSA to identify sRNA-RNA interactions under conditions that mimic the host environment. Using a double-stranded endoribonuclease III as bait, we uncovered hundreds of novel sRNA-RNA pairs. Strikingly, our results suggest that the production of small membrane-permeabilizing toxins is under extensive sRNA-mediated regulation and that their expression is intimately connected to metabolism. Additionally, we also uncover an sRNA sponging interaction between RsaE and RsaI. Taken together, we present a comprehensive analysis of sRNA-target interactions in MRSA and provide details on how these contribute to the control of virulence in response to changes in metabolism.","Regulatory small RNA (sRNA) interact with mRNAs to regulate their stability, transcription, and translation via diverse mechanisms. Here, McKellar et al. apply RNase IIICLASH of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus under different culture conditions to link the network of RNA-RNA interactions to environmental conditions and find that the production of small membrane-permeabilizing toxins is strongly regulated by sRNAs.",2022-06-22
1873,Geometry-independent antenna based on Epsilon-near-zero medium,"It is well known that electromagnetic radiation from radiating elements (e.g., antennas, apertures, etc.) shows dependence on the element’s geometry shape in terms of operating frequencies. This basic principle is ubiquitous in the design of radiators in multiple applications spanning from microwave, to optics and plasmonics. The emergence of epsilon-near-zero media exceptionally allows for an infinite wavelength of electromagnetic waves, manifesting exotic spatially-static wave dynamics which is not dependent on geometry. In this work, we analyze theoretically and verify experimentally such geometry-independent features for radiation, thus presenting a novel class of radiating resonators, i.e., antennas, with an operating frequency irrelevant to the geometry shape while only determined by the host material’s dispersions. Despite being translated into different shapes and topologies, the designed epsilon-near-zero antenna resonates at a same frequency, while exhibiting very different far-field radiation patterns, with beams varying from wide to narrow, or even from single to multiple. Additionally, the photonic doping technique is employed to facilitate the high-efficiency radiation. The material-determined geometry-independent radiation may lead to numerous applications in flexible design and manufacturing for wireless communications, sensing, and wavefront engineering.","This paper proposes an unconventional type of antennas that are composed by epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) media. The operating frequencies of such antennas are independent of their geometries, and are determined by material dispersion.",2022-06-22
1874,Meeting sustainable development goals via robotics and autonomous systems,"Robotics and autonomous systems are reshaping the world, changing healthcare, food production and biodiversity management. While they will play a fundamental role in delivering the UN Sustainable Development Goals, associated opportunities and threats are yet to be considered systematically. We report on a horizon scan evaluating robotics and autonomous systems impact on all Sustainable Development Goals, involving 102 experts from around the world. Robotics and autonomous systems are likely to transform how the Sustainable Development Goals are achieved, through replacing and supporting human activities, fostering innovation, enhancing remote access and improving monitoring. Emerging threats relate to reinforcing inequalities, exacerbating environmental change, diverting resources from tried-and-tested solutions and reducing freedom and privacy through inadequate governance. Although predicting future impacts of robotics and autonomous systems on the Sustainable Development Goals is difficult, thoroughly examining technological developments early is essential to prevent unintended detrimental consequences. Additionally, robotics and autonomous systems should be considered explicitly when developing future iterations of the Sustainable Development Goals to avoid reversing progress or exacerbating inequalities.",A horizon scan was used to explore possible impacts of robotics and automated systems on achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Positive effects are likely. Iterative regulatory processes and continued dialogue could help avoid environmental damages and increases in inequality.,2022-06-21
1875,A bioinspired sequential energy transfer system constructed via supramolecular copolymerization,"Sequential energy transfer is ubiquitous in natural light harvesting systems to make full use of solar energy. Although various artificial systems have been developed with the biomimetic sequential energy transfer character, most of them exhibit the overall energy transfer efficiency lower than 70% due to the disordered organization of donor/acceptor chromophores. Herein a sequential energy transfer system is constructed via supramolecular copolymerization of σ-platinated (hetero)acenes, by taking inspiration from the natural light harvesting of green photosynthetic bacteria. The absorption and emission transitions of the three designed σ-platinated (hetero)acenes range from visible to NIR region through structural variation. Structural similarity of these monomers faciliates supramolecular copolymerization in apolar media via the nucleation-elongation mechanism. The resulting supramolecular copolymers display long diffusion length of excitation energy (> 200 donor units) and high exciton migration rates (~1014 L mol−1 s−1), leading to an overall sequential energy transfer efficiency of 87.4% for the ternary copolymers. The superior properties originate from the dense packing of σ-platinated (hetero)acene monomers in supramolecular copolymers, mimicking the aggregation mode of bacteriochlorophyll pigments in green photosynthetic bacteria. Overall, directional supramolecular copolymerization of donor/acceptor chromophores with high energy transfer efficiency would provide new avenues toward artificial photosynthesis applications.","Sequential energy transfer is ubiquitous in natural light harvesting systems, but most artificial mimics have unsatisfactory energy transfer efficiency. Here, authors synthesize a sequential energy transfer system with overall efficiency of 87.4% via supramolecular copolymerization mimicking the aggregation mode of bacteriochlorophyll pigments in green photosynthetic bacteria.",2022-06-21
1876,Decoupling the electronic and geometric effects of Pt catalysts in selective hydrogenation reaction,"Decoupling the electronic and geometric effects has been a long cherished goal for heterogeneous catalysis due to their tangled relationship. Here, a novel orthogonal decomposition method is firstly proposed to settle this issue in p-chloronitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction on size- and shape-controlled Pt nanoparticles (NPs) carried on various supports. Results suggest Fermi levels of catalysts can be modulated by supports with varied work function (Wf). And the selectivity on Pt NPs of similar size and shape is linearly related with the Wf of support. Optimized Fermi levels of the catalysts with large Wf weaken the ability of Pt NPs to fill valence electrons into the antibonding orbital of C–Cl bond, finally suppressing the hydrodehalogenation side reaction. Foremost, the geometric effect is firstly spun off through orthogonal relation based on series of linear relationships over various sizes of Pt NPs reflecting the electronic effect. Moreover, separable nested double coordinate system is established to quantitatively evaluate the two effects.",Decoupling the electronic and geometric effects has been a long cherished goal for heterogeneous catalysis due to their tangled relationship. Here the authors propose a novel orthogonal decomposition method to decouple the electronic and geometric effect for supported metal catalysts.,2022-06-21
1877,The antenna of far-red absorbing cyanobacteria increases both absorption and quantum efficiency of Photosystem II,"Cyanobacteria carry out photosynthetic light-energy conversion using phycobiliproteins for light harvesting and the chlorophyll-rich photosystems for photochemistry. While most cyanobacteria only absorb visible photons, some of them can acclimate to harvest far-red light (FRL, 700–800 nm) by integrating chlorophyll f and d in their photosystems and producing red-shifted allophycocyanin. Chlorophyll f insertion enables the photosystems to use FRL but slows down charge separation, reducing photosynthetic efficiency. Here we demonstrate with time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy that on average charge separation in chlorophyll-f-containing Photosystem II becomes faster in the presence of red-shifted allophycocyanin antennas. This is different from all known photosynthetic systems, where additional light-harvesting complexes increase the overall absorption cross section but slow down charge separation. This remarkable property can be explained with the available structural and spectroscopic information. The unique design is probably important for these cyanobacteria to efficiently switch between visible and far-red light.",Some cyanobacteria acclimate to far-red light by integrating chlorophyll f into their photosystems. Additional chlorophylls typically slow down charge separation but here the authors show that charge separation in chlorophyll-f-containing Photosystem II is faster in the presence of red-shifted allophycocyanin antennas.,2022-06-21
1878,NANOG initiates epiblast fate through the coordination of pluripotency genes expression,"The epiblast is the source of all mammalian embryonic tissues and of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. It differentiates alongside the primitive endoderm in a “salt and pepper” pattern from inner cell mass (ICM) progenitors during the preimplantation stages through the activity of NANOG, GATA6 and the FGF pathway. When and how epiblast lineage specification is initiated is still unclear. Here, we show that the coordinated expression of pluripotency markers defines epiblast identity. Conversely, ICM progenitor cells display random cell-to-cell variability in expression of various pluripotency markers, remarkably dissimilar from the epiblast signature and independently from NANOG, GATA6 and FGF activities. Coordination of pluripotency markers expression fails in Nanog and Gata6 double KO (DKO) embryos. Collectively, our data suggest that NANOG triggers epiblast specification by ensuring the coordinated expression of pluripotency markers in a subset of cells, implying a stochastic mechanism. These features are likely conserved, as suggested by analysis of human embryos.","Pluripotent epiblast cells segregate from primitive endoderm in the blastocyst inner cell mass (ICM). Here the authors show that mosaic epiblast differentiation during mouse and human preimplantation development initiates stochastically in ICM progenitors, independently of the FGF pathway, and requires NANOG activity",2022-06-21
1879,A multi-ethnic polygenic risk score is associated with hypertension prevalence and progression throughout adulthood,"In a multi-stage analysis of 52,436 individuals aged 17-90 across diverse cohorts and biobanks, we train, test, and evaluate a polygenic risk score (PRS) for hypertension risk and progression. The PRS is trained using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and hypertension, respectively. For each trait, PRS is selected by optimizing the coefficient of variation (CV) across estimated effect sizes from multiple potential PRS using the same GWAS, after which the 3 trait-specific PRSs are combined via an unweighted sum called “PRSsum”, forming the HTN-PRS. The HTN-PRS is associated with both prevalent and incident hypertension at 4-6 years of follow up. This association is further confirmed in age-stratified analysis. In an independent biobank of 40,201 individuals, the HTN-PRS is confirmed to be predictive of increased risk for coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.","Polygenic risk scores have potential to predict an individual’s risk of disease based on genetic markers. Here, the authors develop a polygenic risk score for hypertension and test it in a multi-ethnic cohort, finding that the score is associated with higher likelihood of hypertension development 4-6 years later.",2022-06-21
1880,"Strong, tough, ionic conductive, and freezing-tolerant all-natural hydrogel enabled by cellulose-bentonite coordination interactions","Ionic conductive hydrogels prepared from naturally abundant cellulose are ideal candidates for constructing flexible electronics from the perspective of commercialization and environmental sustainability. However, cellulosic hydrogels featuring both high mechanical strength and ionic conductivity remain extremely challenging to achieve because the ionic charge carriers tend to destroy the hydrogen-bonding network among cellulose. Here we propose a supramolecular engineering strategy to boost the mechanical performance and ionic conductivity of cellulosic hydrogels by incorporating bentonite (BT) via the strong cellulose-BT coordination interaction and the ion regulation capability of the nanoconfined cellulose-BT intercalated nanostructure. A strong (compressive strength up to 3.2 MPa), tough (fracture energy up to 0.45 MJ m−3), yet highly ionic conductive and freezing tolerant (high ionic conductivities of 89.9 and 25.8 mS cm−1 at 25 and −20 °C, respectively) all-natural cellulose-BT hydrogel is successfully realized. These findings open up new perspectives for the design of cellulosic hydrogels and beyond.","Cellulose based ion conductive hydrogels are emerging materials for application in flexible electronics but achieving simultaneously high conductivity and good mechanical properties remains challenging.

1881,Pleistocene drivers of Northwest African hydroclimate and vegetation,"Savanna ecosystems were the landscapes for human evolution and are vital to modern Sub-Saharan African food security, yet the fundamental drivers of climate and ecology in these ecosystems remain unclear. Here we generate plant-wax isotope and dust flux records to explore the mechanistic drivers of the Northwest African monsoon, and to assess ecosystem responses to changes in monsoon rainfall and atmospheric pCO2. We show that monsoon rainfall is controlled by low-latitude insolation gradients and that while increases in precipitation are associated with expansion of grasslands into desert landscapes, changes in pCO2 predominantly drive the C3/C4 composition of savanna ecosystems.","Plant-wax isotope and dust flux records reveal that the long-term variability of the Northwest African monsoon is controlled by tropical solar radiation gradients. Grasslands expand into the Sahara during strong monsoons, but the ultimate composition of the ecosystem is controlled by CO2.",2022-06-21
1882,"Binding and structural basis of equine ACE2 to RBDs from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses","The origin and host range of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are important scientific questions as they might provide insight into understanding of the potential future spillover to infect humans. Here, we tested the binding between equine angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (eqACE2) and the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 prototype (PT) and variant of concerns (VOCs), as well as their close relatives bat-origin coronavirus (CoV) RaTG13 and pangolin-origin CoVs GX/P2V/2017 and GD/1/2019. We also determined the crystal structures of eqACE2/RaTG13-RBD, eqACE2/SARS-CoV-2 PT-RBD and eqACE2/Omicron BA.1-RBD. We identified S494 of SARS-COV-2 PT-RBD as an important residue in the eqACE2/SARS-COV-2 PT-RBD interaction and found that N501Y, the commonly recognized enhancing mutation, attenuated the binding affinity with eqACE2. Our work demonstrates that horses are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 and highlights the importance of continuous surveillance on SARS-CoV-2 and related CoVs to prevent spillover events.","This study documents equine ACE2 (eqACE2) binding to the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and related CoVs, revealing a mechanism of eqACE2 binding with RaTG13-RBD, SARS-CoV-2 prototype-RBD and Omicron BA.1-RBD.",2022-06-21
1883,Kir2.1-mediated membrane potential promotes nutrient acquisition and inflammation through regulation of nutrient transporters,"Immunometabolism contributes to inflammation, but how activated macrophages acquire extracellular nutrients to fuel inflammation is largely unknown. Here, we show that the plasma membrane potential (Vm) of macrophages mediated by Kir2.1, an inwardly-rectifying K+ channel, is an important determinant of nutrient acquisition and subsequent metabolic reprogramming promoting inflammation. In the absence of Kir2.1 activity, depolarized macrophage Vm lead to a caloric restriction state by limiting nutrient uptake and concomitant adaptations in nutrient conservation inducing autophagy, AMPK (Adenosine 5‘-monophosphate-activated protein kinase), and GCN2 (General control nonderepressible 2), which subsequently depletes epigenetic substrates feeding histone methylation at loci of a cluster of metabolism-responsive inflammatory genes, thereby suppressing their transcription. Kir2.1-mediated Vm supports nutrient uptake by facilitating cell-surface retention of nutrient transporters such as 4F2hc and GLUT1 by its modulation of plasma membrane phospholipid dynamics. Pharmacological targeting of Kir2.1 alleviated inflammation triggered by LPS or bacterial infection in a sepsis model and sterile inflammation in human samples. These findings identify an ionic control of macrophage activation and advance our understanding of the immunomodulatory properties of Vm that links nutrient inputs to inflammatory diseases.",Potassium channels and membrane potential may influence macrophage function during inflammation. Here the authors show that the Kir2.1 potassium channel affects macrophage metabolism by altering cell surface retention of nutrient transporters and subsequently regulates inflammatory disease responses.,2022-06-21
1884,Islet autoantibody seroconversion in type-1 diabetes is associated with metagenome-assembled genomes in infant gut microbiomes,"The immune system of some genetically susceptible children can be triggered by certain environmental factors to produce islet autoantibodies (IA) against pancreatic β cells, which greatly increases their risk for Type-1 diabetes. An environmental factor under active investigation is the gut microbiome due to its important role in immune system education. Here, we study gut metagenomes that are de-novo-assembled in 887 at-risk children in the Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) project. Our results reveal a small set of core protein families, present in >50% of the subjects, which account for 64% of the sequencing reads. Time-series binning generates 21,536 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 883 species, including 176 species that hitherto have no MAG representation in previous comprehensive human microbiome surveys. IA seroconversion is positively associated with 2373 MAGs and negatively with 1549 MAGs. Comparative genomics analysis identifies lipopolysaccharides biosynthesis in Bacteroides MAGs and sulfate reduction in Anaerostipes MAGs as functional signatures of MAGs with positive IA-association. The functional signatures in the MAGs with negative IA-association include carbohydrate degradation in lactic acid bacteria MAGs and nitrate reduction in Escherichia MAGs. Overall, our results show a distinct set of gut microorganisms associated with IA seroconversion and uncovered the functional genomics signatures of these IA-associated microorganisms","Here, by characterizing gut metagenomes of at-risk children in the TEDDY project, the authors associate onset of autoimmunity leading to Type-1 diabetes with certain sets of microorganisms in the gut microbiota, and identify metabolic capabilities encoded in the genomes of these microorganisms that provide functional insights to the association.",2022-06-21
1885,Defining the substrate envelope of SARS-CoV-2 main protease to predict and avoid drug resistance,"Coronaviruses can evolve and spread rapidly to cause severe disease morbidity and mortality, as exemplified by SARS-CoV-2 variants of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although currently available vaccines remain mostly effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants, additional treatment strategies are needed. Inhibitors that target essential viral enzymes, such as proteases and polymerases, represent key classes of antivirals. However, clinical use of antiviral therapies inevitably leads to emergence of drug resistance. In this study we implemented a strategy to pre-emptively address drug resistance to protease inhibitors targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, an essential enzyme that promotes viral maturation. We solved nine high-resolution cocrystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro bound to substrate peptides and six structures with cleavage products. These structures enabled us to define the substrate envelope of Mpro, map the critical recognition elements, and identify evolutionarily vulnerable sites that may be susceptible to resistance mutations that would compromise binding of the newly developed Mpro inhibitors. Our results suggest strategies for developing robust inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 that will retain longer-lasting efficacy against this evolving viral pathogen.",The authors determined crystal structures of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 bound to substrate peptides.

1886,MicroRNA-21 promotes pancreatic β cell function through modulating glucose uptake,"Pancreatic β cell dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. MiR-21 has been shown to be induced in the islets of glucose intolerant patients and type 2 diabetic mice. However, the role of miR-21 in the regulation of pancreatic β cell function remains largely elusive. In the current study, we identify the pathway by which miR-21 regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion utilizing mice lacking miR-21 in their β cells (miR-21βKO). We find that miR-21βKO mice develop glucose intolerance due to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Mechanistic studies reveal that miR-21 enhances glucose uptake and subsequently promotes insulin secretion by up-regulating Glut2 expression in a miR-21-Pdcd4-AP-1 dependent pathway. Over-expression of Glut2 in knockout islets results in rescue of the impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that delivery of miR-21 into the pancreas of type 2 diabetic db/db male mice is able to promote Glut2 expression and reduce blood glucose level. Taking together, our results reveal that miR-21 in islet β cell promotes insulin secretion and support a role for miR-21 in the regulation of pancreatic β cell function in type 2 diabetes.","The microRNA miR-21 is induced in the islets of patients with glucose intolerance and diabetic mice.

1887,A forward Brillouin fibre laser,"Fibre lasers based on backward stimulated Brillouin scattering provide narrow linewidths and serve in signal processing and sensing applications. Stimulated Brillouin scattering in fibres takes place in the forward direction as well, with amplification bandwidths that are narrower by two orders of magnitude. However, forward Brillouin lasers have yet to be realized in any fibre platform. In this work, we report a first forward Brillouin fibre laser, using a bare off-the-shelf, panda-type polarisation maintaining fibre. Pump light in one principal axis provides Brillouin amplification for a co-propagating lasing signal of the orthogonal polarisation. Feedback is provided by Bragg gratings at both ends of the fibre cavity. Single-mode, few-modes and multi-mode regimes of operation are observed. The lasing threshold exhibits a unique environmental sensitivity: it is elevated when the fibre is partially immersed in water due to the broadening of forward Brillouin scattering spectra. The results establish a new type of fibre laser, with potential for ultra-high coherence and precision sensing of media outside the cladding.","Highly-coherent and narrow linewidth fibre lasers are determinant in several sensing techniques.

1888,"A scalable, open-source implementation of a large-scale mechanistic model for single cell proliferation and death signaling","Mechanistic models of how single cells respond to different perturbations can help integrate disparate big data sets or predict response to varied drug combinations. However, the construction and simulation of such models have proved challenging. Here, we developed a python-based model creation and simulation pipeline that converts a few structured text files into an SBML standard and is high-performance- and cloud-computing ready. We applied this pipeline to our large-scale, mechanistic pan-cancer signaling model (named SPARCED) and demonstrate it by adding an IFNγ pathway submodel. We then investigated whether a putative crosstalk mechanism could be consistent with experimental observations from the LINCS MCF10A Data Cube that IFNγ acts as an anti-proliferative factor. The analyses suggested this observation can be explained by IFNγ-induced SOCS1 sequestering activated EGF receptors. This work forms a foundational recipe for increased mechanistic model-based data integration on a single-cell level, an important building block for clinically-predictive mechanistic models.","Mechanistic models of how single cells respond to different perturbations can help integrate disparate big data sets or predict response to varied drug combinations.

Although considerable progress has increased our understanding of the biological and clinical aspects of C. auris, its interaction with the host immune system is only now beginning to be investigated in-depth. Here, we compare the innate immune responses induced by C. auris BJCA001 and Candida albicans SC5314 in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that C. auris BJCA001 appears to be less immunoinflammatory than C. albicans SC5314, and this differential response correlates with structural features of the cell wall.","Candida auris is a multidrug-resistant human fungal pathogen responsible for nosocomial outbreaks worldwide.

Herein we report a novel chiral dual-emissive bismacrocycle with tunable aggregation-induced emission colors. A facile four-step synthesis strategy is developed to construct this rigid bismacrocycle, (1,4)[8]cycloparaphenylenophane (SCPP[8]), which possesses a 1,2,4,5-tetraphenylbenzene core locked by two intersecting polyphenylene-based macrocycles. The luminescent behavior of SCPP[8] shows the unique characteristics of both ACQ effect and AIE effect, inducing remarkable redshift emission with near white-light emission. SCPP[8] is configurationally stable and possesses a novel shape-persistent bismacrocycle scaffold with a high strain energy. In addition, SCPP[8] displays enhanced circularly polarized luminescence properties due to AIE effect.","Organic materials with both aggregation induced emission (AIE) and aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effects that can emit with multiple wavelengths in the solution and aggregated state are rarely reported.

1891,A trefoil knot self-templated through imination in water,"The preparation of topologically nontrivial molecules is often assisted by covalent, supramolecular or coordinative templates that provide spatial pre-organization for all components. Herein, we report a trefoil knot that can be self-assembled efficiently in water without involving additional templates. The direct condensation of three equivalents of a tetraformyl precursor and six equivalents of a chiral diamine produces successfully a [3 + 6] trefoil knot whose intrinsic handedness is dictated by the stereochemical configuration of the diamine linkers. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that imine condensation is not amenable to use in water, the multivalent cooperativity between all the imine bonds within the framework makes this trefoil knot robust in the aqueous environment. Furthermore, the presence of water is proven to be essential for the trefoil knot formation. A topologically trivial macrocycle composed of two tetraformyl and four diamino building blocks is obtained when a similar reaction is performed in organic media, indicating that hydrophobic effect is a major driving force behind the scene.","The self-assembly of molecular knots in water is challenging. Here, authors report the self-assembly of a trefoil knot in water via imine condensation, without relying on external templates; the handedness of the trefoil knot is determined by the chirality of the bisamino precursor.",2022-06-21
1892,Cyclic microchip assay for measurement of hundreds of functional proteins in single neurons,"Despite the fact that proteins carry out nearly all cellular functions and mark the differences of cells, the existing single-cell tools can only analyze dozens of proteins, a scale far from full characterization of cells and tissue yet. Herein, we present a single-cell cyclic multiplex in situ tagging (CycMIST) technology that affords the comprehensive functional proteome profiling of single cells. We demonstrate the technology by detecting 182 proteins that include surface markers, neuron function proteins, neurodegeneration markers, signaling pathway proteins, and transcription factors. Further studies on cells derived from the 5XFAD mice, an Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) model, validate the utility of our technology and reveal the deep heterogeneity of brain cells. Through comparison with control mouse cells, we have identified differentially expressed proteins in AD pathology. Our technology could offer new insights into cell machinery and thus may advance many fields including drug discovery, molecular diagnostics, and clinical studies.","Current single-cell tools are limited by the number of proteins they can analyse. Here the authors report a single-cell cyclic multiplex in situ tagging (CycMIST) method for functional proteome profiling of single cells, allowing multiple rounds of multiplexing of the same single cells on a microchip.",2022-06-21
1893,Stability of high-temperature salty ice suggests electrolyte permeability in water-rich exoplanet icy mantles,"Electrolytes play an important role in the internal structure and dynamics of water-rich satellites and potentially water-rich exoplanets. However, in planets, the presence of a large high-pressure ice mantle is thought to hinder the exchange and transport of electrolytes between various liquid and solid deep layers. Here we show, using first-principles simulations, that up to 2.5 wt% NaCl can be dissolved in dense water ice at interior conditions of water-rich super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. The salt impurities enhance the diffusion of H atoms, extending the stability field of recently discovered superionic ice, and push towards higher pressures the transition to the stiffer ice X phase. Scaling laws for thermo-compositional convection show that salts entering the high pressure ice layer can be readily transported across. These findings suggest that the high-pressure ice mantle of water-rich exoplanets is permeable to the convective transport of electrolytes between the inner rocky core and the outer liquid layer.","Hot cubic ice is shown to retain dissolved salt in its lattice, suggesting the mantle of water-rich exoplanets is more permeable to electrolytes than assumed, which has implications on its properties and on the element cycles inside such planets.",2022-06-21
1894,Current-induced self-switching of perpendicular magnetization in CoPt single layer,"All-electric switching of perpendicular magnetization is a prerequisite for the integration of fast, high-density, and low-power magnetic memories and magnetic logic devices into electric circuits. To date, the field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of perpendicular magnetization has been observed in SOT bilayer and trilayer systems through various asymmetric designs, which mainly aim to break the mirror symmetry. Here, we report that the perpendicular magnetization of CoxPt100-x single layers within a special composition range (20 < x < 56) can be deterministically switched by electrical current in the absence of external magnetic field. Specifically, the Co30Pt70 shows the largest out-of-plane effective field efficiency and best switching performance. We demonstrate that this unique property arises from the cooperation of two structural mechanisms: the low crystal symmetry property at the Co platelet/Pt interfaces and the composition gradient along the thickness direction. Compared with that in bilayers or trilayers, the field-free switching in CoxPt100-x single layer greatly simplifies the SOT structure and avoids additional asymmetric designs.","One challenge for spin-based electronics is the controlled and reliable switching of magnetization without magnetic fields. Here, Liu et al investigate a variety of compositions of CoPt, and determine the specific composition to maximize switching performance, potentially simplifying device design.",2022-06-20
1895,Catalyst-free synthesis of sub-5 nm silicon nanowire arrays with massive lattice contraction and wide bandgap,"The need for miniaturized and high-performance devices has attracted enormous attention to the development of quantum silicon nanowires. However, the preparation of abundant quantities of silicon nanowires with the effective quantum-confined dimension remains challenging. Here, we prepare highly dense and vertically aligned sub-5 nm silicon nanowires with length/diameter aspect ratios greater than 10,000 by developing a catalyst-free chemical vapor etching process. We observe an unusual lattice reduction of up to 20% within ultra-narrow silicon nanowires and good oxidation stability in air compared to conventional silicon. Moreover, the material exhibits a direct optical bandgap of 4.16 eV and quasi-particle bandgap of 4.75 eV with the large exciton binding energy of 0.59 eV, indicating the significant phonon and electronic confinement. The results may provide an opportunity to investigate the chemistry and physics of highly confined silicon quantum nanostructures and may explore their potential uses in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and energy systems.","The preparation of quantum silicon nanowires, materials with potential application in high-performance nanodevices, is challenging. Here, the authors synthesize vertically aligned sub-5 nm silicon nanowires via a vapor phase silicon etching process; the resulting material features unusual lattice reduction and significant phonon and electronic confinement effects.",2022-06-20
1896,Bicyclic-ring base doping induces n-type conduction in carbon nanotubes with outstanding thermal stability in air,"The preparation of air and thermally stable n-type carbon nanotubes is desirable for their further implementation in electronic and energy devices that rely on both p- and n-type material. Here, a series of guanidine and amidine bases with bicyclic-ring structures are used as n-doping reagents. Aided by their rigid alkyl functionality and stable conjugate acid structure, these organic superbases can easily reduce carbon nanotubes. n-Type nanotubes doped with guanidine bases show excellent thermal stability in air, lasting for more than 6 months at 100 °C. As an example of energy device, a thermoelectric p/n junction module is constructed with a power output of ca. 4.7 μW from a temperature difference of 40 °C.","The preparation of stable n-type carbon nanotubes is desirable for their potential applications in molecular electronics. Here, the authors report that doping with bicyclic-ring organic superbases enables the synthesis of n-type carbon nanotubes with excellent thermal stability in air.",2022-06-20
1897,Structural basis of template strand deoxyuridine promoter recognition by a viral RNA polymerase,"Recognition of promoters in bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) is controlled by sigma subunits. The key sequence motif recognized by the sigma, the −10 promoter element, is located in the non-template strand of the double-stranded DNA molecule ~10 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site. Here, we explain the mechanism by which the phage AR9 non-virion RNAP (nvRNAP), a bacterial RNAP homolog, recognizes the −10 element of its deoxyuridine-containing promoter in the template strand. The AR9 sigma-like subunit, the nvRNAP enzyme core, and the template strand together form two nucleotide base-accepting pockets whose shapes dictate the requirement for the conserved deoxyuridines. A single amino acid substitution in the AR9 sigma-like subunit allows one of these pockets to accept a thymine thus expanding the promoter consensus. Our work demonstrates the extent to which viruses can evolve host-derived multisubunit enzymes to make transcription of their own genes independent of the host.","Promoter recognition is a critical step in the initiation of transcription of DNA to RNA. Here, the authors describe a novel mechanism by which a phage-encoded RNA polymerase recognizes viral promoters containing deoxyuridines instead of thymidines.",2022-06-20
1898,Satellite repeat transcripts modulate heterochromatin condensates and safeguard chromosome stability in mouse embryonic stem cells,"Heterochromatin maintains genome integrity and function, and is organised into distinct nuclear domains. Some of these domains are proposed to form by phase separation through the accumulation of HP1ɑ. Mouse heterochromatin contains noncoding major satellite repeats (MSR), which are highly transcribed in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, we report that MSR transcripts can drive the formation of HP1ɑ droplets in vitro, and modulate heterochromatin into dynamic condensates in ESCs, contributing to the formation of large nuclear domains that are characteristic of pluripotent cells. Depleting MSR transcripts causes heterochromatin to transition into a more compact and static state. Unexpectedly, changing heterochromatin’s biophysical properties has severe consequences for ESCs, including chromosome instability and mitotic defects. These findings uncover an essential role for MSR transcripts in modulating the organisation and properties of heterochromatin to preserve genome stability. They also provide insights into the processes that could regulate phase separation and the functional consequences of disrupting the properties of heterochromatin condensates.",Here the authors show satellite transcripts in mouse embryonic stem cells drive HP1α into droplets in vitro and also control HP1α organisation and association with chromatin in vivo. Depleting the satellite transcripts converts heterochromatin into a less dynamic and more static state and leads to chromosome instability.,2022-06-20
1899,Inhibition of negative feedback for persistent epithelial cell–cell junction contraction by p21-activated kinase 3,"Actin-mediated mechanical forces are central drivers of cellular dynamics. They generate protrusive and contractile dynamics, the latter of which are induced in concert with myosin II bundled at the site of contraction. These dynamics emerge concomitantly in tissues and even each cell; thus, the tight regulation of such bidirectional forces is important for proper cellular deformation. Here, we show that contractile dynamics can eventually disturb cell–cell junction contraction in the absence of p21-activated kinase 3 (Pak3). Upon Pak3 depletion, contractility induces the formation of abnormal actin protrusions at the shortening junctions, which causes decrease in E-cadherin levels at the adherens junctions and mislocalization of myosin II at the junctions before they enough shorten, compromising completion of junction shortening. Overexpressing E-cadherin restores myosin II distribution closely placed at the junctions and junction contraction. Our results suggest that contractility both induces and perturbs junction contraction and that the attenuation of such perturbations by Pak3 facilitates persistent junction shortening.","Actin and myosin operate at cell–cell junctions during junctional shortening. Here the authors show that prolonged actomyosin contractility can compromise junctional shortening, and that Pak3 is required for attenuation of abnormal active protrusive structure and thus keeps junction contraction, appropriate E-cadherin distribution, and junction shortening in Drosophila.",2022-06-20
1900,HarmonizR enables data harmonization across independent proteomic datasets with appropriate handling of missing values,"Dataset integration is common practice to overcome limitations in statistically underpowered omics datasets. Proteome datasets display high technical variability and frequent missing values. Sophisticated strategies for batch effect reduction are lacking or rely on error-prone data imputation. Here we introduce HarmonizR, a data harmonization tool with appropriate missing value handling. The method exploits the structure of available data and matrix dissection for minimal data loss, without data imputation. This strategy implements two common batch effect reduction methods—ComBat and limma (removeBatchEffect()). The HarmonizR strategy, evaluated on four exemplarily analyzed datasets with up to 23 batches, demonstrated successful data harmonization for different tissue preservation techniques, LC-MS/MS instrumentation setups, and quantification approaches. Compared to data imputation methods, HarmonizR was more efficient and performed superior regarding the detection of significant proteins. HarmonizR is an efficient tool for missing data tolerant experimental variance reduction and is easily adjustable for individual dataset properties and user preferences.","Dataset integration is common practice to overcome limitations in statistically underpowered omics datasets. Here the authors present “HarmonizR”, a tool for missing data tolerant experimental variance reduction in large, integrated but independently generated datasets without data imputation, adjustable for individual dataset modalities, correction algorithm, and user preferences.",2022-06-20
1901,SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant causes mild pathology in the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters,"Since its discovery in 2019, multiple variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been identified. This study investigates virus spread and associated pathology in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of Syrian golden hamsters at 4 days post intranasal SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection, in comparison to infection with variants of concern (VOCs) Gamma and Delta as well as ancestral strain 614 G. Pathological changes in the upper and lower respiratory tract of VOC Omicron infected hamsters are milder than those caused by other investigated strains. VOC Omicron infection causes a mild rhinitis with little involvement of the olfactory epithelium and minimal lesions in the lung, with frequent sparing of the alveolar compartment. Similarly, viral antigen, RNA and infectious virus titers are lower in respiratory tissues of VOC Omicron infected hamsters. These findings demonstrate that the variant has a decreased pathogenicity for the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters.","Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 several variants of concerns have been identified, with altered disease progression and transmission dynamics. Here, Armando et al. compare virus spread and pathology in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of Syrian golden hamster after 4 days post infection for VOCs Gamma, Delta and Omicron and find milder pathology for Omicron.",2022-06-20
1902,Near-zero-index ultra-fast pulse characterization,"Transparent conducting oxides exhibit giant optical nonlinearities in the near-infrared window where their linear index approaches zero. Despite the magnitude and speed of these nonlinearities, a “killer” optical application for these compounds has yet to be found. Because of the absorptive nature of the typically used intraband transitions, out-of-plane configurations with short optical paths should be considered. In this direction, we propose an alternative frequency-resolved optical gating scheme for the characterization of ultra-fast optical pulses that exploits near-zero-index aluminium zinc oxide thin films. Besides the technological advantages in terms of manufacturability and cost, our system outperforms commercial modules in key metrics, such as operational bandwidth, sensitivity, and robustness. The performance enhancement comes with the additional benefit of simultaneous self-phase-matched second and third harmonic generation. Because of the fundamental importance of novel methodologies to characterise ultra-fast events, our solution could be of fundamental use for numerous research labs and industries.","Frequency resolved optical gating is the core method for characterising ultra-fast optical pulses. Here, the authors use zero-index nonlinearities to largely enhance key performances and enable simultaneous second and third harmonic measurements.",2022-06-20
1903,Mapping the conformational energy landscape of Abl kinase using ClyA nanopore tweezers,"Protein kinases play central roles in cellular regulation by catalyzing the phosphorylation of target proteins. Kinases have inherent structural flexibility allowing them to switch between active and inactive states. Quantitative characterization of kinase conformational dynamics is challenging. Here, we use nanopore tweezers to assess the conformational dynamics of Abl kinase domain, which is shown to interconvert between two major conformational states where one conformation comprises three sub-states. Analysis of kinase-substrate and kinase-inhibitor interactions uncovers the functional roles of relevant states and enables the elucidation of the mechanism underlying the catalytic deficiency of an inactive Abl mutant G321V. Furthermore, we obtain the energy landscape of Abl kinase by quantifying the population and transition rates of the conformational states. These results extend the view on the dynamic nature of Abl kinase and suggest nanopore tweezers can be used as an efficient tool for other members of the human kinome.","Quantitative characterization of kinase conformational dynamics remains challenging. Here, the authors show that protein nanopore tweezers allow analyzing the conformational energy landscape and ligand binding of the Abl kinase domain.",2022-06-20
1904,Enantioselective Cu-catalyzed double hydroboration of alkynes to access chiral gem-diborylalkanes,"Chiral organoborons are of great value in asymmetric synthesis, functional materials, and medicinal chemistry. The development of chiral bis(boryl) alkanes, especially optically enriched 1,1-diboron compounds, has been greatly inhibited by the lack of direct synthetic protocols. Therefore, it is very challenging to develop a simple and effective strategy to obtain chiral 1,1-diborylalkanes. Herein, we develop an enantioselective copper-catalyzed cascade double hydroboration of terminal alkynes and highly enantioenriched gem-diborylalkanes were readily obtained. Our strategy uses simple terminal alkynes and two different boranes to construct valuable chiral gem-bis(boryl) alkanes with one catalytic and one ligand pattern, which represents the simplest and most straightforward strategy for constructing such chiral gem-diborons.","Optically enriched 1,1-diboron compounds are significantly underdeveloped because of the paucity of the straightforward synthetic protocols.

1905,Annual cycle observations of aerosols capable of ice formation in central Arctic clouds,"The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth, prompting glacial melt, permafrost thaw, and sea ice decline. These severe consequences induce feedbacks that contribute to amplified warming, affecting weather and climate globally. Aerosols and clouds play a critical role in regulating radiation reaching the Arctic surface. However, the magnitude of their effects is not adequately quantified, especially in the central Arctic where they impact the energy balance over the sea ice. Specifically, aerosols called ice nucleating particles (INPs) remain understudied yet are necessary for cloud ice production and subsequent changes in cloud lifetime, radiative effects, and precipitation. Here, we report observations of INPs in the central Arctic over a full year, spanning the entire sea ice growth and decline cycle. Further, these observations are size-resolved, affording valuable information on INP sources. Our results reveal a strong seasonality of INPs, with lower concentrations in the winter and spring controlled by transport from lower latitudes, to enhanced concentrations of INPs during the summer melt, likely from marine biological production in local open waters. This comprehensive characterization of INPs will ultimately help inform cloud parameterizations in models of all scales.",The Arctic is changing faster than anywhere else on Earth. Interactions between clouds and aerosols play a role in these changes. We report how the quantities and origins of aerosols that affect cloud ice formation change over a full sea ice cycle,2022-06-20
1906,Revealing the human mucinome,"Mucin domains are densely O-glycosylated modular protein domains found in various extracellular and transmembrane proteins. Mucin-domain glycoproteins play important roles in many human diseases, such as cancer and cystic fibrosis, but the scope of the mucinome remains poorly defined. Recently, we characterized a bacterial O-glycoprotease, StcE, and demonstrated that an inactive point mutant retains binding selectivity for mucin-domain glycoproteins. In this work, we leverage inactive StcE to selectively enrich and identify mucin-domain glycoproteins from complex samples like cell lysate and crude ovarian cancer patient ascites fluid. Our enrichment strategy is further aided by an algorithm to assign confidence to mucin-domain glycoprotein identifications. This mucinomics platform facilitates detection of hundreds of glycopeptides from mucin domains and highly overlapping populations of mucin-domain glycoproteins from ovarian cancer patients. Ultimately, we demonstrate our mucinomics approach can reveal key molecular signatures of cancer from in vitro and ex vivo sources.","Mucin-domain glycoproteins are densely O-glycosylated proteins with unique secondary structure that imparts a large influence on cellular environments. Here, the authors develop a technique to selectively enrich and characterize mucin-domain glycoproteins from cell lysate and patient biofluids.",2022-06-20
1907,Augmented ultrasonography with implanted CMOS electronic motes,"Modern clinical practice benefits significantly from imaging technologies and much effort is directed toward making this imaging more informative through the addition of contrast agents or reporters. Here, we report the design of a battery-less integrated circuit mote acting as an electronic reporter during medical ultrasound imaging. When implanted within the field-of-view of a brightness-mode (B-mode) ultrasound imager, this mote transmits information from its location through backscattered acoustic energy which is captured within the ultrasound image itself. We prototype and characterize the operation of such motes in vitro and in vivo. Performing with a static power consumption of less than 57 pW, the motes operate at duty cycles for receiving acoustic energy as low as 50 ppm. Motes within the same field-of-view during imaging have demonstrated signal-to-noise ratios of more than 19.1 dB at depths of up to 40 mm in lossy phantom. Physiological information acquired through such motes, which is beyond what is measurable with endogenous ultrasound backscatter and which is biogeographically located within an image, has the potential to provide an augmented ultrasonography.","Ultrasound has had tremendous success in medical imaging. Here, Zhang et al demonstrate a batteryless implantable CMOS mote, to further augment the potential of ultrasound, providing additional information via the backscattering of the acoustic waves used in ultrasound imaging.",2022-06-20
1908,Forest Fire Clustering for single-cell sequencing combines iterative label propagation with parallelized Monte Carlo simulations,"In the era of single-cell sequencing, there is a growing need to extract insights from data with clustering methods. Here, we introduce Forest Fire Clustering, an efficient and interpretable method for cell-type discovery from single-cell data. Forest Fire Clustering makes minimal prior assumptions and, different from current approaches, calculates a non-parametric posterior probability that each cell is assigned a cell-type label. These posterior distributions allow for the evaluation of a label confidence for each cell and enable the computation of “label entropies"", highlighting transitions along developmental trajectories. Furthermore, we show that Forest Fire Clustering can make robust, inductive inferences in an online-learning context and can readily scale to millions of cells. Finally, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art clustering approaches on diverse benchmarks of simulated and experimental data. Overall, Forest Fire Clustering is a useful tool for rare cell type discovery in large-scale single-cell analysis.","In the era of single-cell sequencing, there is a growing need to extract insights from data with clustering methods. Here, inspired by forest fire dynamics, the authors devise an algorithm that can cluster single-cell data with minimal prior assumptions and can compute a non-parametric posterior probability for each data point.",2022-06-20
1909,Broadband high-Q multimode silicon concentric racetrack resonators for widely tunable Raman lasers,"Multimode silicon resonators with ultralow propagation losses for ultrahigh quality (Q) factors have been attracting attention recently. However, conventional multimode silicon resonators only have high Q factors at certain wavelengths because the Q factors are reduced at wavelengths where fundamental modes and higher-order modes are both near resonances. Here, by implementing a broadband pulley directional coupler and concentric racetracks, we present a broadband high-Q multimode silicon resonator with average loaded Q factors of 1.4 × 106 over a wavelength range of 440 nm (1240–1680 nm). The mutual coupling between the two multimode racetracks can lead to two supermodes that mitigate the reduction in Q factors caused by the mode coupling of the higher-order modes. Based on the broadband high-Q multimode resonator, we experimentally demonstrated a broadly tunable Raman silicon laser with over 516 nm wavelength tuning range (1325–1841 nm), a threshold power of (0.4 ± 0.1) mW and a slope efficiency of (8.5 ± 1.5) % at 25 V reverse bias.",The authors demonstrate a new approach for multimode resonators to maintain high-quality-factor resonances across a broad wavelength range using the detuning between the symmetric and anti-symmetric supermodes in concentric racetrack resonators.,2022-06-20
1910,Optimal CD8+ T cell effector function requires costimulation-induced RNA-binding proteins that reprogram the transcript isoform landscape,"Boosting T cell activation through costimulation directs defense against cancer and viral infections. Despite multiple studies targeting costimulation in clinical trials, the increased potency and reprogramming of T cells endowed by costimulation is poorly understood. Canonical dogma states that transcription mediates T cell activation. Here, we show that the spliceosome, controlling post-transcriptional alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, is the most enriched pathway in T cells after CD134/CD137 costimulation. Costimulation of CD8+ T cells significantly increases expression of 29 RNA-binding proteins while RNA-seq uncovers over 1000 differential alternative splicing and polyadenylation events. Using in vivo mouse and in vitro human models, we demonstrate that RNA-binding protein Tardbp is required for effector cytokine production, CD8+ T cell clonal expansion, and isoform regulation after costimulation. The prospect of immune response optimization through reprogramming of mRNA isoform production offered herein opens new avenues for experimentally and therapeutically tuning the activities of T cells.",The provision of costimulatory signals to T cells are known to be vital in the direction and induction of a T cell driven response. Here the authors show an optimal T cell response requires a costimulatory induced modification of the transcript landscape and achieves this via modulation of the RNA binding proteins.,2022-06-20
1911,Low-noise frequency-agile photonic integrated lasers for coherent ranging,"Frequency modulated continuous wave laser ranging (FMCW LiDAR) enables distance mapping with simultaneous position and velocity information, is immune to stray light, can achieve long range, operate in the eye-safe region of 1550 nm and achieve high sensitivity. Despite its advantages, it is compounded by the simultaneous requirement of both narrow linewidth low noise lasers that can be precisely chirped. While integrated silicon-based lasers, compatible with wafer scale manufacturing in large volumes at low cost, have experienced major advances and are now employed on a commercial scale in data centers, and impressive progress has led to integrated lasers with (ultra) narrow sub-100 Hz-level intrinsic linewidth based on optical feedback from photonic circuits, these lasers presently lack fast nonthermal tuning, i.e. frequency agility as required for coherent ranging. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid photonic integrated laser that exhibits very narrow intrinsic linewidth of 25 Hz while offering linear, hysteresis-free, and mode-hop-free-tuning beyond 1 GHz with up to megahertz actuation bandwidth constituting 1.6 × 1015 Hz/s tuning speed. Our approach uses foundry-based technologies - ultralow-loss (1 dB/m) Si3N4 photonic microresonators, combined with aluminium nitride (AlN) or lead zirconium titanate (PZT) microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based stress-optic actuation. Electrically driven low-phase-noise lasing is attained by self-injection locking of an Indium Phosphide (InP) laser chip and only limited by fundamental thermo-refractive noise at mid-range offsets. By utilizing difference-drive and apodization of the photonic chip to suppress mechanical vibrations of the chip, a flat actuation response up to 10 MHz is achieved. We leverage this capability to demonstrate a compact coherent LiDAR engine that can generate up to 800 kHz FMCW triangular optical chirp signals, requiring neither any active linearization nor predistortion compensation, and perform a 10 m optical ranging experiment, with a resolution of 12.5 cm. Our results constitute a photonic integrated laser system for scenarios where high compactness, fast frequency actuation, and high spectral purity are required.",Stable and tunable integrated lasers are fundamental building blocks for applications from spectroscopy to imaging and communication. Here the authors present a narrow linewidth hybrid photonic integrated laser with low frequency noise and fast linear wavelength tuning. They then provide an efficient FMCW LIDAR demonstration.,2022-06-20
1912,Multimodal deep learning for Alzheimer’s disease dementia assessment,"Worldwide, there are nearly 10 million new cases of dementia annually, of which Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common. New measures are needed to improve the diagnosis of individuals with cognitive impairment due to various etiologies. Here, we report a deep learning framework that accomplishes multiple diagnostic steps in successive fashion to identify persons with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and non-AD dementias (nADD). We demonstrate a range of models capable of accepting flexible combinations of routinely collected clinical information, including demographics, medical history, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and functional assessments. We then show that these frameworks compare favorably with the diagnostic accuracy of practicing neurologists and neuroradiologists. Lastly, we apply interpretability methods in computer vision to show that disease-specific patterns detected by our models track distinct patterns of degenerative changes throughout the brain and correspond closely with the presence of neuropathological lesions on autopsy. Our work demonstrates methodologies for validating computational predictions with established standards of medical diagnosis.","Here the authors present a deep learning framework for dementia diagnosis, which can identify persons with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia due to other etiologies.",2022-06-20
1913,Global stable-isotope tracing metabolomics reveals system-wide metabolic alternations in aging Drosophila,"System-wide metabolic homeostasis is crucial for maintaining physiological functions of living organisms. Stable-isotope tracing metabolomics allows to unravel metabolic activity quantitatively by measuring the isotopically labeled metabolites, but has been largely restricted by coverage. Delineating system-wide metabolic homeostasis at the whole-organism level remains challenging. Here, we develop a global isotope tracing metabolomics technology to measure labeled metabolites with a metabolome-wide coverage. Using Drosophila as an aging model organism, we probe the in vivo tracing kinetics with quantitative information on labeling patterns, extents and rates on a metabolome-wide scale. We curate a system-wide metabolic network to characterize metabolic homeostasis and disclose a system-wide loss of metabolic coordinations that impacts both intra- and inter-tissue metabolic homeostasis significantly during Drosophila aging. Importantly, we reveal an unappreciated metabolic diversion from glycolysis to serine metabolism and purine metabolism as Drosophila aging. The developed technology facilitates a system-level understanding of metabolic regulation in living organisms.","Stable-isotope tracing allows quantifying metabolic activity by measuring isotopically labeled metabolites, but its metabolome coverage has been limited.

1914,EphB4 and ephrinB2 act in opposition in the head and neck tumor microenvironment,"Differential outcomes of EphB4-ephrinB2 signaling offers formidable challenge for the development of cancer therapeutics. Here, we interrogate the effects of targeting EphB4 and ephrinB2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and within its microenvironment using genetically engineered mice, recombinant constructs, pharmacologic agonists and antagonists. We observe that manipulating the EphB4 intracellular domain on cancer cells accelerates tumor growth and angiogenesis. EphB4 cancer cell loss also triggers compensatory upregulation of EphA4 and T regulatory cells (Tregs) influx and their targeting results in reversal of accelerated tumor growth mediated by EphB4 knockdown. EphrinB2 knockout on cancer cells and vasculature, on the other hand, results in maximal tumor reduction and vascular normalization. We report that EphB4 agonism provides no additional anti-tumoral benefit in the absence of ephrinB2. These results identify ephrinB2 as a tumor promoter and its receptor, EphB4, as a tumor suppressor in HNSCC, presenting opportunities for rational drug design.","EphrinB2 and its receptor EphB4 are highly expressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and disrupting EphB4-ephrinB2 interaction generates sub-optimal outcomes. Here, compartmental targeting of EphB4 and ephrinB2 in HNSCC cancer cell and endothelial compartments suggests that ephrinB2 acts as a tumor promoter and EphB4 as a tumor suppressor.",2022-06-20
1915,A practical fluorosulfonylating platform via photocatalytic imidazolium-based SO2F radical reagent,"Sulfonyl fluorides are key components in the fields of chemical biology, materials science and drug discovery. In this line, the highly active SO2F radical has been employed for the construction of sulfonyl fluorides, but the utilization of gaseous ClSO2F as radical precursor is limited due to the tedious and hazardous preparation. Meanwhile, the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides from inert SO2F2 gas through a fluorosulfonyl radical (·SO2F) process has met with inevitable difficulties due to the high homolytic bond dissociation energy of the S(VI)-F bond. Here we report a radical fluorosulfonylation strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of alkenyl sulfonyl fluorides and functional alkyl sulfonyl fluorides with an air-stable crystalline benzimidazolium fluorosulfonate cationic salt reagent. This bench-stable redox-active reagent offers a useful and operational protocol for the radical fluorosulfonylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons with good yield and high stereoselectivity, which can be further transformed into valuable functional SO2F moieties.","Sulfonyl fluorides have potential application in chemical biology, materials science, and drug discovery, but their preparation remains challenging.

1916,Peptide fusion improves prime editing efficiency,"Prime editing enables search-and-replace genome editing but is limited by low editing efficiency. We present a high-throughput approach, the Peptide Self-Editing sequencing assay (PepSEq), to measure how fusion of 12,000 85-amino acid peptides influences prime editing efficiency. We show that peptide fusion can enhance prime editing, prime-enhancing peptides combine productively, and a top dual peptide-prime editor increases prime editing significantly in multiple cell lines across dozens of target sites. Top prime-enhancing peptides function by increasing translation efficiency and serve as broadly useful tools to improve prime editing efficiency.","Prime editing enables search-and-replace genome editing but is limited by low editing efficiency.

1917,"Simulated co-optimization of renewable energy and desalination systems in Neom, Saudi Arabia","The interdependence between the water and power sectors is a growing concern as the need for desalination increases globally. Therefore, co-optimizing interdependent systems is necessary to understand the impact of one sector on another. We propose a framework to identify the optimal investment mix for a co-optimized water-power system and apply it to Neom, Saudi Arabia. Our results show that investment strategies that consider the co-optimization of both systems result in total cost savings for the power sector compared to independent approaches. Analysis results suggest that systems with higher shares of non-dispatchable renewables experience the most significant cost reductions.","Co-optimization of renewable power and water desalination systems for Neom, a futuristic seaside city in an arid region, results in more pronounced cost investment savings for a high share of renewable sources.",2022-06-18
1918,Complex regulation of Gephyrin splicing is a determinant of inhibitory postsynaptic diversity,"Gephyrin (GPHN) regulates the clustering of postsynaptic components at inhibitory synapses and is involved in pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we uncover an extensive diversity of GPHN transcripts that are tightly controlled by splicing during mouse and human brain development. Proteomic analysis reveals at least a hundred isoforms of GPHN incorporated at inhibitory Glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors containing synapses. They exhibit different localization and postsynaptic clustering properties, and altering the expression level of one isoform is sufficient to affect the number, size, and density of inhibitory synapses in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Furthermore, we discovered that splicing defects reported in neuropsychiatric disorders are carried by multiple alternative GPHN transcripts, demonstrating the need for a thorough analysis of the GPHN transcriptome in patients. Overall, we show that alternative splicing of GPHN is an important genetic variation to consider in neurological diseases and a determinant of the diversity of postsynaptic inhibitory synapses.","The protein gephyrin is involved in organizing synapses. Here, the authors show how different transcripts of gephyrin form and regulate inhibitory synapses.",2022-06-18
1919,Marine siliceous ecosystem decline led to sustained anomalous Early Triassic warmth,"In the wake of rapid CO2 release tied to the emplacement of the Siberian Traps, elevated temperatures were maintained for over five million years during the end-Permian biotic crisis. This protracted recovery defies our current understanding of climate regulation via the silicate weathering feedback, and hints at a fundamentally altered carbon and silica cycle. Here, we propose that the development of widespread marine anoxia and Si-rich conditions, linked to the collapse of the biological silica factory, warming, and increased weathering, was capable of trapping Earth’s system within a hyperthermal by enhancing ocean-atmosphere CO2 recycling via authigenic clay formation. While solid-Earth degassing may have acted as a trigger, subsequent biotic feedbacks likely exacerbated and prolonged the environmental crisis. This refined view of the carbon-silica cycle highlights that the ecological success of siliceous organisms exerts a potentially significant influence on Earth’s climate regime.",The widespread disappearance of siliceous life sustained extreme temperatures in the wake of Earth’s most severe mass extinction event.,2022-06-18
1920,A spin-crossover framework endowed with pore-adjustable behavior by slow structural dynamics,"Host-guest interactions play critical roles in achieving switchable structures and functionalities in porous materials, but design and control remain challenging. Here, we report a two-dimensional porous magnetic compound, [FeII(prentrz)2PdII(CN)4] (prentrz = (1E,2E)−3-phenyl-N-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)prop-2-en-1-imine), which exhibits an atypical pore transformation that directly entangles with a spin state transition in response to water adsorption. In this material, the adsorption-induced, non-uniform pedal motion of the axial prentrz ligands and the crumpling/unfolding of the layer structure actuate a reversible narrow quasi-discrete pore (nqp) to large channel-type pore (lcp) change that leads to a pore rearrangement associated with simultaneous pore opening and closing. The unusual pore transformation results in programmable adsorption in which the lcp structure type must be achieved first by the long-time exposure of the nqp structure type in a steam-saturated atmosphere to accomplish the gate-opening adsorption. The structural transformation is accompanied by a variation in the spin-crossover (SCO) property of FeII, i.e., two-step SCO with a large plateau for the lcp phase and two-step SCO with no plateau for the nqp phase. The unusual adsorption-induced pore rearrangement and the related SCO property offer a way to design and control the pore structure and physical properties of dynamic frameworks.","Host-guest interactions can play a critical role in achieving switchable porous materials, but controlling them remains challenging. Here the authors report an atypical pore rearrangement in a magnetic 2D porous framework upon water adsorption; the structural transformation affects the magnetic properties of the material.",2022-06-18
1921,Chromosome-level and haplotype-resolved genome provides insight into the tetraploid hybrid origin of patchouli,"Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth.), a member of the Lamiaceae family, is an important aromatic plant that has been widely used in medicine and perfumery. Here, we report a 1.94 Gb chromosome-scale assembly of the patchouli genome (contig N50 = 7.97 Mb). The gene annotation reveals that tandem duplication of sesquiterpene biosynthetic genes may be a major contributor to the biosynthesis of patchouli bioactivity components. We further phase the genome into two distinct subgenomes (A and B), and identify a chromosome substitution event that have occurred between them. Further investigations show that a burst of universal LTR-RTs in the A subgenome lead to the divergence between two subgenomes. However, no significant subgenome dominance is detected. Finally, we track the evolutionary scenario of patchouli including whole genome tetraploidization, subgenome divergency, hybridization, and chromosome substitution, which are the key forces to determine the complexity of patchouli genome. Our work sheds light on the evolutionary history of patchouli and offers unprecedented genomic resources for fundamental patchouli research and elite germplasm development.","The ploidy level of patchouli, an aromatic plant in the Lamiaceae family, remain unclear. Here, the authors assemble a chromosome-level and haplotype-resolved genome for patchouli and reveal that it is tetraploid hybrid as well as compensated aneuploidy.",2022-06-18
1922,Neuromorphic object localization using resistive memories and ultrasonic transducers,"Real-world sensory-processing applications require compact, low-latency, and low-power computing systems. Enabled by their in-memory event-driven computing abilities, hybrid memristive-Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor neuromorphic architectures provide an ideal hardware substrate for such tasks. To demonstrate the full potential of such systems, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an end-to-end sensory processing solution for a real-world object localization application. Drawing inspiration from the barn owl’s neuroanatomy, we developed a bio-inspired, event-driven object localization system that couples state-of-the-art piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer sensors to a neuromorphic resistive memories-based computational map. We present measurement results from the fabricated system comprising resistive memories-based coincidence detectors, delay line circuits, and a full-custom ultrasound sensor. We use these experimental results to calibrate our system-level simulations. These simulations are then used to estimate the angular resolution and energy efficiency of the object localization model. The results reveal the potential of our approach, evaluated in orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency than a microcontroller performing the same task.","The real-world object localization application needs a low-latency and power efficient computing system. Here, Moro et al. demonstrate a neuromorphic in-memory event driven system, inspired by the barn owl’s neuroanatomy, which is orders of magnitude more energy efficient than microcontrollers.",2022-06-18
1923,Bioorthogonally activatable cyanine dye with torsion-induced disaggregation for in vivo tumor imaging,"Advancement of bioorthogonal chemistry in molecular optical imaging lies in expanding the repertoire of fluorophores that can undergo fluorescence signal changes upon bioorthogonal ligation. However, most available bioorthogonally activatable fluorophores only emit shallow tissue-penetrating visible light via an intramolecular charge transfer mechanism. Herein, we report a serendipitous “torsion-induced disaggregation (TIDA)” phenomenon in the design of near-infrared (NIR) tetrazine (Tz)-based cyanine probe. The TIDA of the cyanine is triggered upon Tz-transcyclooctene ligation, converting its heptamethine chain from S-trans to S-cis conformation. Thus, after bioorthogonal reaction, the tendency of the resulting cyanine towards aggregation is reduced, leading to TIDA-induced fluorescence enhancement response. This Tz-cyanine probe sensitively delineates the tumor in living mice as early as 5 min post intravenous injection. As such, this work discovers a design mechanism for the construction of bioorthogonally activatable NIR fluorophores and opens up opportunities to further exploit bioorthogonal chemistry in in vivo imaging.","Expanding the responsive dyes repertoire is currently a developing field in biorthogonal chemistry. In this article, the authors develop fluorophores that turn on their near-infrared fluorescence upon biorthogonal reaction based on a “torsion-induced disaggregation” approach, allowing for sensitive in vivo imaging of tumors.",2022-06-18
1924,A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial for pharmacological activation of BCAA catabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes,"Elevations in plasma branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels associate with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Pre-clinical models suggest that lowering BCAA levels improve glucose tolerance, but data in humans are lacking. Here, we used sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB), an accelerator of BCAA catabolism, as tool to lower plasma BCAA levels in patients with T2D, and evaluate its effect on metabolic health. This trial (NetherlandsTrialRegister: NTR7426) had a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over design and was performed in the Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC+), the Netherlands, between February 2019 and February 2020. Patients were eligible for the trial if they were 40–75years, BMI of 25–38 kg/m², relatively well-controlled T2D (HbA1C < 8.5%) and treated with oral glucose-lowering medication. Eighteen participants were randomly assigned to receive either NaPB 4.8 g/m²/day and placebo for 2 weeks via controlled randomization and sixteen participants completed the study. The primary outcome was peripheral insulin sensitivity. Secondary outcomes were ex vivo muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity, substrate oxidation and ectopic fat accumulation. Fasting blood samples were collected to determine levels of BCAA, their catabolic intermediates, insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFA) and glucose. NaPB led to a robust 27% improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity compared to placebo (ΔRd:13.2 ± 1.8 vs. 9.6 ± 1.8 µmol/kg/min, p = 0.02). This was paralleled by an improvement in pyruvate-driven muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and whole-body insulin-stimulated carbohydrate oxidation, and a reduction in plasma BCAA and glucose levels. No effects were observed on levels of insulin, triglycerides and FFA, neither did fat accumulation in muscle and liver change. No adverse events were reported. These data establish the proof-of-concept in humans that modulating the BCAA oxidative pathway may represent a potential treatment strategy for patients with T2D.","Evidence from preclinical models suggest that lowering levels of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) improves glucose metabolism.

1925,Three-dimensional photonic topological insulator without spin–orbit coupling,"Spin–orbit coupling, a fundamental mechanism underlying topological insulators, has been introduced to construct the latter’s photonic analogs, or photonic topological insulators (PTIs). However, the intrinsic lack of electronic spin in photonic systems leads to various imperfections in emulating the behaviors of topological insulators. For example, in the recently demonstrated three-dimensional (3D) PTI, the topological surface states emerge, not on the surface of a single crystal as in a 3D topological insulator, but along an internal domain wall between two PTIs. Here, by fully abolishing spin–orbit coupling, we design and demonstrate a 3D PTI whose topological surface states are self-guided on its surface, without extra confinement by another PTI or any other cladding. The topological phase follows the original Fu’s model for the topological crystalline insulator without spin–orbit coupling. Unlike conventional linear Dirac cones, a unique quadratic dispersion of topological surface states is directly observed with microwave measurement. Our work opens routes to the topological manipulation of photons at the outer surface of photonic bandgap materials.","Photonic topological insulators offer unconventional, yet still difficult, ways to control light flow. Here the authors demonstrate a 3D photonic topological insulator with surface states confined and guided on the surfaces without adding any cladding.",2022-06-17
1926,Electrochemically driven regioselective C−H phosphorylation of group 8 metallocenes,"Metallocenes are privileged backbones for synthesis and catalysis. However, the direct dehydrogenative C−H functionalization of unsymmetric metallocenes suffers from reactivity and selectivity issues. Herein, we report an electrochemically driven regioselective C−H phosphorylation of group 8 metallocenes. Mechanistic investigations indicate this dehydrogenative cross coupling occurs through an electrophilic radical substitution of the metallocene with a phosphoryl radical, facilitated by the metallocene itself. This work not only offers an efficient and divergent synthesis of phosphorylated metallocenes, but also provides a guide to interpret the reactivity and regioselectivity for the C−H functionalization of unsymmetric metallocenes.","Metallocene-based phosphines are compounds with potential use in catalysis. Here, the authors report the electrochemical regioselective functionalization of group 8 metallocenes with phosphine oxides; over 60 examples of phosphorylated (benzo)ferrocenes and ruthenocenes can be accessed via this method without the need for a preinstalled directing group.",2022-06-17
1927,ZFP281-BRCA2 prevents R-loop accumulation during DNA replication,"R-loops are prevalent in mammalian genomes and involved in many fundamental cellular processes. Depletion of BRCA2 leads to aberrant R-loop accumulation, contributing to genome instability. Here, we show that ZFP281 cooperates with BRCA2 in preventing R-loop accumulation to facilitate DNA replication in embryonic stem cells. ZFP281 depletion reduces PCNA levels on chromatin and impairs DNA replication. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that ZFP281 can interact with BRCA2, and that BRCA2 is enriched at G/C-rich promoters and requires both ZFP281 and PRC2 for its proper recruitment to the bivalent chromatin at the genome-wide scale. Furthermore, depletion of ZFP281 or BRCA2 leads to accumulation of R-loops over the bivalent regions, and compromises activation of the developmental genes by retinoic acid during stem cell differentiation. In summary, our results reveal that ZFP281 recruits BRCA2 to the bivalent chromatin regions to ensure proper progression of DNA replication through preventing persistent R-loops.","R-loops are prevalent in mammalian genomes and involved in many fundamental cellular processes. Here, Wang et al. report that ZFP281 cooperates with BRCA2 in preventing R-loop accumulation to facilitate DNA replication in embryonic stem cells.",2022-06-17
1928,Comparative parallel multi-omics analysis during the induction of pluripotent and trophectoderm states,"Following fertilization, it is only at the 32-64-cell stage when a clear segregation between cells of the inner cell mass and trophectoderm is observed, suggesting a ‘T’-shaped model of specification. Here, we examine whether the acquisition of these two states in vitro, by nuclear reprogramming, share similar dynamics/trajectories. Using a comparative parallel multi-omics analysis (i.e., bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, RRBS and CNVs) on cells undergoing reprogramming to pluripotency and TSC state we show that each reprogramming system exhibits specific trajectories from the onset of the process, suggesting ‘V’-shaped model. We describe in detail the various trajectories toward the two states and illuminate reprogramming stage-specific markers, blockers, facilitators and TSC subpopulations. Finally, we show that while the acquisition of the TSC state involves the silencing of embryonic programs by DNA methylation, during the acquisition of pluripotency these regions are initially defined but retain inactive by the elimination of H3K27ac.","Ectopic transcription factor expression can reprogram mouse fibroblasts to pluripotent or trophoblast stem cells.

1929,Asynchronous glutamate release is enhanced in low release efficacy synapses and dispersed across the active zone,"The balance between fast synchronous and delayed asynchronous release of neurotransmitters has a major role in defining computational properties of neuronal synapses and regulation of neuronal network activity. However, how it is tuned at the single synapse level remains poorly understood. Here, using the fluorescent glutamate sensor SF-iGluSnFR, we image quantal vesicular release in tens to hundreds of individual synaptic outputs from single pyramidal cells with 4 millisecond temporal and 75 nm spatial resolution. We find that the ratio between synchronous and asynchronous synaptic vesicle exocytosis varies extensively among synapses supplied by the same axon, and that the synchronicity of release is reduced at low release probability synapses. We further demonstrate that asynchronous exocytosis sites are more widely distributed within the release area than synchronous sites. Together, our results reveal a universal relationship between the two major functional properties of synapses – the timing and the overall efficacy of neurotransmitter release.",Neurotransmitters can be released with a delay in relation to action potentials. This work demonstrates how this asynchronous release is related to overall vesicle release probability and short-term plasticity.,2022-06-17
1930,Cryo-EM structure of an amyloid fibril formed by full-length human SOD1 reveals its conformational conversion,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease. Misfolded Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) has been linked to both familial and sporadic ALS. SOD1 fibrils formed in vitro share toxic properties with ALS inclusions. Here we produced cytotoxic amyloid fibrils from full-length apo human SOD1 under reducing conditions and determined the atomic structure using cryo-EM. The SOD1 fibril consists of a single protofilament with a left-handed helix. The fibril core exhibits a serpentine fold comprising N-terminal segment (residues 3–55) and C-terminal segment (residues 86–153) with an intrinsic disordered segment. The two segments are zipped up by three salt bridge pairs. By comparison with the structure of apo SOD1 dimer, we propose that eight β-strands (to form a β-barrel) and one α-helix in the subunit of apo SOD1 convert into thirteen β-strands stabilized by five hydrophobic cavities in the SOD1 fibril. Our data provide insights into how SOD1 converts between structurally and functionally distinct states.","Misfolded SOD1 has been linked to both familial and sporadic ALS. Here the authors have determined the cryo-EM structure of SOD1 fibrils, providing insights into the conversion of SOD1 from its immature form into an aggregated form during pathogenesis of ALS.",2022-06-17
1931,Functional but not obligatory link between microsaccades and neural modulation by covert spatial attention,"Covert spatial attention is associated with spatial modulation of neural activity as well as with directional biases in fixational eye movements known as microsaccades. We studied how these two ‘fingerprints’ of attention are interrelated in humans. We investigated spatial modulation of 8-12 Hz EEG alpha activity and microsaccades when attention is directed internally within the spatial layout of visual working memory. Consistent with a common origin, spatial modulations of alpha activity and microsaccades co-vary: alpha lateralisation is stronger in trials with microsaccades toward versus away from the memorised location of the to-be-attended item and occurs earlier in trials with earlier microsaccades toward this item. Critically, however, trials without attention-driven microsaccades nevertheless show clear spatial modulation of alpha activity – comparable to trials with attention-driven microsaccades. Thus, directional biases in microsaccades correlate with neural signatures of spatial attention, but they are not necessary for neural modulation by spatial attention to be manifest.","Covert visual spatial attention modulates neural activity and biases the direction of small eye movements, known as microsaccades. Here, the authors show that these two markers co-vary, but that microsaccades are not necessary for neural modulation by attention to occur.",2022-06-17
1932,Addressing challenges with real-world synthetic control arms to demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of Pralsetinib in non-small cell lung cancer,"As advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) is being increasingly divided into rare oncogene-driven subsets, conducting randomised trials becomes challenging. Using real-world data (RWD) to construct control arms for single-arm trials provides an option for comparative data. However, non-randomised treatment comparisons have the potential to be biased and cause concern for decision-makers. Using the example of pralsetinib from a RET fusion-positive aNSCLC single-arm trial (NCT03037385), we demonstrate a relative survival benefit when compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab with chemotherapy RWD cohorts. Quantitative bias analyses show that results for the RWD-trial comparisons are robust to data missingness, potential poorer outcomes in RWD and residual confounding. Overall, the study provides evidence in favour of pralsetinib as a first-line treatment for RET fusion-positive aNSCLC. The quantification of potential bias performed in this study can be used as a template for future studies of this nature.","Real-world data (RWD) based control arms provide an option to compare the effectiveness of single-arm trials. By performing multiple quantitative bias analyses to alleviate concerns about trial-RWD comparability, here the authors show that the RET inhibitor pralsetinib provides survival benefit in patients with RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer from the ARROW single-arm trial, (NCT03037385) when compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab with chemotherapy RWD cohorts.",2022-06-17
1933,Highly luminescent scintillating hetero-ligand MOF nanocrystals with engineered Stokes shift for photonic applications,"Large Stokes shift fast emitters show a negligible reabsorption of their luminescence, a feature highly desirable for several applications such as fluorescence imaging, solar-light managing, and fabricating sensitive scintillating detectors for medical imaging and high-rate high-energy physics experiments. Here we obtain high efficiency luminescence with significant Stokes shift by exploiting fluorescent conjugated acene building blocks arranged in nanocrystals. Two ligands of equal molecular length and connectivity, yet complementary electronic properties, are co-assembled by zirconium oxy-hydroxy clusters, generating crystalline hetero-ligand metal-organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals. The diffusion of singlet excitons within the MOF and the matching of ligands absorption and emission properties enables an ultrafast activation of the low energy emission in the 100 ps time scale. The hybrid nanocrystals show a fluorescence quantum efficiency of ~60% and a Stokes shift as large as 750 meV (~6000 cm−1), which suppresses the emission reabsorption also in bulk devices. The fabricated prototypal nanocomposite fast scintillator shows benchmark performances which compete with those of some inorganic and organic commercial systems.","The development of highly luminescent materials such as large Stokes shift fast emitters is desirable for their potential application in photonics.

1934,RIViT-seq enables systematic identification of regulons of transcriptional machineries,"Transcriptional regulation is a critical process to ensure expression of genes necessary for growth and survival in diverse environments. Transcription is mediated by multiple transcription factors including activators, repressors and sigma factors. Accurate computational prediction of the regulon of target genes for transcription factors is difficult and experimental identification is laborious and not scalable. Here, we demonstrate regulon identification by in vitro transcription-sequencing (RIViT-seq) that enables systematic identification of regulons of transcription factors by combining an in vitro transcription assay and RNA-sequencing. Using this technology, target genes of 11 sigma factors were identified in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). The RIViT-seq data expands the transcriptional regulatory network in this bacterium, discovering regulatory cascades and crosstalk between sigma factors. Implementation of RIViT-seq with other transcription factors and in other organisms will improve our understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks across biology.","Here the authors present their method ‘regulon identification by in vitro transcription-sequencing’ (RIViT-seq), which enables systematic identification of target genes of transcription factors of interest.

1935,A global lipid map reveals host dependency factors conserved across SARS-CoV-2 variants,"A comprehensive understanding of host dependency factors for SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive. Here, we map alterations in host lipids following SARS-CoV-2 infection using nontargeted lipidomics. We find that SARS-CoV-2 rewires host lipid metabolism, significantly altering hundreds of lipid species to effectively establish infection. We correlate these changes with viral protein activity by transfecting human cells with each viral protein and performing lipidomics. We find that lipid droplet plasticity is a key feature of infection and that viral propagation can be blocked by small-molecule glycerolipid biosynthesis inhibitors. We find that this inhibition was effective against the main variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), indicating that glycerolipid biosynthesis is a conserved host dependency factor that supports this evolving virus.","Here, Farley et al. perform untargeted lipidomics to assess how SARS-CoV-2 rewires host lipid metabolism.

1936,Secondary through-space interactions facilitated single-molecule white-light emission from clusteroluminogens,"Clusteroluminogens refer to some non-conjugated molecules that show visible light and unique electronic properties with through-space interactions due to the formation of aggregates. Although mature and systematic theories of molecular photophysics have been developed to study conventional conjugated chromophores, it is still challenging to endow clusteroluminogens with designed photophysical properties by manipulating through-space interactions. Herein, three clusteroluminogens with non-conjugated donor-acceptor structures and different halide substituents are designed and synthesized. These compounds show multiple emissions and even single-molecule white-light emission in the crystalline state. The intensity ratio of these emissions is easily manipulated by changing the halide atom and excitation wavelength. Experimental and theoretical results successfully disclose the electronic nature of these multiple emissions: through-space conjugation for short-wavelength fluorescence, through-space charge transfer based on secondary through-space interactions for long-wavelength fluorescence, and room-temperature phosphorescence. The introduction of secondary through-space interactions to clusteroluminogens not only enriches their varieties of photophysical properties but also inspires the establishment of novel aggregate photophysics for clusteroluminescence.","Although mature and systematic theories of molecular photophysics have been developed, it is still challenging to endow clusteroluminogens (CLgens) with designed photophysical properties by manipulating through-space interactions.

1937,The architecture and operating mechanism of a cnidarian stinging organelle,"The stinging organelles of jellyfish, sea anemones, and other cnidarians, known as nematocysts, are remarkable cellular weapons used for both predation and defense. Nematocysts consist of a pressurized capsule containing a coiled harpoon-like thread. These structures are in turn built within specialized cells known as nematocytes. When triggered, the capsule explosively discharges, ejecting the coiled thread which punctures the target and rapidly elongates by turning inside out in a process called eversion. Due to the structural complexity of the thread and the extreme speed of discharge, the precise mechanics of nematocyst firing have remained elusive7. Here, using a combination of live and super-resolution imaging, 3D electron microscopy, and genetic perturbations, we define the step-by-step sequence of nematocyst operation in the model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. This analysis reveals the complex biomechanical transformations underpinning the operating mechanism of nematocysts, one of nature’s most exquisite biological micro-machines. Further, this study will provide insight into the form and function of related cnidarian organelles and serve as a template for the design of bioinspired microdevices.","The venomous stinging cells of jellyfish, anemones, and corals contain an organelle, the nematocyst, which explosively discharges a venom-laden thread.

1938,Bifurcation drives the evolution of assembly-line biosynthesis,"Reprogramming biosynthetic assembly-lines is a topic of intense interest. This is unsurprising as the scaffolds of most antibiotics in current clinical use are produced by such pathways. The modular nature of assembly-lines provides a direct relationship between the sequence of enzymatic domains and the chemical structure of the product, but rational reprogramming efforts have been met with limited success. To gain greater insight into the design process, we wanted to examine how Nature creates assembly-lines and searched for biosynthetic pathways that might represent evolutionary transitions. By examining the biosynthesis of the anti-tubercular wollamides, we uncover how whole gene duplication and neofunctionalization can result in pathway bifurcation. We show that, in the case of the wollamide biosynthesis, neofunctionalization is initiated by intragenomic recombination. This pathway bifurcation leads to redundancy, providing the genetic robustness required to enable large structural changes during the evolution of antibiotic structures. Should the new product be non-functional, gene loss can restore the original genotype. However, if the new product confers an advantage, depreciation and eventual loss of the original gene creates a new linear pathway. This provides the blind watchmaker equivalent to the design, build, test cycle of synthetic biology.","Reprogramming biosynthetic assembly-lines is a topic of interest for antibiotics. Here, the authors explore the evolutionary biosynthesis of anti-tubercular wollamides, show gene duplication and neo-functionalisation results in bifurcation allowing for testing of new structures with the ability to recover old structures by gene loss.",2022-06-17

Recently, small scale optomechanical circuits, connecting a few optical and mechanical modes, have been demonstrated in an ongoing push towards multi-mode on-chip optomechanical systems. An ambitious goal driving this trend is to produce topologically protected phonon transport. Once realized, this will unlock the full toolbox of optomechanics for investigations of topological phononics. Here, we report the realization of topological phonon transport in an optomechanical device. Our experiment is based on an innovative multiscale optomechanical crystal design and allows for site-resolved measurements in an array of more than 800 cavities. The sensitivity inherent in our optomechanical read-out allowed us to detect thermal fluctuations traveling along topological edge channels. This represents a major step forward in an ongoing effort to downscale mechanical topological systems.","To realize the full promise of topological mechanical vibrations, they have to be controlled successfully at the nanoscale.

1940,Core and rod structures of a thermophilic cyanobacterial light-harvesting phycobilisome,"Cyanobacteria, glaucophytes, and rhodophytes utilize giant, light-harvesting phycobilisomes (PBSs) for capturing solar energy and conveying it to photosynthetic reaction centers. PBSs are compositionally and structurally diverse, and exceedingly complex, all of which pose a challenge for a comprehensive understanding of their function. To date, three detailed architectures of PBSs by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have been described: a hemiellipsoidal type, a block-type from rhodophytes, and a cyanobacterial hemidiscoidal-type. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of a pentacylindrical allophycocyanin core and phycocyanin-containing rod of a thermophilic cyanobacterial hemidiscoidal PBS. The structures define the spatial arrangement of protein subunits and chromophores, crucial for deciphering the energy transfer mechanism. They reveal how the pentacylindrical core is formed, identify key interactions between linker proteins and the bilin chromophores, and indicate pathways for unidirectional energy transfer.","Phycobilisome (PBS) absorbs solar energy and transfer the energy to photosynthetic membrane proteins.

1941,Deficiency in endocannabinoid synthase DAGLB contributes to early onset Parkinsonism and murine nigral dopaminergic neuron dysfunction,"Endocannabinoid (eCB), 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), the most abundant eCB in the brain, regulates diverse neural functions. Here we linked multiple homozygous loss-of-function mutations in 2-AG synthase diacylglycerol lipase β (DAGLB) to an early onset autosomal recessive Parkinsonism. DAGLB is the main 2-AG synthase in human and mouse substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic neurons (DANs). In mice, the SN 2-AG levels were markedly correlated with motor performance during locomotor skill acquisition. Genetic knockdown of Daglb in nigral DANs substantially reduced SN 2-AG levels and impaired locomotor skill learning, particularly the across-session learning. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of 2-AG degradation increased nigral 2-AG levels, DAN activity and dopamine release and rescued the locomotor skill learning deficits. Together, we demonstrate that DAGLB-deficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinsonism, reveal the importance of DAGLB-mediated 2-AG biosynthesis in nigral DANs in regulating neuronal activity and dopamine release, and suggest potential benefits of 2-AG augmentation in alleviating Parkinsonism.","2- arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), an abundant endocannabinoid in the brain, regulates diverse neural functions. Here, the authors identified four loss-of-function mutations in dicylglycerol lipase β (DAGLB) from six patients with early onset Parkinsonism. In mice, loss of DAGLB in dopamine neurons reduced neuronal activity and impaired locomotor function and augmentation of 2-AG levels boosted neuronal activity and rescued locomotor deficits.",2022-06-17
1942,FUNDC2 promotes liver tumorigenesis by inhibiting MFN1-mediated mitochondrial fusion,"Mitochondria generate ATP and play regulatory roles in various cellular activities. Cancer cells often exhibit fragmented mitochondria. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we report that a mitochondrial protein FUN14 domain containing 2 (FUNDC2) is transcriptionally upregulated in primary mouse liver tumors, and in approximately 40% of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, elevated FUNDC2 expression inversely correlates with patient survival, and its knockdown inhibits liver tumorigenesis in mice. Mechanistically, the amino-terminal region of FUNDC2 interacts with the GTPase domain of mitofusin 1 (MFN1), thus inhibits its activity in promoting fusion of outer mitochondrial membrane. As a result, loss of FUNDC2 leads to mitochondrial elongation, decreased mitochondrial respiration, and reprogrammed cellular metabolism. These results identified a mechanism of mitochondrial fragmentation in cancer through MFN1 inhibition by FUNDC2, and suggested FUNDC2 as a potential therapeutic target of HCC.","Fragmented mitochondria are a frequent hallmark of cancer, but the cause and consequence are less clear. The authors demonstrate that elevated FUNDC2 causes mitochondrial fragmentation through inhibition of MFN1 in hepatocellular carcinoma and that knockdown of FUNDC2 inhibits liver tumorigenesis in mice.",2022-06-17
1943,Freezing solute atoms in nanograined aluminum alloys via high-density vacancies,"Low-temperature decomposition of supersaturated solid solution into unfavorable intergranular precipitates is a long-standing bottleneck limiting the practical applications of nanograined aluminum alloys that are prepared by severe plastic deformation. Minimizing the vacancy concentration is generally regarded as an effective approach in suppressing the decomposition process. Here we report a counterintuitive strategy to stabilize supersaturated solid solution in nanograined Al-Cu alloys via high-density vacancies in combination with Sc microalloying. By generating a two orders of magnitude higher concentration of vacancies bonded in strong (Cu, Sc, vacancy)-rich atomic complexes, a high thermal stability is achieved in an Al-Cu-Sc alloy that precipitation is nearly suppressed up to ~230 °C. The solute-vacancy complexes also enable the nanograined Al-Cu alloys with higher strength, greater strain hardening capability and ductility. These findings provide perspectives towards the great potentials of solute-vacancy interaction and the development of nanograined alloys with high stability and well-performed mechanical properties.",Low-temperature decomposition and insufficient plastic deformability are bottlenecks that limit the practical applications of nanograined Al alloys. Here the authors utilize a high density vacancies in combination with Sc microalloying to stabilize nanograined Al-Cu alloys.,2022-06-17
1944,Context-dependent enhancer function revealed by targeted inter-TAD relocation,"The expression of some genes depends on large, adjacent regions of the genome that contain multiple enhancers. These regulatory landscapes frequently align with Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), where they integrate the function of multiple similar enhancers to produce a global, TAD-specific regulation. We asked if an individual enhancer could overcome the influence of one of these landscapes, to drive gene transcription. To test this, we transferred an enhancer from its native location, into a nearby TAD with a related yet different functional specificity. We used the biphasic regulation of Hoxd genes during limb development as a paradigm. These genes are first activated in proximal limb cells by enhancers located in one TAD, which is then silenced when the neighboring TAD activates its enhancers in distal limb cells. We transferred a distal limb enhancer into the proximal limb TAD and found that its new context suppresses its normal distal specificity, even though it is bound by HOX13 transcription factors, which are responsible for the distal activity. This activity can be rescued only when a large portion of the surrounding environment is removed. These results indicate that, at least in some cases, the functioning of enhancer elements is subordinated to the host chromatin context, which can exert a dominant control over its activity.",Here the authors show that a strong enhancer sequence can be controlled by the chromatin environment provided by a topologically associated domain (TAD) located nearby. An enhancer relocated by homologous recombination takes all the hallmarks of its new neighboring enhancers located in the recipient TAD.,2022-06-17
1945,"The chromatin remodeller ATRX facilitates diverse nuclear processes, in a stochastic manner, in both heterochromatin and euchromatin","The chromatin remodeller ATRX interacts with the histone chaperone DAXX to deposit the histone variant H3.3 at sites of nucleosome turnover. ATRX is known to bind repetitive, heterochromatic regions of the genome including telomeres, ribosomal DNA and pericentric repeats, many of which are putative G-quadruplex forming sequences (PQS). At these sites ATRX plays an ancillary role in a wide range of nuclear processes facilitating replication, chromatin modification and transcription. Here, using an improved protocol for chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that ATRX also binds active regulatory elements in euchromatin. Mutations in ATRX lead to perturbation of gene expression associated with a reduction in chromatin accessibility, histone modification, transcription factor binding and deposition of H3.3 at the sequences to which it normally binds. In erythroid cells where downregulation of α-globin expression is a hallmark of ATR-X syndrome, perturbation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression occurs in only a subset of cells. The stochastic nature of this process suggests that ATRX acts as a general facilitator of cell specific transcriptional and epigenetic programmes, both in heterochromatin and euchromatin.","The chromatin remodeling complex ATRX can promote gene expression, for example by binding G-quadruplexes (G4s) to prevent their negative effect on expression. Here the authors use a single-cell approach to show that only a subset of erythroid cells isolated from patients with ATRX mutations have reduced chromatin accessibility and alpha globin expression, suggesting a stochastic process.",2022-06-17
1946,3D structure and in situ arrangements of CatSper channel in the sperm flagellum,"The sperm calcium channel CatSper plays a central role in successful fertilization as a primary Ca2+ gateway. Here, we applied cryo-electron tomography to visualize the higher-order organization of the native CatSper complex in intact mammalian sperm. The repeating CatSper units form long zigzag-rows along mouse and human sperm flagella. Above each tetrameric channel pore, most of the extracellular domains form a canopy that interconnects to a zigzag-shaped roof. Murine CatSper contains an additional wing-structure connected to the tetrameric channel. The intracellular domains link two neighboring channels to a diagonal array, suggesting a dimer formation. Fitting of an atomic model of isolated monomeric CatSper to the in situ map reveals supramolecular interactions and assembly of the CatSper complex. Loss of EFCAB9-CATSPERζ alters the architecture and interactions of the channels, resulting in fragmentation and misalignment of the zigzag-rows and disruption of flagellar movement in Efcab9−/− sperm. This work offers unique insights into the structural basis for understanding CatSper regulation of sperm motility.","Sperm motility and male fertility requires function of the CatSper calcium channels. Here, using cryo-electron tomography, authors visualize the native in-cell 3D structure and higher-order organization of the CatSper as long zigzag rows along the sperm tail.",2022-06-17
1947,Adipocyte-derived kynurenine promotes obesity and insulin resistance by activating the AhR/STAT3/IL-6 signaling,"Aberrant amino acid metabolism is a common event in obesity. Particularly, subjects with obesity are characterized by the excessive plasma kynurenine (Kyn). However, the primary source of Kyn and its impact on metabolic syndrome are yet to be fully addressed. Herein, we show that the overexpressed indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in adipocytes predominantly contributes to the excessive Kyn, indicating a central role of adipocytes in Kyn metabolism. Depletion of Ido1 in adipocytes abrogates Kyn accumulation, protecting mice against obesity. Mechanistically, Kyn impairs lipid homeostasis in adipocytes via activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 /interleukin-6 signaling. Genetic ablation of AhR in adipocytes abolishes the effect of Kyn. Moreover, supplementation of vitamin B6 ameliorated Kyn accumulation, protecting mice from obesity. Collectively, our data support that adipocytes are the primary source of increased circulating Kyn, while elimination of accumulated Kyn could be a viable strategy against obesity.","Kynurenine, a tryptophan metabolite, is increased in the circulating plasma of obese individuals, but the source has been unclear. Here, the authors show in mice that mature adipocytes produce kynurenine, with vitamin B6 administration preventing accumulation and protecting against high-fat diet.",2022-06-17
1948,ARID1A loss derepresses a group of human endogenous retrovirus-H loci to modulate BRD4-dependent transcription,"Transposable elements (TEs) through evolutionary exaptation have become an integral part of the human genome, offering ample regulatory sequences and shaping chromatin 3D architecture. While the functional impacts of TE-derived sequences on early embryogenesis have been recognized, their roles in malignancy are only starting to emerge. Here we show that many TEs, especially the pluripotency-related human endogenous retrovirus H (HERVH), are abnormally activated in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples. Transcriptional upregulation of HERVH is associated with mutations of several tumor suppressors, particularly ARID1A. Knockout of ARID1A in CRC cells leads to increased transcription at several HERVH loci, which involves compensatory contribution by ARID1B. Suppression of HERVH in CRC cells and patient-derived organoids impairs tumor growth. Mechanistically, HERVH transcripts colocalize with nuclear BRD4 foci, modulating their dynamics and co-regulating many target genes. Altogether, we uncover a critical role for ARID1A in restraining HERVH, whose abnormal activation can promote tumorigenesis by stimulating BRD4-dependent transcription.","Here the authors show mutation of the BAF chromatin remodeler subunit ARID1A results in an ARID1B-dependent upregulation of HERVH, an ERV required for the pluripotency regulatory network. These HERVH RNAs can partition into BRD4 foci, affecting BRD4-dependent transcription. Suppression of HERVH in colorectal cancer cells and patient-derived organoids impairs tumor growth.",2022-06-17
1949,"Therapeutic efficacy of combined active and passive immunization in ART-suppressed, SHIV-infected rhesus macaques","The latent viral reservoir is the critical barrier for developing an HIV-1 cure. Previous studies have shown that therapeutic vaccination or broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) administration, together with a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist, enhanced virologic control or delayed viral rebound, respectively, following discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in SIV- or SHIV-infected rhesus macaques. Here we show that the combination of active and passive immunization with vesatolimod may lead to higher rates of post-ART virologic control compared to either approach alone. Therapeutic Ad26/MVA vaccination and PGT121 administration together with TLR7 stimulation with vesatolimod resulted in 70% post-ART virologic control in SHIV-SF162P3-infected rhesus macaques. These data suggest the potential of combining active and passive immunization targeting different immunologic mechanisms as an HIV-1 cure strategy.","Antiretroviral therapy alone is insufficient in curing HIV-1 infection, due to latent viral reservoir persistency. Here, authors explore the post-virologic control of combining active and passive immunisation with vesatolimod, in a SHIV-infected rhesus macaque model.",2022-06-16
1950,Catalytical nano-immunocomplexes for remote-controlled sono-metabolic checkpoint trimodal cancer therapy,"Checkpoint immunotherapies have been combined with other therapeutic modalities to increase patient response rate and improve therapeutic outcome, which however exacerbates immune-related adverse events and requires to be carefully implemented in a narrowed therapeutic window. Strategies for precisely controlled combinational cancer immunotherapy can tackle this issue but remain lacking. We herein report a catalytical nano-immunocomplex for precise and persistent sono-metabolic checkpoint trimodal cancer therapy, whose full activities are only triggered by sono-irradiation in tumor microenvironment (TME). This nano-immunocomplex comprises three FDA-approved components, wherein checkpoint blockade inhibitor (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody), immunometabolic reprogramming enzyme (adenosine deaminase, ADA), and sonosensitizer (hematoporphyrin) are covalently immobilized into one entity via acid-cleavable and singlet oxygen-activatable linkers. Thus, the activities of the nano-immunocomplex are initially silenced, and only under sono-irradiation in the acidic TME, the sonodynamic, checkpoint blockade, and immunometabolic reprogramming activities are remotely awakened. Due to the enzymatic conversion of adenosine to inosine by ADA, the nano-immunocomplex can reduce levels of intratumoral adenosine and inhibit A2A/A2B adenosine receptors-adenosinergic signaling, leading to efficient activation of immune effector cells and inhibition of immune suppressor cells in vivo. Thus, this study presents a generic and translatable nanoplatform towards precision combinational cancer immunotherapy.",Ultrasound-based therapies in combination with immune checkpoint blockade have been shown to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Here the authors report the design of a pH-responsive and sono-irradiation activatable nanosystem functionalized with anti-PD-L1 and adenosine deaminase for sono-metabolic cancer immunotherapy.,2022-06-16
1951,Observation of anomalous amplitude modes in the kagome metal CsV3Sb5,"The kagome lattice provides a fertile platform to explore novel symmetry-breaking states. Charge-density wave (CDW) instabilities have been recently discovered in a new kagome metal family, commonly considered to arise from Fermi-surface instabilities. Here we report the observation of Raman-active CDW amplitude modes in CsV3Sb5, which are collective excitations typically thought to emerge out of frozen soft phonons, although phonon softening is elusive experimentally. The amplitude modes strongly hybridize with other superlattice modes, imparting them with clear temperature-dependent frequency shift and broadening, rarely seen in other known CDW materials. Both the mode mixing and the large amplitude mode frequencies suggest that the CDW exhibits the character of strong electron-phonon coupling, a regime in which phonon softening can cease to exist. Our work highlights the importance of the lattice degree of freedom in the CDW formation and points to the complex nature of the mechanism.","The mechanism of the charge density wave in kagome metals is not fully understood. Here, the authors report the observation of unusual large-frequency collective lattice excitations, or amplitude modes, in CsV3Sb5 in the absence of phonon mode softening, evidencing the strong electron-phonon coupling regime.",2022-06-16
1952,Generation and direct observation of a triplet arylnitrenium ion,"Nitrenium ions are important reactive intermediates in both chemistry and biology. Although singlet nitrenium ions are well-characterized by direct methods, the triplet states of nitrenium ions have never been directly detected. Here, we find that the excited state of the photoprecursor partitions between heterolysis to generate the singlet nitrenium ion and intersystem crossing (ISC) followed by a spontaneous heterolysis process to generate the triplet p-iodophenylnitrenium ion (np). The triplet nitrenium ion undergoes ISC to generate the ground singlet state, which ultimately undergoes proton and electron transfer to generate a long-lived radical cation that further generates the reduced p-iodoaniline. Ab Initio calculations were performed to map out the potential energy surfaces to better understand the excited state reactivity channels show that an energetically-accessible singlet-triplet crossing lies along the N-N stretch coordinate and that the excited triplet state is unbound and spontaneously eliminates ammonia to generate the triplet nitrenium ion. These results give a clearer picture of the photophysical properties and reactivity of two different spin states of a phenylnitrenium ion and provide the first direct glimpse of a triplet nitrenium ion.","Nitrenium ions are highly electrophilic reactive intermediates of formula R−N−R+, nitrogen analogue of carbenes. Here the authors report the detection of a triplet nitrenium ion using time-resolved spectroscopic methods and ab initio computations, allowing a glimpse at the properties and behavior of this important class of intermediates.",2022-06-16
1953,Pilot study of bempegaldesleukin in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic sarcoma,"PD-1 blockade (nivolumab) efficacy remains modest for metastatic sarcoma. In this paper, we present an open-label, non-randomized, non-comparative pilot study of bempegaldesleukin, a CD122-preferential interleukin-2 pathway agonist, with nivolumab in refractory sarcoma at Memorial Sloan Kettering/MD Anderson Cancer Centers (NCT03282344). We report on the primary outcome of objective response rate (ORR) and secondary endpoints of toxicity, clinical benefit, progression-free survival, overall survival, and durations of response/treatment. In 84 patients in 9 histotype cohorts, all patients experienced ≥1 adverse event and treatment-related adverse event; 1 death was possibly treatment-related. ORR was highest in angiosarcoma (3/8) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (2/10), meeting predefined endpoints. Results of our exploratory investigation of predictive biomarkers show: CD8 + T cell infiltrates and PD-1 expression correlate with improved ORR; upregulation of immune-related pathways correlate with improved efficacy; Hedgehog pathway expression correlate with resistance. Exploration of this combination in selected sarcomas, and of Hedgehog signaling as a predictive biomarker, warrants further study in larger cohorts.","The activity of PD-1 blockade in patients with sarcoma has been modest so far. Here, the authors report the results of a pilot clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of bempegaldesleukin, a CD122-preferential interleukin-2 (IL-2) pathway agonist, in combination with the PD1 blockade (nivolumab) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic high-grade sarcoma.",2022-06-16
1954,Influence maximization in Boolean networks,"The optimization problem aiming at the identification of minimal sets of nodes able to drive the dynamics of Boolean networks toward desired long-term behaviors is central for some applications, as for example the detection of key therapeutic targets to control pathways in models of biological signaling and regulatory networks. Here, we develop a method to solve such an optimization problem taking inspiration from the well-studied problem of influence maximization for spreading processes in social networks. We validate the method on small gene regulatory networks whose dynamical landscapes are known by means of brute-force analysis. We then systematically study a large collection of gene regulatory networks. We find that for about 65% of the analyzed networks, the minimal driver sets contain less than 20% of their nodes.","Boolean networks modelling various biological processes are characterized by nonlinear reversible dynamics that makes their control challenging. The authors introduce extended concepts of influence and control, typically considered in the study of spreading processes, for Boolean dynamics.",2022-06-16
1955,Ly6D+Siglec-H+ precursors contribute to conventional dendritic cells via a Zbtb46+Ly6D+ intermediary stage,Plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells (pDC and cDC) are generated from progenitor cells in the bone marrow and commitment to pDCs or cDC subtypes may occur in earlier and later progenitor stages. Cells within the CD11c+MHCII−/loSiglec-H+CCR9lo DC precursor fraction of the mouse bone marrow generate both pDCs and cDCs. Here we investigate the heterogeneity and commitment of subsets in this compartment by single-cell transcriptomics and high-dimensional flow cytometry combined with cell fate analysis: Within the CD11c+MHCII−/loSiglec-H+CCR9lo DC precursor pool cells expressing high levels of Ly6D and lacking expression of transcription factor Zbtb46 contain CCR9loB220hi immediate pDC precursors and CCR9loB220lo (lo-lo) cells which still generate pDCs and cDCs in vitro and in vivo under steady state conditions. cDC-primed cells within the Ly6DhiZbtb46– lo-lo precursors rapidly upregulate Zbtb46 and pass through a Zbtb46+Ly6D+ intermediate stage before acquiring cDC phenotype after cell division. Type I IFN stimulation limits cDC and promotes pDC output from this precursor fraction by arresting cDC-primed cells in the Zbtb46+Ly6D+ stage preventing their expansion and differentiation into cDCs. Modulation of pDC versus cDC output from precursors by external factors may allow for adaptation of DC subset composition at later differentiation stages.,The ontogeny of conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC) and how these two cell types are related is not fully known. Here the authors identify a pool of bone marrow precursor cells expressing Ly6D Siglec-H and Zbtb46 that can differentiate into either cDC or pDC and show that type I IFN can limit cDC and favor pDC output from these precursors.,2022-06-16
1956,T-cell trans-synaptic vesicles are distinct and carry greater effector content than constitutive extracellular vesicles,"The immunological synapse is a molecular hub that facilitates the delivery of three activation signals, namely antigen, costimulation/corepression and cytokines, from antigen-presenting cells (APC) to T cells. T cells release a fourth class of signaling entities, trans-synaptic vesicles (tSV), to mediate bidirectional communication. Here we present bead-supported lipid bilayers (BSLB) as versatile synthetic APCs to capture, characterize and advance the understanding of tSV biogenesis. Specifically, the integration of juxtacrine signals, such as CD40 and antigen, results in the adaptive tailoring and release of tSV, which differ in size, yields and immune receptor cargo compared with steadily released extracellular vesicles (EVs). Focusing on CD40L+ tSV as model effectors, we show that PD-L1 trans-presentation together with TSG101, ADAM10 and CD81 are key in determining CD40L vesicular release. Lastly, we find greater RNA-binding protein and microRNA content in tSV compared with EVs, supporting the specialized role of tSV as intercellular messengers.",T cells communicate with antigen-presenting cells (APC) via the signaling crosstalk at the immunological synapse (IS). Here the authors use bead-supported lipid bilayers as synthetic APCs to find that trans-synaptic vesicles produced by T cells in the IS carry specialized cargos distinct from constitutive extracellular vesicles to serve as intercellular messengers.,2022-06-16
1957,Light-sheet photonic force optical coherence elastography for high-throughput quantitative 3D micromechanical imaging,"Quantitative characterisation of micro-scale mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and dynamic cell-ECM interactions can significantly enhance fundamental discoveries and their translational potential in the rapidly growing field of mechanobiology. However, quantitative 3D imaging of ECM mechanics with cellular-scale resolution and dynamic monitoring of cell-mediated changes to pericellular viscoelasticity remain a challenge for existing mechanical characterisation methods. Here, we present light-sheet photonic force optical coherence elastography (LS-pfOCE) to address this need by leveraging a light-sheet for parallelised, non-invasive, and localised mechanical loading. We demonstrate the capabilities of LS-pfOCE by imaging the micromechanical heterogeneity of fibrous collagen matrices and perform live-cell imaging of cell-mediated ECM micromechanical dynamics. By providing access to 4D spatiotemporal variations in the micromechanical properties of 3D biopolymer constructs and engineered cellular systems, LS-pfOCE has the potential to drive new discoveries in mechanobiology and contribute to the development of novel biomechanics-based clinical diagnostics and therapies.",The authors introduce photonic force optical coherence elastography that uses a light-sheet for parallelised and localised mechanical loading. They demonstrate the combination of 3D imaging of extracellular matrix mechanics with cellular-scale resolution and dynamic monitoring of cell-mediated changes.,2022-06-16
1958,Terahertz thermal curve analysis for label-free identification of pathogens,"In this study, we perform a thermal curve analysis with terahertz (THz) metamaterials to develop a label-free identification tool for pathogens such as bacteria and yeasts. The resonant frequency of the metasensor coated with a bacterial layer changes as a function of temperature; this provides a unique fingerprint specific to the individual microbial species without the use of fluorescent dyes and antibodies. Differential thermal curves obtained from the temperature-dependent resonance exhibit the peaks consistent with bacterial phases, such as growth, thermal inactivation, DNA denaturation, and cell wall destruction. In addition, we can distinguish gram-negative bacteria from gram-positive bacteria which show strong peaks in the temperature range of cell wall destruction. Finally, we perform THz melting curve analysis on the mixture of bacterial species in which the pathogenic bacteria are successfully distinguished from each other, which is essential for practical clinical and environmental applications such as in blood culture.",A label-free sensing method has been developed for identifying hazardous pathogens based on their intrinsic properties. This was possible by interrogating the temperature-dependent dielectric constant of the microbes in the far-infrared range.,2022-06-16
1959,Coordination chemogenetics for activation of GPCR-type glutamate receptors in brain tissue,"Direct activation of cell-surface receptors is highly desirable for elucidating their physiological roles. A potential approach for cell-type-specific activation of a receptor subtype is chemogenetics, in which both point mutagenesis of the receptors and designed ligands are used. However, ligand-binding properties are affected in most cases. Here, we developed a chemogenetic method for direct activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1), which plays essential roles in cerebellar functions in the brain. Our screening identified a mGlu1 mutant, mGlu1(N264H), that was activated directly by palladium complexes. A palladium complex showing low cytotoxicity successfully activated mGlu1 in mGlu1(N264H) knock-in mice, revealing that activation of endogenous mGlu1 is sufficient to evoke the critical cellular mechanism of synaptic plasticity, a basis of motor learning in the cerebellum. Moreover, cell-type-specific activation of mGlu1 was demonstrated successfully using adeno-associated viruses in mice, which shows the potential utility of this chemogenetics for clarifying the physiological roles of mGlu1 in a cell-type-specific manner.","Cell-type-specific activation of receptors is desirable for elucidating their roles in tissues or animals.

1960,Taming the radical cation intermediate enabled one-step access to structurally diverse lignans,"Lignans, in spite of their structural diversity, are all biosynthetically derived from coniferyl alcohol. We report herein a divergent synthesis of lignans from biomass-derived monolignols in a short synthetic sequence. Blue LED irradiation of a dichloromethane solution of dicinnamyl ether derivatives in the presence of Cu(TFA)2, an alcohol (2.0 equiv) and a catalytic amount of Fukuzumi’s salt affords the C7-alkoxylated aryltetralin cyclic ethers. Increasing the amount of alcohol under otherwise identical conditions diverts the reaction course to furnish the C7,C7’-dialkoxylated dibenzyltetrahydrofurans, while replacing Cu(TFA)2 with diphenyl disulfide (PhSSPh) provides selectively the C7-monoalkoxylated dibenzyltetrahydrofurans. Aza-, thia- and carba-analogues of lignans are equally accessible by simply changing the tethering atom of the allylic alcohols. Concise total syntheses of aglacins A, E, F, brassilignan, and dehydrodimethylconidendrin are documented featuring these transformations.","Lignans, in spite of their structural diversity, are all biosynthetically derived from coniferyl alcohol.

1961,Disentangling the genetic basis of rhizosphere microbiome assembly in tomato,"Microbiomes play a pivotal role in plant growth and health, but the genetic factors involved in microbiome assembly remain largely elusive. Here, we map the molecular features of the rhizosphere microbiome as quantitative traits of a diverse hybrid population of wild and domesticated tomato. Gene content analysis of prioritized tomato quantitative trait loci suggests a genetic basis for differential recruitment of various rhizobacterial lineages, including a Streptomyces-associated 6.31 Mbp region harboring tomato domestication sweeps and encoding, among others, the iron regulator FIT and the water channel aquaporin SlTIP2.3. Within metagenome-assembled genomes of root-associated Streptomyces and Cellvibrio, we identify bacterial genes involved in metabolism of plant polysaccharides, iron, sulfur, trehalose, and vitamins, whose genetic variation associates with specific tomato QTLs. By integrating ‘microbiomics’ and quantitative plant genetics, we pinpoint putative plant and reciprocal rhizobacterial traits underlying microbiome assembly, thereby providing a first step towards plant-microbiome breeding programs.","Genetics factors involved in rhizosphere microbiomes assembly remain largely elusive.

1962,The impact of species-wide gene expression variation on Caenorhabditis elegans complex traits,"Phenotypic variation in organism-level traits has been studied in Caenorhabditis elegans wild strains, but the impacts of differences in gene expression and the underlying regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we use natural variation in gene expression to connect genetic variants to differences in organismal-level traits, including drug and toxicant responses. We perform transcriptomic analyses on 207 genetically distinct C. elegans wild strains to study natural regulatory variation of gene expression. Using this massive dataset, we perform genome-wide association mappings to investigate the genetic basis underlying gene expression variation and reveal complex genetic architectures. We find a large collection of hotspots enriched for expression quantitative trait loci across the genome. We further use mediation analysis to understand how gene expression variation could underlie organism-level phenotypic variation for a variety of complex traits. These results reveal the natural diversity in gene expression and possible regulatory mechanisms in this keystone model organism, highlighting the promise of using gene expression variation to understand how phenotypic diversity is generated.","Gene expression links genomic variation to organismal trait differences. Here, the authors identify regulatory loci underlying gene expression variation in C. elegans and demonstrate how this variation could impact other complex traits.",2022-06-16
1963,A hexa-species transcriptome atlas of mammalian embryogenesis delineates metabolic regulation across three different implantation modes,"Mammalian embryogenesis relies on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to balance the generation of biomass with energy production. However, the dynamics of metabolic regulation in the postimplantation embryo in vivo have remained elusive due to the inaccessibility of the implanted conceptus for biochemical studies. To address this issue, we compiled single-cell embryo profiling data in six mammalian species and determined their metabolic dynamics through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation associated gene expression. Strikingly, we identify a conserved switch from bivalent respiration in the late blastocyst towards a glycolytic metabolism in early gastrulation stages across species, which is independent of embryo implantation. Extraembryonic lineages followed the dynamics of the embryonic lineage, except visceral endoderm. Finally, we demonstrate that in vitro primate embryo culture substantially impacts metabolic gene regulation by comparison to in vivo samples. Our work reveals a conserved metabolic programme despite different implantation modes and highlights the need to optimise postimplantation embryo culture protocols.","Mammalian embryogenesis relies on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, but understanding of the dynamics of metabolic regulation in the postimplantation embryo in vivo remains elusive.

1964,Regional and seasonal partitioning of water and temperature controls on global land carbon uptake variability,"Global fluctuations in annual land carbon uptake (NEEIAV) depend on water and temperature variability, yet debate remains about local and seasonal controls of the global dependences. Here, we quantify regional and seasonal contributions to the correlations of globally-averaged NEEIAV against terrestrial water storage (TWS) and temperature, and respective uncertainties, using three approaches: atmospheric inversions, process-based vegetation models, and data-driven models. The three approaches agree that the tropics contribute over 63% of the global correlations, but differ on the dominant driver of the global NEEIAV, because they disagree on seasonal temperature effects in the Northern Hemisphere (NH, >25°N). In the NH, inversions and process-based models show inter-seasonal compensation of temperature effects, inducing a global TWS dominance supported by observations. Data-driven models show weaker seasonal compensation, thereby estimating a global temperature dominance. We provide a roadmap to fully understand drivers of global NEEIAV and discuss their implications for future carbon–climate feedbacks.",The dominant driver of variations in global land carbon sink remains unclear. Here the authors show that the seasonal compensation of temperature effects on land carbon sink in the Northern Hemisphere could induce a global water dominance.,2022-06-16
1965,Study of the doubly charmed tetraquark \({{{{{{\rm{T}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\rm{c}}}}}}{{{{{\rm{c}}}}}}}^{+}\),"Quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong force, describes interactions of coloured quarks and gluons and the formation of hadronic matter. Conventional hadronic matter consists of baryons and mesons made of three quarks and quark-antiquark pairs, respectively. Particles with an alternative quark content are known as exotic states. Here a study is reported of an exotic narrow state in the D0D0π+ mass spectrum just below the D*+D0 mass threshold produced in proton-proton collisions collected with the LHCb detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The state is consistent with the ground isoscalar \({{{{{{\rm{T}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\rm{c}}}}}}{{{{{\rm{c}}}}}}}^{+}\) tetraquark with a quark content of \({{{{{\rm{c}}}}}}{{{{{\rm{c}}}}}}\overline{{{{{{\rm{u}}}}}}}\overline{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}\) and spin-parity quantum numbers JP = 1+. Study of the DD mass spectra disfavours interpretation of the resonance as the isovector state. The decay structure via intermediate off-shell D*+ mesons is consistent with the observed D0π+ mass distribution. To analyse the mass of the resonance and its coupling to the D*D system, a dedicated model is developed under the assumption of an isoscalar axial-vector \({{{{{{\rm{T}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\rm{c}}}}}}{{{{{\rm{c}}}}}}}^{+}\) state decaying to the D*D channel.

1966,Single-cell profiling of the antigen-specific response to BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine,"RNA-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have proven critical to limiting COVID-19 disease severity and spread. Cellular mechanisms driving antigen-specific responses to these vaccines, however, remain uncertain. Here we identify and characterize antigen-specific cells and antibody responses to the RNA vaccine BNT162b2 using multiple single-cell technologies for in depth analysis of longitudinal samples from a cohort of healthy participants. Mass cytometry and unbiased machine learning pinpoint an expanding, population of antigen-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with characteristics of follicular or peripheral helper cells. B cell receptor sequencing suggest progression from IgM, with apparent cross-reactivity to endemic coronaviruses, to SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG memory B cells and plasmablasts. Responding lymphocyte populations correlate with eventual SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and a participant lacking these cell populations failed to sustain SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and experienced breakthrough infection. These integrated proteomic and genomic platforms identify an antigen-specific cellular basis of RNA vaccine-based immunity.",Vaccination against COVID-19 has shown activation of different immune cell types. Here the authors characterise the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine using longitudinal CyTOF single cell approaches to characterise antigen specific B and T-cell responses promoted by this vaccine.,2022-06-16
1967,Sustainable power generation for at least one month from ambient humidity using unique nanofluidic diode,"The continuous energy-harvesting in moisture environment is attractive for the development of clean energy source. Controlling the transport of ionized mobile charge in intelligent nanoporous membrane systems is a promising strategy to develop the moisture-enabled electric generator. However, existing designs still suffer from low output power density. Moreover, these devices can only produce short-term (mostly a few seconds or a few hours, rarely for a few days) voltage and current output in the ambient environment. Here, we show an ionic diode–type hybrid membrane capable of continuously generating energy in the ambient environment. The built-in electric field of the nanofluidic diode-type PN junction helps the selective ions separation and the steady-state one-way ion charge transfer. This directional ion migration is further converted to electron transportation at the surface of electrodes via oxidation-reduction reaction and charge adsorption, thus resulting in a continuous voltage and current with high energy conversion efficiency.",Energy harvesting of humidity present in air can be used for the development of clean energy sources and self-sustained systems. The authors propose a nanofluid energy conversion system with integrated ionic diode-type hybrid membrane for energy generation in environmental moisture.,2022-06-16
1968,Statistical considerations of nonrandom treatment applications reveal region-wide benefits of widespread post-fire restoration action,"Accurate predictions of ecological restoration outcomes are needed across the increasingly large landscapes requiring treatment following disturbances. However, observational studies often fail to account for nonrandom treatment application, which can result in invalid inference. Examining a spatiotemporally extensive management treatment involving post-fire seeding of declining sagebrush shrubs across semiarid areas of the western USA over two decades, we quantify drivers and consequences of selection biases in restoration using remotely sensed data. From following more than 1,500 wildfires, we find treatments were disproportionately applied in more stressful, degraded ecological conditions. Failure to incorporate unmeasured drivers of treatment allocation led to the conclusion that costly, widespread seedings were unsuccessful; however, after considering sources of bias, restoration positively affected sagebrush recovery. Treatment effects varied with climate, indicating prioritization criteria for interventions. Our findings revise the perspective that post-fire sagebrush seedings have been broadly unsuccessful and demonstrate how selection biases can pose substantive inferential hazards in observational studies of restoration efficacy and the development of restoration theory.","Postfire sagebrush seeding treatments are widely applied across the western USA but evidence for the success of this restoration approach has been variable. Examining >1500 wildfires, this study shows that positive treatment effects were only detected after considering systematic differences between treated and untreated sites due to effects of selection biases in restoration.",2022-06-16
1969,Identifying plant genes shaping microbiota composition in the barley rhizosphere,"A prerequisite to exploiting soil microbes for sustainable crop production is the identification of the plant genes shaping microbiota composition in the rhizosphere, the interface between roots and soil. Here, we use metagenomics information as an external quantitative phenotype to map the host genetic determinants of the rhizosphere microbiota in wild and domesticated genotypes of barley, the fourth most cultivated cereal globally. We identify a small number of loci with a major effect on the composition of rhizosphere communities. One of those, designated the QRMC-3HS, emerges as a major determinant of microbiota composition. We subject soil-grown sibling lines harbouring contrasting alleles at QRMC-3HS and hosting contrasting microbiotas to comparative root RNA-seq profiling. This allows us to identify three primary candidate genes, including a Nucleotide-Binding-Leucine-Rich-Repeat (NLR) gene in a region of structural variation of the barley genome. Our results provide insights into the footprint of crop improvement on the plant’s capacity of shaping rhizosphere microbes.","A prerequisite to exploiting soil microbes for sustainable crop production is the identification of the plant genes shaping microbiota composition in the rhizosphere.

1970,Phasing analysis of lung cancer genomes using a long read sequencer,"Chromosomal backgrounds of cancerous mutations still remain elusive. Here, we conduct the phasing analysis of non-small cell lung cancer specimens of 20 Japanese patients. By the combinatory use of short and long read sequencing data, we obtain long phased blocks of 834 kb in N50 length with >99% concordance rate. By analyzing the obtained phasing information, we reveal that several cancer genomes harbor regions in which mutations are unevenly distributed to either of two haplotypes. Large-scale chromosomal rearrangement events, which resemble chromothripsis events but have smaller scales, occur on only one chromosome, and these events account for the observed biased distributions. Interestingly, the events are characteristic of EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinomas. Further integration of long read epigenomic and transcriptomic data reveal that haploid chromosomes are not always at equivalent transcriptomic/epigenomic conditions. Distinct chromosomal backgrounds are responsible for later cancerous aberrations in a haplotype-specific manner.","Long-read sequencing technologies are useful for the multifaceted task of characterising somatic mutations, including structural variants, in cancers. Here, the authors combine short and long read sequencing for the phasing analysis, which enables them to resolve the chromosomal backgrounds of somatic mutations in Japanese non-small cell lung cancers.",2022-06-16
1971,Effective lifting of the topological protection of quantum spin Hall edge states by edge coupling,"The scientific interest in two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) is currently shifting from a more fundamental perspective to the exploration and design of novel functionalities. Key concepts for the use of 2D TIs in spintronics are based on the topological protection and spin-momentum locking of their helical edge states. In this study we present experimental evidence that topological protection can be (partially) lifted by pairwise coupling of 2D TI edges in close proximity. Using direct wave function mapping via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) we compare isolated and coupled topological edges in the 2D TI bismuthene. The latter situation is realized by natural lattice line defects and reveals distinct quasi-particle interference (QPI) patterns, identified as electronic Fabry-Pérot resonator modes. In contrast, free edges show no sign of any single-particle backscattering. These results pave the way for novel device concepts based on active control of topological protection through inter-edge hybridization for, e.g., electronic Fabry-Pérot interferometry.","New functionalities of two-dimensional topological insulators (2DTI) are of current scientific interest. Here, the authors show that topological protection can be lifted by pairwise coupling of 2DTI bismuthene edges in close proximity.",2022-06-16
1972,Ductile deformation during carbonation of serpentinized peridotite,"Carbonated serpentinites (listvenites) in the Samail Ophiolite, Oman, record mineralization of 1–2 Gt of CO2, but the mechanisms providing permeability for continued reactive fluid flow are unclear. Based on samples of the Oman Drilling Project, here we show that listvenites with a penetrative foliation have abundant microstructures indicating that the carbonation reaction occurred during deformation. Folded magnesite veins mark the onset of carbonation, followed by deformation during carbonate growth. Undeformed magnesite and quartz overgrowths indicate that deformation stopped before the reaction was completed. We propose deformation by dilatant granular flow and dissolution-precipitation assisted the reaction, while deformation in turn was localized in the weak reacting mass. Lithostatic pore pressures promoted this process, creating dilatant porosity for CO2 transport and solid volume increase. This feedback mechanism may be common in serpentinite-bearing fault zones and the mantle wedge overlying subduction zones, allowing massive carbonation of mantle rocks.",Mantle rocks can efficiently bind carbon by reaction with CO2 if fluid pathways remain open. This study of samples from Oman demonstrates that coupling of synchronous reaction and deformation facilitates fluid flow and massive carbon sequestration.,2022-06-16
1973,The 3D architecture of the pepper genome and its relationship to function and evolution,"The organization of chromatin into self-interacting domains is universal among eukaryotic genomes, though how and why they form varies considerably. Here we report a chromosome-scale reference genome assembly of pepper (Capsicum annuum) and explore its 3D organization through integrating high-resolution Hi-C maps with epigenomic, transcriptomic, and genetic variation data. Chromatin folding domains in pepper are as prominent as TADs in mammals but exhibit unique characteristics. They tend to coincide with heterochromatic regions enriched with retrotransposons and are frequently embedded in loops, which may correlate with transcription factories. Their boundaries are hotspots for chromosome rearrangements but are otherwise depleted for genetic variation. While chromatin conformation broadly affects transcription variance, it does not predict differential gene expression between tissues. Our results suggest that pepper genome organization is explained by a model of heterochromatin-driven folding promoted by transcription factories and that such spatial architecture is under structural and functional constraints.","The organization of chromatin into self-interacting domains is universal among eukaryotic genomes. Here, the authors report a reference-grade pepper genome assembly and use this reference to help describe the relationship among 3D chromatin conformation, chromatin function, and gene expression.",2022-06-16
1974,GPI-anchored FGF directs cytoneme-mediated bidirectional contacts to regulate its tissue-specific dispersion,"How signaling proteins generate a multitude of information to organize tissue patterns is critical to understanding morphogenesis. In Drosophila, FGF produced in wing-disc cells regulates the development of the disc-associated air-sac-primordium (ASP). Here, we show that FGF is Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored to the producing cell surface and that this modification both inhibits free FGF secretion and promotes target-specific cytoneme contacts and contact-dependent FGF release. FGF-source and ASP cells extend cytonemes that present FGF and FGFR on their surfaces and reciprocally recognize each other over distance by contacting through cell-adhesion-molecule (CAM)-like FGF-FGFR binding. Contact-mediated FGF-FGFR interactions induce bidirectional responses in ASP and source cells that, in turn, polarize FGF-sending and FGF-receiving cytonemes toward each other to reinforce signaling contacts. Subsequent un-anchoring of FGFR-bound-FGF from the source membrane dissociates cytoneme contacts and delivers FGF target-specifically to ASP cytonemes for paracrine functions. Thus, GPI-anchored FGF organizes both source and recipient cells and self-regulates its cytoneme-mediated tissue-specific dispersion.","Cytonemes are signaling filopodia that mediate target-specific long-distance communications of signals like FGFs. Du et al. show that a Drosophila FGF is anchored to the FGF-producing cell surface, inhibiting free FGF secretion and activating contact-dependent bidirectional FGF-FGFR interactions, controlling target-specific cytoneme contacts and contact-dependent FGF release.",2022-06-16
1975,Sex-specific multi-level 3D genome dynamics in the mouse brain,"The female mammalian brain exhibits sex hormone-driven plasticity during the reproductive period. Recent evidence implicates chromatin dynamics in gene regulation underlying this plasticity. However, whether ovarian hormones impact higher-order chromatin organization in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is unknown. Here, we mapped the 3D genome of ventral hippocampal neurons across the oestrous cycle and by sex in mice. In females, we find cycle-driven dynamism in 3D chromatin organization, including in oestrogen response elements-enriched X chromosome compartments, autosomal CTCF loops, and enhancer-promoter interactions. With rising oestrogen levels, the female 3D genome becomes more similar to the male 3D genome. Cyclical enhancer-promoter interactions are partially associated with gene expression and enriched for brain disorder-relevant genes and pathways. Our study reveals unique 3D genome dynamics in the female brain relevant to female-specific gene regulation, neuroplasticity, and disease risk.","Here the authors provide evidence that 3D chromatin structure in the mouse brain differs between males and females and undergoes dynamic remodelling during the female ovarian cycle. They show female-specific 3D genome dynamics affects neuronal gene expression and brain disorder-relevant genes, and could play a role in reproductive hormone-induced brain plasticity and female-specific risk for brain disorders.",2022-06-15
1976,Structural basis of rapid actin dynamics in the evolutionarily divergent Leishmania parasite,"Actin polymerization generates forces for cellular processes throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, but our understanding of the ‘ancient’ actin turnover machineries is limited. We show that, despite > 1 billion years of evolution, pathogenic Leishmania major parasite and mammalian actins share the same overall fold and co-polymerize with each other. Interestingly, Leishmania harbors a simple actin-regulatory machinery that lacks cofilin ‘cofactors’, which accelerate filament disassembly in higher eukaryotes. By applying single-filament biochemistry we discovered that, compared to mammalian proteins, Leishmania actin filaments depolymerize more rapidly from both ends, and are severed > 100-fold more efficiently by cofilin. Our high-resolution cryo-EM structures of Leishmania ADP-, ADP-Pi- and cofilin-actin filaments identify specific features at actin subunit interfaces and cofilin-actin interactions that explain the unusually rapid dynamics of parasite actin filaments. Our findings reveal how divergent parasites achieve rapid actin dynamics using a remarkably simple set of actin-binding proteins, and elucidate evolution of the actin cytoskeleton.","The authors report here the structure-function analysis of highly divergent actin from Leishmania parasite. The study reveals remarkably rapid dynamics of parasite actin as well as the underlying molecular basis, thus providing insight into evolution of the actin cytoskeleton.",2022-06-15
1977,Remote solid cancers rewire hepatic nitrogen metabolism via host nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase,"Cancers disrupt host homeostasis in various manners but the identity of host factors underlying such disruption remains largely unknown. Here we show that nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is a host factor that mediates metabolic dysfunction in the livers of cancer-bearing mice. Multiple solid cancers distantly increase expression of Nnmt and its product 1-methylnicotinamide (MNAM) in the liver. Multi-omics analyses reveal suppression of the urea cycle accompanied by accumulation of amino acids, and enhancement of uracil biogenesis in the livers of cancer-bearing mice. Importantly, genetic deletion of Nnmt leads to alleviation of these metabolic abnormalities, and buffers cancer-dependent weight loss and reduction of the voluntary wheel-running activity. Our data also demonstrate that MNAM is capable of affecting urea cycle metabolites in the liver. These results suggest that cancers up-regulate the hepatic NNMT pathway to rewire liver metabolism towards uracil biogenesis rather than nitrogen disposal via the urea cycle, thereby disrupting host homeostasis.","The presence of cancer can induce systemic disruption of the host homeostasis. Here, the authors show that different solid tumours remotely increase hepatic nicotinamide-Nmethyltransferase disrupting the host urea cycle metabolism in the liver.",2022-06-15
1978,Organic donor-acceptor heterojunctions for high performance circularly polarized light detection,"Development of highly efficient and stable lateral organic circularly polarized light photodetector is a fundamental prerequisite for realization of circularly polarized light integrated applications. However, chiral semiconductors with helical structure are usually found with intrinsically low field-effect mobilities, which becomes a bottleneck for high-performance and multi-wavelength circularly polarized light detection. To address this problem, here we demonstrate a novel strategy to fabricate multi-wavelength circularly polarized light photodetector based on the donor-acceptor heterojunction, where efficient exciton separation enables chiral acceptor layer to provide differentiated concentration of holes to the channel of organic field-effect transistors. Benefitting from the low defect density at the semiconductor/dielectric interface, the photodetectors exhibit excellent stability, enabling current roll-off of about 3–4% over 500 cycles. The photocurrent dissymmetry value and responsivity for circularly polarized light photodetector in air are 0.24 and 0.28 A W−1, respectively. We further demonstrate circularly polarized light communication based on a real-time circularly polarized light detector by decoding the light signal. As the proof-of-concept, the results hold the promise of large-scale circularly polarized light integrated photonic applications.","Here, the authors report a strategy to fabricate multi-wavelength circularly polarized light photodetectors consisting of bilayer donor-acceptor heterojunctions with chiral active layers.",2022-06-15
1979,"Deciphering the phase transition-induced ultrahigh piezoresponse in (K,Na)NbO3-based piezoceramics","Here, we introduce phase change mechanisms in lead-free piezoceramics as a strategy to utilize attendant volume change for harvesting large electrostrain. In the newly developed (K,Na)NbO3 solid-solution at the polymorphic phase boundary we combine atomic mapping of the local polar vector with in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and density functional theory to uncover the phase change and interpret its underlying nature. We demonstrate that an electric field-induced phase transition between orthorhombic and tetragonal phases triggers a dramatic volume change and contributes to a huge effective piezoelectric coefficient of 1250 pm V−1 along specific crystallographic directions. The existence of the phase transition is validated by a significant volume change evidenced by the simultaneous recording of macroscopic longitudinal and transverse strain. The principle of using phase transition to promote electrostrain provides broader design flexibility in the development of high-performance piezoelectric materials and opens the door for the discovery of high-performance future functional oxides.","Functional oxides with coexisting states of comparable energy typically exhibit extraordinary responses to external stimuli. Here, the authors demonstrate that coexisting phase structures provide large electric field-triggered volume change.",2022-06-15
1980,Disease modeling by efficient genome editing using a near PAM-less base editor in vivo,"Base Editors are emerging as an innovative technology to introduce point mutations in complex genomes. So far, the requirement of an NGG Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) at a suitable position often limits the base editing possibility to model human pathological mutations in animals. Here we show that, using the CBE4max-SpRY variant recognizing nearly all PAM sequences, we could introduce point mutations for the first time in an animal model with high efficiency, thus drastically increasing the base editing possibilities. With this near PAM-less base editor we could simultaneously mutate several genes and we developed a co-selection method to identify the most edited embryos based on a simple visual screening. Finally, we apply our method to create a zebrafish model for melanoma predisposition based on the simultaneous base editing of multiple genes. Altogether, our results considerably expand the Base Editor application to introduce human disease-causing mutations in zebrafish.",Base Editors are emerging as an innovative technology to introduce point mutations in complex genomes.

1981,Clinical sequencing of soft tissue and bone sarcomas delineates diverse genomic landscapes and potential therapeutic targets,"The genetic, biologic, and clinical heterogeneity of sarcomas poses a challenge for the identification of therapeutic targets, clinical research, and advancing patient care. Because there are > 100 sarcoma subtypes, in-depth genetic studies have focused on one or a few subtypes. Herein, we report a comparative genetic analysis of 2,138 sarcomas representing 45 pathological entities. This cohort is prospectively analyzed using targeted sequencing to characterize subtype-specific somatic alterations in targetable pathways, rates of whole genome doubling, mutational signatures, and subtype-agnostic genomic clusters. The most common alterations are in cell cycle control and TP53, receptor tyrosine kinases/PI3K/RAS, and epigenetic regulators. Subtype-specific associations include TERT amplification in intimal sarcoma and SWI/SNF alterations in uterine adenosarcoma. Tumor mutational burden, while low compared to other cancers, varies between and within subtypes. This resource will improve sarcoma models, motivate studies of subtype-specific alterations, and inform investigations of genetic factors and their correlations with treatment response.","Sarcomas are rare tumours with many different subtypes and clinical outcomes; a broader knowledge of their genetic features is required.

1982,Pre-existing antibody levels negatively correlate with antibody titers after a single dose of BBV152 vaccination,"Many adults in India have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine with or without a prior history SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is limited information on the effect of prior immunity on antibody response upon vaccination in India. As immunization of individuals continues, we aimed to assess whether pre-existing antibodies are further boosted by a single dose of BBV152, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and, if these antibodies can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants. Here we show that natural infection during the second wave in 2021 led to generation of neutralizing antibodies against other lineages of SARS-CoV-2 including the Omicron variant, albeit at a significantly lower level for the latter. A single dose of BBV152 boosted antibody titers against the Delta and the Omicron variants but the antibody levels remained low against the Omicron variant. Boosting of antibodies showed negative correlation with baseline neutralizing antibody titers.","Serosurveillance studies show a heterogenous mix of the Indian population with immunity to COVID-19 due to vaccination or natural infection.

1983,Clinical genomic profiling in the management of patients with soft tissue and bone sarcoma,"There are more than 70 distinct sarcomas, and this diversity complicates the development of precision-based therapeutics for these cancers. Prospective comprehensive genomic profiling could overcome this challenge by providing insight into sarcomas’ molecular drivers. Through targeted panel sequencing of 7494 sarcomas representing 44 histologies, we identify highly recurrent and type-specific alterations that aid in diagnosis and treatment decisions. Sequencing could lead to refinement or reassignment of 10.5% of diagnoses. Nearly one-third of patients (31.7%) harbor potentially actionable alterations, including a significant proportion (2.6%) with kinase gene rearrangements; 3.9% have a tumor mutational burden ≥10 mut/Mb. We describe low frequencies of microsatellite instability (<0.3%) and a high degree of genome-wide loss of heterozygosity (15%) across sarcomas, which are not readily explained by homologous recombination deficiency (observed in 2.5% of cases). In a clinically annotated subset of 118 patients, we validate actionable genetic events as therapeutic targets. Collectively, our findings reveal the genetic landscape of human sarcomas, which may inform future development of therapeutics and improve clinical outcomes for patients with these rare cancers.","Comprehensive molecular profiles are required to understand and treat sarcomas, which comprise more than 70 different subtypes.

1984,Genetic subtypes of smoldering multiple myeloma are associated with distinct pathogenic phenotypes and clinical outcomes,"Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a precursor condition of multiple myeloma (MM) with significant heterogeneity in disease progression. Existing clinical models of progression risk do not fully capture this heterogeneity. Here we integrate 42 genetic alterations from 214 SMM patients using unsupervised binary matrix factorization (BMF) clustering and identify six distinct genetic subtypes. These subtypes are differentially associated with established MM-related RNA signatures, oncogenic and immune transcriptional profiles, and evolving clinical biomarkers. Three genetic subtypes are associated with increased risk of progression to active MM in both the primary and validation cohorts, indicating they can be used to better predict high and low-risk patients within the currently used clinical risk stratification models.","Existing clinical models cannot fully capture smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) heterogeneity.

Here, through multivariate genome-wide association analysis in volumetric data from 35,411 white British individuals, we reveal 177 unique genetic loci with distributed associations across the hippocampal formation. We identify genetic overlap with eight brain disorders with typical onset at different stages of life, where common genes suggest partly age- and disorder-independent mechanisms underlying hippocampal pathology.","The hippocampus has been associated with memory traits and a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

1986,Challenging the highstand-dormant paradigm for land-detached submarine canyons,"Sediment, nutrients, organic carbon and pollutants are funnelled down submarine canyons from continental shelves by sediment-laden flows called turbidity currents, which dominate particulate transfer to the deep sea. Post-glacial sea-level rise disconnected more than three quarters of the >9000 submarine canyons worldwide from their former river or long-shore drift sediment inputs. Existing models therefore assume that land-detached submarine canyons are dormant in the present-day; however, monitoring has focused on land-attached canyons and this paradigm remains untested. Here we present the most detailed field measurements yet of turbidity currents within a land-detached submarine canyon, documenting a remarkably similar frequency (6 yr−1) and speed (up to 5–8 ms−1) to those in large land-attached submarine canyons. Major triggers such as storms or earthquakes are not required; instead, seasonal variations in cross-shelf sediment transport explain temporal-clustering of flows, and why the storm season is surprisingly absent of turbidity currents. As >1000 other canyons have a similar configuration, we propose that contemporary deep-sea particulate transport via such land-detached canyons may have been dramatically under-estimated.",Powerful avalanches were recorded for the first time in an underwater canyon that lies 100 s of km from land. This challenges a long-held view and indicates > 1000 similar canyons worldwide actively pump sediment and pollutants into the deep-sea.,2022-06-15
1987,Complete biosynthetic pathway to the antidiabetic drug acarbose,"Acarbose is a bacterial-derived α-glucosidase inhibitor clinically used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. As type 2 diabetes is on the rise worldwide, the market demand for acarbose has also increased. Despite its significant therapeutic importance, how it is made in nature is not completely understood. Here, we report the complete biosynthetic pathway to acarbose and its structural components, GDP-valienol and O-4-amino-(4,6-dideoxy-α-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1→4)-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose. GDP-valienol is derived from valienol 7-phosphate, catalyzed by three cyclitol modifying enzymes, whereas O-4-amino-(4,6-dideoxy-α-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1→4)-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose is produced from dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose and maltose by the glycosyltransferase AcbI. The final assembly process is catalyzed by a pseudoglycosyltransferase enzyme, AcbS, which is a homologue of AcbI but catalyzes the formation of a non-glycosidic C-N bond. This study clarifies all previously unknown steps in acarbose biosynthesis and establishes a complete pathway to this high value pharmaceutical.","The market demand for acarbose, a drug used for treatment of patients affected by type-2 diabetes, has increased.

1988,Excited state non-adiabatic dynamics of large photoswitchable molecules using a chemically transferable machine learning potential,"Light-induced chemical processes are ubiquitous in nature and have widespread technological applications. For example, photoisomerization can allow a drug with a photo-switchable scaffold such as azobenzene to be activated with light. In principle, photoswitches with desired photophysical properties like high isomerization quantum yields can be identified through virtual screening with reactive simulations. In practice, these simulations are rarely used for screening, since they require hundreds of trajectories and expensive quantum chemical methods to account for non-adiabatic excited state effects. Here we introduce a diabatic artificial neural network (DANN), based on diabatic states, to accelerate such simulations for azobenzene derivatives. The network is six orders of magnitude faster than the quantum chemistry method used for training. DANN is transferable to azobenzene molecules outside the training set, predicting quantum yields for unseen species that are correlated with experiment. We use the model to virtually screen 3100 hypothetical molecules, and identify novel species with high predicted quantum yields. The model predictions are confirmed using high-accuracy non-adiabatic dynamics. Our results pave the way for fast and accurate virtual screening of photoactive compounds.","The authors introduce a diabatic neural network to accelerate excitedstate, non-adiabatic simulations of azobenzene derivatives. The model predicts quantum yields for unseen species that are correlated with experiment.",2022-06-15
1989,Effect of the grain arrangements on the thermal stability of polycrystalline nickel-rich lithium-based battery cathodes,"One of the most challenging aspects of developing high-energy lithium-based batteries is the structural and (electro)chemical stability of Ni-rich active cathode materials at thermally-abused and prolonged cell cycling conditions. Here, we report in situ physicochemical characterizations to improve the fundamental understanding of the degradation mechanism of charged polycrystalline Ni-rich cathodes at elevated temperatures (e.g., ≥ 40 °C). Using multiple microscopy, scattering, thermal, and electrochemical probes, we decouple the major contributors for the thermal instability from intertwined factors. Our research work demonstrates that the grain microstructures play an essential role in the thermal stability of polycrystalline lithium-based positive battery electrodes. We also show that the oxygen release, a crucial process during battery thermal runaway, can be regulated by engineering grain arrangements. Furthermore, the grain arrangements can also modulate the macroscopic crystallographic transformation pattern and oxygen diffusion length in layered oxide cathode materials.","Enhancing the stability of positive electrodes at thermally-abused conditions is vital for next-generation lithium-based batteries.

1990,Cas9-induced large deletions and small indels are controlled in a convergent fashion,"Repair of Cas9-induced double-stranded breaks results primarily in formation of small insertions and deletions (indels), but can also cause potentially harmful large deletions. While mechanisms leading to the creation of small indels are relatively well understood, very little is known about the origins of large deletions. Using a library of clonal NGS-validated mouse embryonic stem cells deficient for 32 DNA repair genes, we have shown that large deletion frequency increases in cells impaired for non-homologous end joining and decreases in cells deficient for the central resection gene Nbn and the microhomology-mediated end joining gene Polq. Across deficient clones, increase in large deletion frequency was closely correlated with the increase in the extent of microhomology and the size of small indels, implying a continuity of repair processes across different genomic scales. Furthermore, by targeting diverse genomic sites, we identified examples of repair processes that were highly locus-specific, discovering a role for exonuclease Trex1. Finally, we present evidence that indel sizes increase with the overall efficiency of Cas9 mutagenesis. These findings may have impact on both basic research and clinical use of CRISPR-Cas9, in particular in conjunction with repair pathway modulation.","CRISPR/Cas9 system has revolutionized science and therapy, but DNA damage it causes often goes beyond the desired ’precision editing’.

1991,Approaching intrinsic dynamics of MXenes hybrid hydrogel for 3D printed multimodal intelligent devices with ultrahigh superelasticity and temperature sensitivity,"Hydrogels are investigated broadly in flexible sensors which have been applied into wearable electronics. However, further application of hydrogels is restricted by the ambiguity of the sensing mechanisms, and the multi-functionalization of flexible sensing systems based on hydrogels in terms of cost, difficulty in integration, and device fabrication remains a challenge, obstructing the specific application scenarios. Herein, cost-effective, structure-specialized and scenario-applicable 3D printing of direct ink writing (DIW) technology fabricated two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides (MXenes) bonded hydrogel sensor with excellent strain and temperature sensing performance is developed. Gauge factor (GF) of 5.7 (0 − 191% strain) and high temperature sensitivity (−5.27% °C−1) within wide working range (0 − 80 °C) can be achieved. In particular, the corresponding mechanisms are clarified based on finite element analysis and the first use of in situ temperature-dependent Raman technology for hydrogels, and the printed sensor can realize precise temperature indication of shape memory solar array hinge.","Cost effective device fabrication of powerful hydrogel sensors remains challenging. Here, the authors propose a cost-effective and structure-specialized direct ink writing technique for the fabrication of two-dimensional MXene bonded hydrogel sensors with excellent strain and temperature sensing performance.",2022-06-14
1992,Beam steering at the nanosecond time scale with an atomically thin reflector,"Techniques to mold the flow of light on subwavelength scales enable fundamentally new optical systems and device applications. The realization of programmable, active optical systems with fast, tunable components is among the outstanding challenges in the field. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a few-pixel beam steering device based on electrostatic gate control of excitons in an atomically thin semiconductor with strong light-matter interactions. By combining the high reflectivity of a MoSe2 monolayer with a graphene split-gate geometry, we shape the wavefront phase profile to achieve continuously tunable beam deflection with a range of 10°, two-dimensional beam steering, and switching times down to 1.6 nanoseconds. Our approach opens the door for a new class of atomically thin optical systems, such as rapidly switchable beam arrays and quantum metasurfaces operating at their fundamental thickness limit.","Andersen et al. have demonstrated a new type of beam steering device based on the excitonic response of an atomically thin semiconductor. Using electrostatic gates, the authors achieved tunable steering with switching times on the nanosecond scale.",2022-06-14
1993,Tropical volcanism enhanced the East Asian summer monsoon during the last millennium,"Extreme East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) rainfall frequently induces floods that threaten millions of people, and has been generally attributed to internal climate variability. In contrast to the hydrological weakening theory of volcanic eruptions, here we present convergent empirical and modeling evidence for significant intensification of EASM rainfall in response to strong tropical volcanic eruptions. Our multi-proxy analyses show a significantly increased EASM in the first summer after tropical eruptions from 1470 AD to the present, and the more frequent occurrence of El Niños in the first boreal winter after eruptions is necessary for the enhanced EASM. Model simulation ensembles show that a volcano-induced El Niño and the associated stronger than non-volcanic El Niño warm pool air-sea interaction intensify EASM precipitation, overwhelming volcanic-induced moisture deficiency. This work sheds light on the intertwined relationship between external forcing and internal climate variability and potential flood disasters resulting from tropical volcanic eruptions.","The probability of an El Niño in the winter after large tropical volcanic eruptions increases. When this happens, summer monsoon precipitation over East Asia is enhanced, overwhelming thermodynamic precipitation reduction from volcanic cooling.",2022-06-14
1994,Structural remodeling of ribosome associated Hsp40-Hsp70 chaperones during co-translational folding,"Ribosome associated complex (RAC), an obligate heterodimer of HSP40 and HSP70 (Zuo1 and Ssz1 in yeast), is conserved in eukaryotes and functions as co-chaperone for another HSP70 (Ssb1/2 in yeast) to facilitate co-translational folding of nascent polypeptides. Many mechanistic details, such as the coordination of one HSP40 with two HSP70s and the dynamic interplay between RAC-Ssb and growing nascent chains, remain unclear. Here, we report three sets of structures of RAC-containing ribosomal complexes isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Structural analyses indicate that RAC on the nascent-chain-free ribosome is in an autoinhibited conformation, and in the presence of a nascent chain at the peptide tunnel exit (PTE), RAC undergoes large-scale structural remodeling to make Zuo1 J-Domain more accessible to Ssb. Our data also suggest a role of Zuo1 in orienting Ssb-SBD proximal to the PTE for easy capture of the substrate. Altogether, in accordance with previous data, our work suggests a sequence of structural remodeling events for RAC-Ssb during co-translational folding, triggered by the binding and passage of growing nascent chain from one to another.","Ribosome associated complex (RAC)- HSP70 (Ssb in yeast) is a eukaryotic chaperone system involved in co-translational folding. Here, authors report structures of RAC-containing ribosomal complexes, which suggest a working model for the dynamic actions of RAC-Ssb during the process.",2022-06-14
1995,Automated detection and segmentation of non-small cell lung cancer computed tomography images,"Detection and segmentation of abnormalities on medical images is highly important for patient management including diagnosis, radiotherapy, response evaluation, as well as for quantitative image research. We present a fully automated pipeline for the detection and volumetric segmentation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) developed and validated on 1328 thoracic CT scans from 8 institutions. Along with quantitative performance detailed by image slice thickness, tumor size, image interpretation difficulty, and tumor location, we report an in-silico prospective clinical trial, where we show that the proposed method is faster and more reproducible compared to the experts. Moreover, we demonstrate that on average, radiologists & radiation oncologists preferred automatic segmentations in 56% of the cases. Additionally, we evaluate the prognostic power of the automatic contours by applying RECIST criteria and measuring the tumor volumes. Segmentations by our method stratified patients into low and high survival groups with higher significance compared to those methods based on manual contours.","Correct interpretation of computer tomography (CT) scans is important for the correct assessment of a patient’s disease but can be subjective and timely. Here, the authors develop a system that can automatically segment the non-small cell lung cancer on CT images of patients and show in an in silico trial that the method was faster and more reproducible than clinicians.",2022-06-14
1996,A role for ascorbate conjugates of (+)-catechin in proanthocyanidin polymerization,"Proanthocyanidins (PAs) are natural polymers of flavan-3-ols, commonly (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin. However, exactly how PA oligomerization proceeds is poorly understood. Here we show, both biochemically and genetically, that ascorbate (AsA) is an alternative “starter unit” to flavan-3-ol monomers for leucocyanidin-derived (+)-catechin subunit extension in the Arabidopsis thaliana anthocyanidin synthase (ans) mutant. These (catechin)n:ascorbate conjugates (AsA-[C]n) also accumulate throughout the phase of active PA biosynthesis in wild-type grape flowers, berry skins and seeds. In the presence of (−)-epicatechin, AsA-[C]n can further provide monomeric or oligomeric PA extension units for non-enzymatic polymerization in vitro, and their role in vivo is inferred from analysis of relative metabolite levels in both Arabidopsis and grape. Our findings advance the knowledge of (+)-catechin-type PA extension and indicate that PA oligomerization does not necessarily proceed by sequential addition of a single extension unit. AsA-[C]n defines a new type of PA intermediate which we term “sub-PAs”.",Proanthocyanidins are natural polymers of flavan-3-ols produced by plants. Here the authors provide genetic and biochemical evidence for the involvement of ascorbate linked flavan-3-ol oligomers in the extension of the proanthocyanidin chain.,2022-06-14
1997,Ursodeoxycholic acid reduces antitumor immunosuppression by inducing CHIP-mediated TGF-β degradation,"TGF-β is essential for inducing systemic tumor immunosuppression; thus, blocking TGF-β can greatly enhance antitumor immunity. However, there are still no effective TGF-β inhibitors in clinical use. Here, we show that the clinically approved compound ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), by degrading TGF-β, enhances antitumor immunity through restraining Treg cell differentiation and activation in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, UDCA synergizes with anti-PD-1 to enhance antitumor immunity and tumor-specific immune memory in tumor-bearing mice. UDCA phosphorylates TGF-β at T282 site via TGR5-cAMP-PKA axis, causing increased binding of TGF-β to carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP). Then, CHIP ubiquitinates TGF-β at the K315 site, initiating p62-dependent autophagic sorting and subsequent degradation of TGF-β. Notably, results of retrospective analysis shows that combination therapy with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 and UDCA has better efficacy in tumor patients than anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 alone. Thus, our results show a mechanism for TGF-β regulation and implicate UDCA as a potential TGF-β inhibitor to enhance antitumor immunity.",TGF-β can function to increase Treg cell function and reduce anti-tumour immunity. Here the authors show that UDCA is a potential mediator that can reduce TGF-β activity and promote anti-tumour immune responses in mice and can be additive to other checkpoint inhibitors.,2022-06-14
1998,"A westerly wind dominated Puna Plateau during deposition of upper Pleistocene loessic sediments in the subtropical Andes, South America","The Tafí del Valle depression (~27° S) in the eastern Andes of Argentina provides a record of late Pleistocene dust deposition in the subtropics of South America. We present large-n U-Pb geochronology data for detrital zircons from upper Pleistocene loess-paleosol deposits. When compared to regional data, the age spectra from the Tafí del Valle samples are most like the southern Puna Plateau, supporting derivation largely from the west and northwest. This runs counter to hypotheses suggesting these loessic sediments were derived from the low elevation plains to the east or extra-Andean Patagonia. Mapping of linear wind erosion features on the Puna Plateau yield a mean orientation of 125.7° (1 s.d. = 12.4°). These new data and existing records are consistent with a westerly-northwesterly dominated (upper- and lower-level) wind system over the southern Puna Plateau (to at least ~27° S) during periods of high dust accumulation in Tafí del Valle.",Detrital zircon ages in Pleistocene sediments and wind erosion patterns indicate the Puna Plateau was dominated by westerly winds during intervals of high dust accumulation in the eastern subtropical Andes.,2022-06-14
1999,A framework for the general design and computation of hybrid neural networks,"There is a growing trend to design hybrid neural networks (HNNs) by combining spiking neural networks and artificial neural networks to leverage the strengths of both. Here, we propose a framework for general design and computation of HNNs by introducing hybrid units (HUs) as a linkage interface. The framework not only integrates key features of these computing paradigms but also decouples them to improve flexibility and efficiency. HUs are designable and learnable to promote transmission and modulation of hybrid information flows in HNNs. Through three cases, we demonstrate that the framework can facilitate hybrid model design. The hybrid sensing network implements multi-pathway sensing, achieving high tracking accuracy and energy efficiency. The hybrid modulation network implements hierarchical information abstraction, enabling meta-continual learning of multiple tasks. The hybrid reasoning network performs multimodal reasoning in an interpretable, robust and parallel manner. This study advances cross-paradigm modeling for a broad range of intelligent tasks.","Hybrid neural networks combine advantages of spiking and artificial neural networks in the context of computing and biological motivation. The authors propose a design framework with hybrid units for improved flexibility and efficiency of hybrid neural networks, and modulation of hybrid information flows.",2022-06-14
